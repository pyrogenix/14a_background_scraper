• “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;

• “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger; and

• “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the EGC special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further
solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Dear Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. Stockholder:

The board of directors of Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. (“EGC”) approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger among EGC, MLCJR LLC, a
Texas limited liability company (“Cox”), and YHIMONE, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox (“Merger
Sub”) (the “merger agreement”), which provides for the acquisition of EGC by Cox. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into EGC, with EGC surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox (the “merger”).

If the merger is completed, each share of EGC common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding at the effective time of the
merger, will be converted into the right to receive $9.10 in cash without interest (the “merger consideration”). EGC common stock is currently trading
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “EGC.” We urge you to obtain current market quotations of EGC common stock.

At a special meeting of EGC stockholders, EGC stockholders will be asked to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. Approval of this
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock entitled to vote at the
EGC special meeting. At the EGC special meeting, EGC stockholders will also be asked to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger. At
the EGC special meeting, EGC stockholders may also be asked to approve an adjournment of the EGC special meeting to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the EGC special meeting to adopt the
merger agreement.

The EGC board of directors has unanimously adopted and approved the merger and the merger agreement and unanimously
recommends that the EGC stockholders vote:

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of EGC common stock you own. Regardless of whether you plan to attend
the EGC special meeting in person, please complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope, or submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet, prior to the EGC special meeting to ensure that your shares of EGC
common stock will be represented at the EGC special meeting if you are unable to attend. If you attend the EGC special meeting and vote in person,
your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. The failure to vote your shares of EGC common stock will have the same effect
as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

If your shares of EGC common stock are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee will be unable to vote your shares of EGC common stock without instructions from you. You should instruct your bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee on how to vote your shares of EGC common stock in accordance with the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee. The failure to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of EGC common stock will have the
same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Submitting a proxy will not prevent you from voting in person, but it will help to secure a quorum and avoid added solicitation costs. Any
eligible record holder of EGC common stock who is present at the EGC special meeting may vote in person, thereby revoking any previous proxy. In
any event, a proxy may be revoked in writing at any time before the EGC special meeting in the manner described in the accompanying proxy
statement. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, please follow the instructions on the voting instruction card
furnished by your bank, broker or other nominee.

The obligations of Cox and EGC to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions. The
accompanying proxy statement contains detailed information about Cox, EGC, the EGC special meeting, the merger agreement and the
merger. We encourage you to read the proxy statement carefully and in its entirety before voting.

On behalf of the board of directors and management of EGC, we thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Gary C. Hanna 
Chairman of the Board Douglas E. Brooks 

Chief Executive Officer and President

The proxy statement is dated August 3, 2018 and, together with the form of proxy, is first being sent to stockholders on or about August 3, 2018.

SUMMARY

This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and may not contain all
the information that is important to you with respect to the merger and the other matters being considered at the
EGC special meeting. EGC urges you to read the remainder of this proxy statement carefully, including the

The Companies

Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc.

Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. was formed in December 2016 after emerging from a voluntary reorganization
under chapter 11 proceedings as the restructured successor of EXXI Ltd. EGC is headquartered in Houston,
Texas, and engages in the development, exploitation, and operation of oil and natural gas properties primarily
offshore on the Gulf of Mexico (“GoM”) Shelf, which is an area in less than 1,000 feet of water, and also onshore
in Louisiana and Texas. EGC owns and operates nine of the largest GoM Shelf oil fields ranked by total
cumulative oil production to date and utilizes various techniques to increase the recovery factor and thus increase
the total oil recovered. At December 31, 2017, EGC’s total proved reserves were 88.2 MMBOE of which 84%
were oil and 75% were classified as proved developed. As of that date, EGC operated or had an interest in 577
gross producing wells on 421,974 net developed acres, including interests in 55 producing fields.

EGC’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “EGC.”

The principal executive offices of EGC are located at 1021 Main, Suite 2626, Houston, Texas 77002, and
EGC’s telephone number is (713) 351-3000. Additional information about EGC and its subsidiaries is included in

which are privately-held affiliated entities that own and operate assets in the Gulf of Mexico and were founded by
fourth generation oilman, Brad E. Cox. Cox has grown through enhanced development of production and
reserves in existing assets along with strategic acquisitions. Cox’s assets are located in both the Outer Continental
Shelf and the shallow waters off the coast of Louisiana. Cox Oil currently operates more than 200 producing
wells over 25 fields. Cox is based in Dallas, Texas with operation staff in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The principal executive offices of Cox are located at 4514 Cole Avenue, Suite 1175, Dallas, Texas 75205,
and Cox’s telephone number is (214) 420-7710.

YHIMONE, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox, is a Delaware corporation that was formed on
June 15, 2018 for the sole purpose of effecting the merger. The principal executive office address and telephone
number for Merger Sub are the same as for Cox. In the merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into EGC,
with EGC surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox.

Merger” and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on pages 28 and 65, respectively;

or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Only record holders of shares of EGC common stock at the close of business on August 3, 2018, the record
date for the EGC special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the EGC special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of business on the record date, the only outstanding voting
securities of EGC were common stock, and 33,396,563 shares of EGC common stock were issued and
outstanding.

With respect to each EGC proposal listed above, EGC stockholders may cast one vote for each share of EGC
common stock that they own as of the record date. The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock that are
entitled to vote thereon at the EGC special meeting. No business may be transacted at the EGC special meeting
unless a quorum is present. If a quorum is not present, to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies,
the EGC special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Additionally, if fewer shares are voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
than is required, the EGC special meeting may be adjourned to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement. The EGC bylaws permit the chairman of the board to adjourn the meeting without
a stockholder vote, regardless of whether a quorum is present. No notice of an adjourned meeting need be given
unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting.

EGC’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the EGC Board of Directors (see page 40)

After careful consideration, the EGC board of directors unanimously adopted and approved the merger
agreement; determined that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of EGC and its stockholders; and recommended that the merger agreement be adopted by EGC’s
stockholders. For more information regarding the factors considered by the EGC board of directors in reaching its
decision to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement, see the section titled “The Merger — EGC’s
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the EGC Board of Directors.” The EGC board of directors
unanimously recommends that the EGC stockholders vote:

Opinion of EGC’s Financial Advisor (see page 44)

EGC engaged Intrepid Partners, LLC (“Intrepid”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with the
merger. On June 17, 2018, Intrepid delivered to the EGC board of directors its oral opinion, confirmed by its
delivery of a written opinion dated as of the same date, that, as of the date thereof, and based upon and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in Intrepid’s
written opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to
EGC’s stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox).

The full text of Intrepid’s written opinion, dated June 17, 2018, which sets forth, among other things,
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Intrepid, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein.
The summary of Intrepid’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the opinion. Holders of EGC common stock are encouraged to read the opinion and the description
carefully and in their entirety. Intrepid provided its opinion solely for the information and benefit of the EGC
board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger. Intrepid’s opinion
necessarily was based upon information made available to Intrepid as of June 17, 2018 and financial, economic,
market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated by Intrepid on that date. Intrepid has no
obligation to, and will not, update, revise or reaffirm its opinion based on subsequent developments. The opinion
is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any EGC stockholder as to how that
stockholder should act or vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

For additional information, see the section titled “The Merger — Opinion of EGC’s Financial Advisor”
beginning on page 44 and Annex B.

The Merger

A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read
the entire merger agreement carefully because it is the principal document governing the merger. For more
information on the merger agreement, see the section titled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 65.

Form of the Merger (see page 65)

The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions in the merger agreement, at
the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into EGC. EGC will be
the surviving corporation in the merger and will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox.

See the section titled “The Merger — Terms of the Merger; Merger Consideration.”

Merger Consideration (see page 65)

Upon completion of the merger, each share of EGC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time (excluding shares held by EGC in treasury, any shares held by Cox or Merger Sub and any
shares held by any other subsidiary of Cox or EGC and dissenting shares in accordance with Delaware law) will
be converted into the right to receive $9.10 cash without interest.

The closing price of EGC common stock as of August 3, 2018 was $9.01 per share.

See the section titled “The Merger Agreement — Terms of the Merger; Merger Consideration.”

Treatment of EGC Equity Awards (see page 75)

EGC RSUs.   Immediately prior to the effective time, the vesting of each outstanding EGC restricted stock
unit (each, an “EGC RSU”) will accelerate (if not already vested), with any performance conditions deemed
achieved at target, and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, multiplied
by the number of shares of EGC common stock subject to that EGC RSU.

Stock Options.   The exercise price for each outstanding stock option is greater than the merger
consideration. As a result, at the effective time, each stock option to purchase shares of EGC common stock will
be cancelled for no consideration.

See the section titled “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of EGC Equity Awards.”

Treatment of EGC Warrants (see page 63)

The exercise price for each outstanding warrant is greater than the merger consideration. As a result, at the
effective time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of EGC common stock will be cancelled for no
consideration.

See the section titled “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of EGC Warrants.”

Expected Timing of the Merger (see page 66)

Cox and EGC currently expect the closing of the merger to occur in the third calendar quarter of 2018.
However, the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions as described in the merger agreement,
and it is possible that factors outside the control of Cox and EGC could result in the merger being completed at a
later time or not at all. See the section titled “The Merger Agreement — Completion of the Merger” for a
discussion of the closing of the merger.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 76)

The obligations of EGC, Cox and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the following conditions on or prior to the closing date, any or all of which may be waived jointly by
the parties to the merger agreement, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

In addition, the obligations of Cox and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions at the closing date:

with respect to EGC capital stock, or (iii) seeking to compel EGC, Cox or any of their subsidiaries to
dispose of or hold separate any material assets as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement;

In addition, the obligation of EGC to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
following conditions at the closing date:

No Solicitation of Competing Proposals (see page 71)

The merger agreement precludes EGC from soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations with
respect to a competing proposal regarding an alternative transaction. However, if EGC receives an unsolicited
competing proposal from a third party, and the EGC board of directors, among other things, reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors) that
such competing proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a superior proposal to the merger, EGC may furnish
non-public information to and enter into discussions with that third party regarding such competing proposal. See
the section titled “The Merger Agreement — No Solicitation of Competing Proposals” for a discussion of these
and related rights of EGC to terminate the merger agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 77)

Cox and EGC may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time, whether before or after
the receipt of the required EGC stockholder approval. Additionally, either Cox or EGC can terminate the merger
agreement if  (i) there is a permanent injunction or adoption of any law that prohibits the merger, (ii) EGC’s
stockholders do not approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (iii) the merger is not consummated on
or before November 15, 2018, subject to certain exceptions or (iv) the other party has breached the merger
agreement and such breach would cause the conditions to the closing of the merger not to be satisfied. Cox may
also terminate the merger agreement if the EGC board of directors changes its recommendation to the EGC
stockholders. EGC may terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a
superior proposal, but only if EGC concurrently pays the termination fee to Cox and EGC complied in all
material respects with its obligations under the merger agreement relating to that superior proposal. See the
section titled “The Merger Agreement — Termination of the Merger Agreement” for a discussion of these and
other rights of each of Cox and EGC to terminate the merger agreement.

• Equity Awards.   Each executive officer and director has received grants of EGC RSUs. Immediately
prior to the effective time, the vesting of each outstanding EGC RSU will accelerate (if not already
vested), with any performance conditions deemed achieved at target, and be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares of EGC common
stock subject to that EGC RSU.

• Employment Agreements.   Each of EGC’s executive officers is party to an employment agreement with
EGC, and each such employment agreement provides for certain cash payments and other severance
benefits (including the accelerated vesting of certain equity-based awards) in the event of certain
qualifying terminations of employment following the merger.

• Indemnification.   EGC’s directors and executive officers are entitled to indemnification and insurance
coverage under EGC’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, indemnification agreements and the
merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Effect of Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 78)

If the merger agreement is terminated by any party in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement will
become void, and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of any party to the merger agreement, except
with respect to: (i) Cox’s unauthorized use of information for purposes unrelated to the transactions under the
merger agreement; (ii) any applicable termination fees or expense reimbursement obligations; and (iii) the
general provisions of the merger agreement. However, no such termination will relieve any party from liability
for any damages of the parties to the merger agreement for a willful and material breach under the merger
agreement or fraud (up to a maximum limit on damages of  $35,000,000 for each party).

Termination Fees and Expenses (see page 79)

Generally, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, regardless of whether
the merger is completed. However, in certain circumstances EGC may be required to pay Cox a termination fee
of  $8,000,000 and/or to reimburse Cox for its documented out-of-pocket expenses up to $2,000,000. See the
section titled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees and Expenses” for a discussion of the circumstances
under which such termination fee or expense reimbursement will be required to be paid.

De-Listing and Deregistration of Shares of EGC Common Stock (see page 63)

Upon completion of the merger, the shares of EGC common stock currently listed on the NASDAQ will
cease to be listed on the NASDAQ and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Interests of EGC Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 56)

Some of EGC’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, those of EGC’s stockholders generally. The EGC board of directors was aware of and
considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and in recommending to you that you approve the
proposals submitted for the EGC stockholder vote set forth in this proxy statement. These interests include:

For a more detailed discussion of these interests, see “The Merger — Interests of EGC Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Appraisal Rights (see page 86)

Under Delaware law, holders of shares of EGC common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the merger, provided that such holders satisfy fully all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the “DGCL”). A holder of EGC common stock who
properly demands appraisal and complies precisely with the applicable

TABLE OF CONTENTS

requirements under Delaware law (which we refer to as a “dissenting stockholder”) will not be entitled to receive
the merger consideration provided by the merger agreement and instead will receive a cash payment of the
amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of EGC
common stock at the effective time, together with interest on such amount from the effective time until paid. The
ultimate amount dissenting stockholders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more or less than, or the same
as, the amount such holders would have received under the merger agreement. A detailed description of the
appraisal rights available to holders of EGC common stock and procedures required to exercise statutory
appraisal rights is included in the section titled “Appraisal Rights.”

To perfect appraisal rights, an EGC stockholder of record must, among other things, deliver a written
demand for appraisal to EGC before the vote on the merger agreement at the EGC special meeting, not vote in
favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, continuously hold the shares of EGC common stock through
the date the merger is completed, and otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Delaware law will result in the loss of appraisal
rights.

Payment Procedures (see page 63)

Prior to the effective time, Cox will designate a national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
EGC to act as agent for the holders of EGC common stock in connection with the merger to receive the cash
necessary to make the cash payments contemplated by the merger agreement.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, and in any event within two business days
thereafter, Cox or EGC, as the surviving corporation after the merger, shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in
trust with the paying agent to mail to each holder of a certificate formerly representing a share of EGC common
stock or any corresponding book-entry share of EGC common stock (“book-entry share”) a letter of transmittal
specifying, among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates
representing EGC common stock will pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the paying agent or,
in the case of book-entry shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in such letter. The letter will also
include instructions explaining the procedure for surrendering EGC stock certificates or book-entry shares in
exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of EGC stock certificates or book-entry shares may thereafter
until the first anniversary of the effective time surrender such certificates or book-entry shares to the paying
agent, as agent for such holder, under cover of the letter of transmittal.

All payments with respect to EGC RSUs will be made through the surviving corporation’s payroll system,
and the surviving corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of an EGC RSU pursuant to the merger agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of that payment under applicable law, including taxes.

After the effective time, shares of EGC common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be automatically
canceled and will cease to exist and each certificate, if any, that previously represented shares of EGC common
stock will represent only the right to receive the merger consideration as described above.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 83)

The receipt of the merger consideration by a U.S. holder (as such term is defined below under “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) of EGC common stock in exchange for shares of EGC common stock
pursuant to the merger will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S.
holder who receives the merger consideration in exchange for shares of EGC common stock pursuant to the
merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any,
between (i) the amount of cash received, and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of EGC
common stock.

A non-U.S. holder (as such term is defined below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”)
of EGC common stock is generally not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of its receipt
of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of EGC common stock pursuant to

the merger, unless the non-U.S. holder (i) is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or
periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year of the merger and certain other conditions are met,
(ii) is engaged in trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, maintains a
permanent establishment in the United States), or (iii) actually or constructively owns, or owned at any time
during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger or, if shorter, the non-U.S. holder’s holding period
for its EGC common stock, more than 5% of the shares of EGC common stock.

For a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders
of EGC common stock, see the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” Holders of EGC
common stock are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the specific tax consequences to
them of the merger, including the effect of any federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws. Tax matters can be
complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation.
You are encouraged to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Summary Selected Consolidated Historical Financial Data of EGC

The following selected income statement, cash flow and balance sheet data for the year ended December 31,
2017 and as of December 31, 2016 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of EGC
contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and the following
selected income statement, cash flow, and balance sheet data for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and
March 31, 2017 have been derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of EGC contained in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, each of which is incorporated into
this proxy statement by reference. EGC’s predecessor, EXXI Ltd, emerged from bankruptcy on December 30,
2016 (the “emergence date”). In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 852,
Reorganizations, EGC applied fresh start accounting upon EGC’s predecessor’s emergence from bankruptcy and
it evaluated transaction activity between the emergence date and December 31, 2016 and concluded that an
accounting convenience date of December 31, 2016 was appropriate.

You should read this summary financial data together with the financial statements that are incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement and their accompanying notes and management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations of EGC contained in such reports. See “Where You Can Find More

(2) On the accounting convenience date EGC selected upon emergence from bankruptcy, subsequent to the
restructuring adjustments and fair value adjustments, EGC recorded an impairment of its oil and natural gas
properties of  $406.3 million, due to the differences between the fair value of oil and natural gas properties
recorded as part of fresh start accounting and the limitation of capitalized costs prescribed under

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?

A: Cox and EGC have agreed to a business combination pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement that is
described in this proxy statement. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this proxy statement as
Annex A.

Q: What effect will the merger have?

A: Cox and EGC have entered into the merger agreement pursuant to which EGC will become an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Cox and EGC stockholders will receive the merger consideration in exchange
for their shares of EGC common stock. EGC will cease to be listed on the NASDAQ and will subsequently
be deregistered under the Exchange Act publicly traded company at the effective time.

Q: What will I receive in the merger if it is completed?

A: At the effective time of the merger, each share of EGC common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to such effective time (excluding any shares held by Cox or Merger Sub and any shares held by any
other subsidiary of Cox or EGC and dissenting shares in accordance with Delaware law) will be converted
into the right to receive $9.10 cash without interest. Because treasury shares are not “outstanding” shares of
common stock for purposes of the DGCL, any treasury shares held by EGC at the effective time will
effectively be treated the same as excluded shares.

Q: When and where will the EGC special meeting be held?

A: The EGC special meeting will be held at 1021 Main, 1st Floor, Houston, Texas on September 6, 2018, at
9:00 a.m., Houston time.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the EGC special meeting?

A: The record date for the EGC special meeting is August 3, 2018. Only record holders of shares of EGC
common stock at the close of business on such date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the EGC special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Q: What constitutes a quorum at the EGC special meeting?

A: Stockholders who hold shares representing at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of all issued
and outstanding shares of EGC common stock entitled to vote at the EGC special meeting must be present in
person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum.

Q: How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?

A: If you were a record holder of EGC common stock at the close of business on the record date for the EGC
special meeting, you may vote in person by attending the EGC special meeting or, to ensure that your shares
are represented at the EGC special meeting, you may vote or authorize a proxy to vote using one or more of
the following methods:

• Internet.   You may submit a proxy electronically on the Internet by following the instructions at
www.proxyvote.com. You will need the control number that appears on your proxy card to vote online.

Q: My shares are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee. Will my bank, broker or
other nominee automatically vote my shares for me?

A: No. If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
holder” of the shares held for you in what is known as “street name.” The “record holder” of such shares is
your bank, broker or other nominee, and not you. If this is the case, this proxy statement has been forwarded
to you by your bank, broker or other nominee. You must provide the record holder of your shares with
instructions on how to vote your shares. Otherwise, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your
shares on any of the proposals to be considered at the EGC special meeting, and a broker non-vote will
result.

• the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;

• no effect on the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
proposed merger; and

• no effect on the proposal to approve the adjournment of the EGC special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

Q: How many votes do I have?

A: With respect to each proposal to be presented at the EGC special meeting, holders of EGC common stock as
of the record date are entitled to one vote for each share of EGC common stock owned at the close of
business on the record date. At the close of business on the record date, there were       shares of EGC
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the EGC special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal?

A: The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the issued
and outstanding shares of EGC common stock. Failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of such proposal.

Q: How does the EGC board of directors recommend that EGC stockholders vote?

A: The EGC board of directors has unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement and determined
that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
EGC and its stockholders. Accordingly, the EGC board of directors unanimously recommends that EGC
stockholders vote:

• “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;

• “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid
or become payable to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
proposed merger; and

• “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the EGC special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

Q: What will happen if I fail to vote or I abstain from voting?

A: If you fail to vote, it will have (i) the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, (ii) no effect on the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates
to the proposed merger and (iii) no effect on the proposal to approve the adjournment of the EGC special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement.

Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?

A: If you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of EGC common
stock should be voted on a proposal, the shares of EGC common stock represented by your proxy will be
voted as the EGC board of directors recommends and, therefore,

• “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable
to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock
present, in person or represented by proxy, at the EGC special meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting
and which have actually been voted, assuming there is a quorum present. If you attend the EGC special
meeting or are represented by proxy and, in either case, abstain from voting, that abstention will have the
same effect as voting “AGAINST” this proposal. Failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect
on the vote for this proposal.

The adjournment of the EGC special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in
favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of EGC common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to
vote at the meeting, regardless of whether a quorum is present. If you attend the EGC special meeting or are
represented by proxy and, in either case, abstain from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as
voting “AGAINST” this proposal. Failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for
this proposal.

However, if you attend the EGC special meeting or are represented by proxy and, in either case, abstain
from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” all three proposals.

• “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid
or become payable to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
proposed merger; and

• “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the EGC special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

Q: Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?

A: Yes.

• timely delivering a signed written notice of revocation;

• timely delivering a new, valid proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or through the
internet); or

• attending the EGC special meeting and voting in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy
previously given, or revoking your proxy in person. Simply attending the EGC special meeting without
voting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or change your vote.

Q: What are the expected material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a U.S. holder of
EGC common stock?

A: The receipt of the merger consideration by a U.S. holder (as such term is defined below under “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) of cash in exchange for shares of EGC common stock pursuant to
the merger will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder
who receives the merger consideration in exchange for shares of EGC common stock pursuant to the merger
will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any,
between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of EGC
common stock.

Q: What are the expected material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a non-U.S.
holder of EGC common stock?

A: A non-U.S. holder (as such term is defined below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”)
of EGC common stock is generally not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of its
receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of EGC common stock pursuant to the merger,
unless the non-U.S. holder (i) is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods
aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year of the merger and certain other conditions are met,
(ii) is engaged in trade or business in the United States (and, if

If you are the record holder of EGC common stock, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any
time before your proxy is voted at the applicable special meeting. You can do this by:

If you choose either of the first two methods, your notice of revocation or your new proxy must be received
by the Secretary of EGC no later than the beginning of the applicable special meeting.

Regardless of the method used to deliver your previous proxy, you may revoke your proxy by any of the
above methods.

If you hold shares of EGC in “street name,” you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to change
your vote.

For a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S.
holders of EGC common stock, see the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”
beginning on page 83. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you
will depend on your particular tax situation. You are encouraged to consult your tax advisor to
determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: Cox and EGC hope to complete the merger as soon as reasonably possible and expect the closing of the
merger to occur in the third calendar quarter of 2018. However, the merger is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Cox and EGC could result in
the merger being completed at a later time or not at all.

Q: Do I need to do anything with my shares of common stock other than vote for the proposals at the
EGC special meeting?

A: No. Do NOT submit any stock certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) with your proxy card.

Q: How will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?

A: You will be paid the merger consideration as promptly as practicable after the effective time and after receipt
by the paying agent of your stock certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form), a duly executed
letter of transmittal and any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the form of letter of
transmittal. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash amounts received as merger consideration. See
“The Merger Agreement — Exchange Procedures.”

Q: Should I send in my share certificates now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive transmittal materials from the paying agent for the
merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of EGC common stock for the
consideration to be paid to former EGC stockholders in connection with the merger. If you are the beneficial
owner of shares of EGC common stock held in “street name,” you may receive instructions from your
broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of such
shares.

Q: What will happen to EGC’s restricted stock units in the merger?

A: Immediately prior to the effective time, the vesting of each outstanding EGC RSU will accelerate (if not
already vested), with any performance conditions deemed achieved at target, and be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares of EGC common stock
subject to that EGC RSU.

Q: What will happen to EGC’s stock options in the merger?

A: The exercise price for each outstanding stock option is greater than the merger consideration. As a result, at
the effective time, each outstanding stock option to purchase shares of EGC common stock will be cancelled
for no consideration.

Q: What will happen to EGC’s warrants in the merger?

A: The exercise price for each outstanding warrant is greater than the merger consideration. As a result, at the
effective time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of EGC common stock will be cancelled for no
consideration.

merger or, if shorter, the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for its EGC common stock, more than 5% of the

U.S. holders of EGC common stock, see the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences” beginning on page 83. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the
merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You are encouraged to consult your tax

Q: Are EGC stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?

A: Yes. Under Delaware law, if the merger is completed, in lieu of receiving the merger consideration provided
by the merger agreement, holders of record of EGC common stock who do not vote in favor of adopting the
merger agreement will have the right to demand appraisal of the fair value of their shares by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and to receive a cash payment of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery as the
fair value, together with interest on that amount from the effective time until such payment is made. In order
to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Appraisal rights will be available only to holders of EGC common stock who deliver a written demand for
appraisal to EGC prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the EGC special
meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. These
procedures and requirements are summarized in this proxy statement. If the holders of more than 10% of the
outstanding shares of EGC common stock demand appraisal, then Cox is not required to consummate the
merger. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would
be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is
included as Annex C to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section titled “Appraisal
Rights” beginning on page 86.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of EGC common stock before the EGC special meeting?

A: The record date for the EGC special meeting is earlier than the date of the EGC special meeting and the date
that the merger is expected to be completed. If you transfer your EGC shares after the record date but before
the EGC special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the EGC special meeting, but will have
transferred the right to receive the merger consideration in the merger. In order to receive the merger
consideration, you must hold your shares through the effective time.

Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one set of materials?

A: This means you own shares of EGC common stock that are registered under different names. For example,
you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and other shares through a bank, broker or
other nominee or you may own shares through more than one bank, broker or other nominee. In these
situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must complete, sign and return all of the
proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the voting instruction
forms you receive in order to vote all of the shares of EGC common stock that you own. Each proxy card
you receive will come with its own self-addressed, stamped envelope; if you submit your proxy by mail,
make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanied that proxy card.

Q: How can I find out more information?

A: For more information about Cox and EGC, as well as about the merger agreement, the merger and the EGC
special meeting, see the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 99.

Q. What is householding and how does it affect me?

A. The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering
a single proxy statement to those stockholders, unless contrary instructions have been received. This
procedure reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and
mailing costs for companies. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial
owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding
common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. You may
decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies of proxy
materials. If you wish to opt out of this procedure and receive a separate set of proxy materials in the future,
or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one, you should contact your broker,
trustee or other nominee or EGC at the address and

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are not limited to historical
facts, but reflect EGC’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events. These forward-looking
statements relate not only to the proposed merger, but also to EGC’s financial and operating performance on a

Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended

number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed. While management believes that these forward-
looking statements are reasonable, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results
or developments anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, may not have the expected
consequences to or effects on EGC’s business or results. Our forward-looking statements involve significant risks
and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Important factors that could

all risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all factors on EGC’s business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking

Completion of the merger is conditioned on the adoption of the merger agreement by the EGC stockholders.

Recommendation of the EGC Board of Directors

At a special meeting held on June 17, 2018, the EGC board of directors adopted and approved the merger
agreement and determined that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of EGC and its stockholders. Accordingly, the EGC board of directors unanimously
recommends that EGC stockholders vote:

common stock at the close of business on such date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the EGC special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of business on the record date, the only
outstanding voting securities of EGC were common stock, and 33,396,563 shares of EGC common stock were

• The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock. Each share of EGC common stock outstanding
on the record date of the EGC special meeting is entitled to one vote on this proposal. Failures to vote,
broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of such
proposal.

• The approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of EGC
common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the EGC special meeting and entitled to vote on the
proposal, assuming there is a quorum at the EGC special meeting. Each share of EGC common stock
outstanding on the record date of the EGC special meeting is entitled to one vote on this proposal. If
you attend the EGC special meeting or are represented by proxy and, in either case, abstain from
voting, that abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” this proposal. Failures to vote
and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for this proposal.

Main, Suite 2626, Houston, Texas and will also be available at the EGC special meeting for examination by any
EGC stockholder present at such meeting.

Each share of EGC common stock outstanding on the record date of the EGC special meeting is entitled to
one vote on each proposal and any other matter coming before the EGC special meeting.

Voting by EGC’s Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on the record date of the EGC special meeting, EGC directors and executive officers
were entitled to vote 86,794 shares of EGC common stock, representing less than 1% of the shares of EGC
common stock outstanding on that date.

Quorum

No business may be transacted at the EGC special meeting unless a quorum is present. Stockholders who
hold shares representing at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of all issued and outstanding shares
of EGC common stock entitled to vote at the EGC special meeting must be present in person or represented by
proxy to constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present, to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies,
the EGC special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Additionally, if fewer shares are voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
than is required, to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies, the EGC special meeting may be
adjourned to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. EGC’s bylaws
permit the chairman of the board to adjourn the meeting without a stockholder vote, regardless of whether a
quorum is present. No notice of an adjourned meeting need be given unless the adjournment is for more than
30 days or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At any
adjourned meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original
convening of the EGC special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn
prior to the adjourned meeting.

All shares of EGC common stock represented at the EGC special meeting, including shares that are
represented but that vote to abstain, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence
of a quorum. Broker non-votes will have no effect on determining the presence or absence of a quorum at the
EGC special meeting.

Required Vote

The required votes to approve the EGC proposals are as follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Granting of Proxies by Holders of Record

If you were a record holder of EGC common stock at the close of business on the record date of the EGC
special meeting, a proxy card is enclosed for your use. EGC requests that you submit your proxy as promptly as
possible by (i) accessing the internet site listed on the EGC proxy card, (ii) calling the toll-free number listed on
the EGC proxy card or (iii) submitting your EGC proxy card by mail by using the provided self-addressed,
stamped envelope. Information and applicable deadlines for submitting a proxy through the internet or by
telephone are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly executed,
the shares of EGC common stock represented by it will be voted at the EGC special meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy card. Your internet or
telephone submission authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had marked,
signed and returned a proxy card.

If a proxy is returned without an indication as to how the shares of EGC common stock represented are to be
voted with regard to a particular proposal, the EGC common stock represented by the proxy will be voted in
accordance with the recommendation of the EGC board of directors and, therefore,

At the date hereof, the EGC board of directors has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for
consideration at the EGC special meeting and that would be required to be set forth in this proxy statement or the
related proxy card other than the matters set forth in EGC’s notice of special meeting of stockholders. If any other
matter is properly presented at the EGC special meeting for consideration, it is intended that the persons named in
the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their best judgment on such
matter.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, if you were a record holder of EGC common stock on the record
date of the EGC special meeting, please sign and return the enclosed proxy card or submit your proxy via
the internet or telephone regardless of whether you plan to attend the EGC special meeting in person.
Proxies submitted through the specified internet website or by phone must be received by 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on September 5, 2018, the day before the EGC special meeting.

Shares Held in Street Name

If you hold shares of EGC common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the
“beneficial holder” of the shares held for you in what is known as “street name.” The “record holder” of such
shares is your broker, bank or other nominee, and not you, and you must provide the record holder of your shares
with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank
or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly
to EGC or by voting in person at the EGC special meeting unless

• timely delivering a signed written notice of revocation;
• timely delivering a new, valid proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or through the

internet); or

you have a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Furthermore, brokers,
banks or other nominees who hold shares of EGC common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a
proxy to EGC to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.

If you are an EGC stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote
your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of the EGC proposals.

Voting in Person

If you plan to attend the EGC special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the
EGC special meeting. If you are a registered stockholder, please be prepared to provide proper identification,
such as a driver’s license, at the EGC special meeting. If your shares are held in “street name,” you must bring to
the EGC special meeting a “legal proxy” executed in your favor from the record holder (your broker, bank or
other nominee) of the shares authorizing you to vote at the EGC special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies

If you are the record holder of EGC common stock, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any
time before your proxy is voted at the EGC special meeting. You can do this by:

A registered stockholder may revoke a proxy by any of these methods, regardless of the method used to
deliver the stockholder’s previous proxy. Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to
the revocation of proxies should be addressed as follows:

Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. 
1021 Main, Suite 2626 
Houston, Texas 77002 

(713) 351-3000 
Attention: Corporate Secretary

If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your
voting instructions by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee in accordance with its
established procedures. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee and you decide to
change your vote by attending the EGC special meeting and voting in person, your vote in person at the EGC
special meeting will not be effective unless you have obtained and present an executed “legal proxy” in your
favor from the record holder (your broker, bank or nominee).

Tabulation of Votes

EGC has appointed a representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to serve as the Inspector of
Votes for the EGC special meeting. The Inspector of Votes will independently tabulate affirmative and negative
votes and abstentions.

Solicitation of Proxies

EGC is soliciting proxies for the EGC special meeting from its stockholders. In accordance with the merger
agreement, EGC will pay its own cost of soliciting proxies, including the cost of mailing this proxy statement,
from its stockholders. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by EGC’s officers,
directors and regular employees, without additional remuneration, by personal interview, telephone or other
means of communication.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EGC will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy
solicitation materials to beneficial owners of EGC common stock. EGC may reimburse these brokerage houses,
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy materials.

To help ensure the presence in person or by proxy of the largest number of stockholders possible, EGC has
engaged MacKenzie, a proxy solicitation firm, to solicit proxies on EGC’s behalf. EGC has agreed to pay
MacKenzie a retainer of  $40,000, to be applied to the final proxy solicitation fee. In the event of a contested
solicitation or public opposition to the merger, EGC and MacKenzie will mutually agree on an appropriate final
fee based upon customary fees for the proxy solicitation services that MacKenzie provides. If there is no
contested solicitation or public opposition, the final fee would be $40,000. EGC will also reimburse MacKenzie
for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

Adjournments

Any adjournment of the EGC special meeting may be made from time to time by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of EGC common stock, present in person or by proxy at
the EGC special meeting and entitled to vote thereon, and which have actually been voted, without further notice
other than by an announcement made at the EGC special meeting (unless the adjournment is for more than
30 days or if a new record date is fixed). If a quorum is present at the EGC special meeting but there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the EGC special meeting to approve the proposal to issue shares of EGC common
stock in connection with the merger, then EGC stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the
EGC special meeting so as to permit the further solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. EGC’s bylaws permit the chairman of the board to adjourn the meeting without a stockholder
vote, regardless of whether a quorum is present.

THE MERGER

Effects of the Merger

At the effective time, Merger Sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox that was formed for the sole
purpose of effecting the merger, will merge with and into EGC. EGC will survive the merger and become an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cox.

In the merger, each share of EGC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will be converted into the right to receive $9.10 cash without interest.

Background of the Merger

Since EGC’s emergence from Chapter 11 reorganization on December 30, 2016, the EGC board of directors
undertook a number of initiatives in order to, among other things:

However, since emergence, EGC has faced a number of headwinds – including operational challenges
resulting in production declines and liquidity issues – that adversely affected EGC’s ability to achieve the
intended results of these initiatives. As these headwinds developed and persisted, the EGC board of directors has
been attentive to opportunities to help EGC better face these challenges.

In keeping with the EGC board of directors’ focus on pursuing strategic alternatives and enhancing
stockholder value, on March 20, 2017, EGC announced that it had retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
(“Morgan Stanley”) as its financial advisor to assist the EGC board of directors and senior management with the
evaluation, development and implementation of a long-term strategic plan, including a stand-alone financial plan
and select strategic alternatives. EGC worked with Morgan Stanley on its strategic plan throughout 2017 and
evaluated a variety of alternatives, including mergers or consolidations, a stand-alone plan and capital infusion
options. While EGC received a reasonable level of interest from potential counterparties, particularly discussions
of Gulf of Mexico Shelf consolidation, no executable transaction resulted from this review process.

After the conclusion of the Morgan Stanley strategic review process in late 2017, the EGC board of directors
and management team shifted EGC’s near-term focus to the development of an optimized stand-alone strategy
and multi-year plan. EGC announced in November 2017 that it would return to drilling in 2018, and would focus
on optimizing and enhancing its existing production with an active drilling, recompletion and workover program,
evaluating acquisitions, exploring potential dispositions of non-core properties, and continuing to control costs.
However, throughout the first quarter of 2018, EGC experienced production declines primarily due to disruptions
associated with shut-ins from severe weather, production equipment maintenance issues, pipeline shut-ins,
facility-related unscheduled downtime and natural declines. The cumulative effect of these operational difficulties
served to reduce EGC’s liquidity and its ability to raise external capital.

As a complement to EGC’s stand-alone capital plan, EGC retained Intrepid in January 2018 to assist EGC
with the consideration of possible opportunities for raising additional capital. In addition to their work with
Intrepid, the EGC board of directors and senior management:

• continued to encourage opportunities with potential counterparties to permit EGC to increase its
drilling activity, including potential “drillco” joint ventures and farm-out arrangements;

• continued to consider the divestiture of certain of EGC’s non-core oil and gas properties; and

• engaged Alvarez & Marsal North America, LLC to help EGC find and exploit greater efficiencies and
cost savings.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In late 2017, as part of its review of all strategic alternatives, EGC considered a potential divestiture of its
western GoM assets, consisting of properties that had significant near-term asset retirement obligations (“ARO”)
and limited cash flow and development upside. Given the unique nature of the western GoM assets, EGC ran a
trial sale process as a test case, focusing on a small subset of companies that had either in-house plugging and
abandonment operations or access to plugging and abandonment services through contractual arrangements or
affiliates. This targeted process did not produce an executable transaction, and the general feedback from the
targeted potential purchasers was that the proposed asset package did not have enough production potential to
support the ARO.

In late January 2018, as part of EGC’s trial western GoM divesture process, representatives of EGC met
with representatives of Northstar Offshore Ventures LLC (“Northstar”), an affiliate of Orinoco Natural
Resources, LLC (“ONR”). During that meeting, the Northstar representatives suggested that Doug Brooks,
EGC’s chief executive officer, meet with Tom Clarke, one of the owners of Northstar and ONR. The Northstar
representatives believed that Mr. Clarke might have some ideas for making attractive to both EGC and the
counterparty the transfer of properties with large amounts of ARO (i.e., where the ARO attributable to a property
is greater than or disproportionate to the value of that property’s remaining reserves) (such a transaction, an
“ARO transfer transaction”).

After the meeting between Northstar and EGC, Mr. Clarke reached out to Mr. Brooks to set up a meeting,
and on January 30, 2018, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Clarke, Scott Laverde, an EGC business development representative,
and representatives of Northstar met at EGC’s offices to discuss how a potential ARO transfer transaction with
EGC might work. A few days after that meeting, on February 1, 2018, Mr. Clarke emailed a letter to Mr. Brooks,
reiterating Mr. Clarke’s desire to structure an ARO transfer transaction that would enable EGC to transfer its
western GoM assets and their associated ARO. He acknowledged that any such transaction would need to be
structured so that the buyer was able to “self perform” the plugging and abandonment necessary to service the
ARO. In order to make the buyer entity more self-sustaining, Mr. Clarke proposed that EGC enter into a multi-
year plugging and abandonment services agreement with the buyer. He also noted his willingness to invest in
EGC’s upcoming capital raise efforts.

On February 20, 2018, Mr. Clarke and additional ONR representatives met with representatives from
Intrepid at Intrepid’s offices to discuss structuring a potential ARO transfer transaction involving EGC’s western
GoM assets. The participants in the meeting acknowledged that the buyer entity would need to be a stand-alone
entity with access to cash flows in order to ensure that EGC would not have any successor liability with respect to
the assumed ARO. Following that meeting, on February 22, 2018, Mr. Clarke emailed Intrepid a letter that
described a high-level proposed structure for a potential ARO transfer transaction. Consistent with his prior
conversations with Intrepid, he proposed forming a separate “environmental fund” entity, supported financially
by ONR. In consideration for ONR’s ARO liability assumption, EGC would enter into a long-term plugging and
abandonment services agreement with EPIC Offshore Specialty, LLC (“EPIC”), an ONR affiliate. Mr. Brooks
forwarded this letter to the EGC board of directors on February 22, 2018. On March 5, 2018, representatives from
ONR (including Mr. Clarke), EGC (including Mr. Brooks) and Intrepid met at EGC’s offices to further discuss
structuring options for an ARO transfer transaction. Around this time, ONR and EGC began negotiating a more
expansive confidentiality agreement, because the previous confidentiality agreements that ONR had executed
with EGC did not provide for discussions with ONR affiliates like EPIC. That confidentiality agreement was
executed by EGC, ONR and certain ONR affiliates on March 12, 2018. On March 14, 2018, EGC gave ONR
access to EGC’s electronic dataroom.

On February 7, 2018, Scott Heck, EGC’s chief operating officer, attended an energy conference event in
Houston hosted by Houlihan Lokey, Inc. (“Houlihan”). At that event, a Houlihan representative told Mr. Heck
that he knew of a strategic opportunity that EGC might be interested in. He proposed that

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Mr. Heck and Mr. Brooks meet him for lunch to discuss further. On February 21, 2018, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Heck
met for lunch with the Houlihan representative, as well another Houlihan colleague. During the course of this
meeting, the Houlihan representatives indicated that Cox thought favorably of EGC’s core assets and asked
Mr. Brooks and Mr. Heck whether they would be willing to meet with representatives from Cox to discuss the
possibility of a transaction between the two companies.

On March 7, 2018, a dinner meeting was held that included Mr. Brooks, Mr. Heck, Craig Sanders (Cox’s
chief executive officer), Brad Cox (Cox’s chairman), Ken Jackson (Cox’s chief financial officer), and
representatives from Houlihan. At this dinner, the parties discussed the possibility of a potential transaction
between EGC and Cox. Mr. Brooks indicated that he was open to the idea of discussing a potential combination.
He told the Cox representatives that if they were interested in pursuing the matter further, they should provide a
more formal expression of their interest that he could discuss with the EGC board of directors. Mr. Brooks
informed EGC’s then-serving chairman of the board, Michael Reddin, about these discussions.

On March 9, 2018, Mr. Sanders sent a written expression of interest by email to Mr. Reddin, copying
Mr. Brooks and Mr. Heck. Cox’s expression of interest contemplated the purchase by Cox Operating, L.L.C. and
its affiliates (all of which are Cox affiliates, and for purposes of this section, the defined term “Cox” includes all
of those entities) of  “all or part of” EGC’s assets (but did not include any pricing or valuation terms), and asked
EGC for 120 days of exclusivity to permit Cox to conduct its due diligence review of EGC. Mr. Reddin replied to
Mr. Sanders’ email that same day, informing Mr. Sanders that EGC was open to discussions with Cox regarding a
combination. He also noted that he had passed along Cox’s letter to the EGC board of directors and that the EGC
board of directors would discuss it at its upcoming meeting. He indicated that Mr. Brooks would reach out to
Mr. Sanders after that board meeting to discuss the potential path forward.

On March 13, 2018, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the EGC board of directors, the EGC management
team updated the EGC board of directors on the discussions with ONR and the March 9, 2018 expression of
interest from Cox. The EGC board of directors encouraged management to continue pursuing both the proposed
ONR transaction and the proposed Cox transaction, and agreed that EGC should not grant exclusivity to Cox at
that time.

On March 15, 2018, Mr. Brooks sent an email to Mr. Sanders in response to Cox’s March 9, 2018 expression
of interest, stating that EGC was not willing to grant Cox exclusivity, but that EGC was interested in continuing
to have discussions with Cox regarding a corporate level transaction or a transaction for all of EGC’s assets. To
facilitate those discussions, Mr. Brooks suggested that Cox and EGC enter into a mutual confidentiality
agreement.

On March 19, 2018, EGC sent Mr. Sanders a formal written response to Cox’s March 9, 2018 expression of
interest, reiterating the points from Mr. Brooks’ March 15, 2018 email to Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders replied that
Cox was willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with EGC. EGC and Cox finalized and executed that
confidentiality agreement on March 22, 2018, and Cox was given access to EGC’s electronic data room on
March 27, 2018. EGC and Cox continued to communicate regarding Cox’s diligence review throughout
April 2018.

At a meeting of the EGC board of directors held on March 29, 2018, EGC management updated the board
on the status of EGC’s strategic initiatives, including potential transactions with ONR and Cox. Also at that
meeting, Gary Hanna was appointed to the EGC board of directors and was named chairman of the board.

On April 2, 2018, EGC announced that it had named Gary Hanna chairman of the board. Shortly after that
announcement, on April 6, 2018, one of Party B’s senior executives sent Mr. Hanna an email, indicating his
willingness to provide offshore oilfield services to EGC. Party B had previously participated in EGC’s trial
western divesture process that ONR’s affiliate had participated in, and had previously indicated to EGC in
February 2018 that it was not interested in purchasing EGC’s western GoM assets. The senior Party B executive’s
April 6, 2018 email also mentioned the possibility of combining EGC with Party B, a privately held company
with a primary focus on offshore oilfield services. However, the clear

TABLE OF CONTENTS

implication of the email was that any transaction like that would involve some sort of equity for equity
transaction. During the course of the discussion described below between EGC and Party B, Party B never again
raised the possibility of any sort of business combination.

On April 12, 2018, representatives from Intrepid called Mr. Brooks and told him that one of EGC’s
stockholders had mentioned to Intrepid that Party B might be interested in acquiring EGC’s western GoM assets.
However, because Party B had previously indicated to EGC that it was not interested in purchasing those assets,
EGC did not re-engage with Party B at that time.

Mr. Hanna replied to the April 6 email from the Party B senior executive on April 20, 2018, thanking the
executive for his interest and confirming that he would discuss Party B’s interest in providing offshore oilfield
services with EGC management. Those discussions did not go any further at that time.

EGC, ONR and Intrepid continued to meet and hold discussions throughout April 2018 regarding potential
ways to structure an ARO transfer transaction involving EGC’s non-core assets. EGC and Intrepid continued to
focus on ensuring that ONR’s post-closing structure would be financially sound and have the ability to operate on
a stand-alone basis, to reduce the risk of any of the ARO reverting to EGC. The parties also discussed valuation
considerations at length, including the forms of potential consideration that ONR and its affiliates could receive
in exchange for assuming the non-core assets’ ARO liability. They also discussed ONR’s bonding capabilities.
The value proposition to EGC of a potential ARO transfer transaction was not based solely on decreasing EGC’s
ARO, but also depended on the release of cash collateral held by EGC’s sureties, which would in turn serve to
increase EGC’s liquidity. As a result, EGC stressed the importance of ONR being able to fully perform all
bonding requirements with respect to the non-core assets. In one such meeting at EGC’s offices on April 20,
2018, with representatives from EGC, ONR, Intrepid and Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley”), EGC’s outside M&A
counsel, participating by phone or in person, EGC provided ONR with an initial draft of a term sheet,
representing EGC’s proposal on transaction structure.

During the remainder of April 2018, the proposed term sheet went through several drafts, and EGC, ONR
and Intrepid discussed the document on several occasions. These discussions were intended to address, among
other issues, the parties’ differing valuations of the various components of the potential ARO transaction,
including with respect to the margins under the long-term plugging and abandonment services agreement and the
value of the other consideration payable to ONR and its affiliates in consideration for ONR’s assumption of
ARO.

On April 29, 2018, the EGC board of directors held a special meeting, which also included certain members
of EGC senior management and representatives from Intrepid and Sidley. At the meeting, EGC management
walked the EGC board of directors through EGC’s current forecast and noted the operational challenges faced by
EGC in the first quarter of 2018. The EGC board of directors and Intrepid discussed the implications of EGC’s
maintaining the status quo, including the impact of the continued production downtime on EGC’s debt covenants
and cash collateral requirements following the planned May 10, 2018 release of first quarter results. Intrepid
indicated that current market sentiment was that EGC needed a capital and liability solution and that investors
and other stakeholders were concerned about EGC’s ARO burden relative to cash flow and production. Intrepid
then updated the EGC board of directors on the status of the term sheet negotiations with ONR. Sidley informed
the EGC board of directors that the term sheet did not contain exclusivity provisions and would permit EGC to
terminate the term sheet so long as EGC paid ONR’s reasonable transaction expenses up to $1,000,000. Intrepid
presented the EGC board of directors with certain information about ONR and its affiliates and led a detailed
discussion of the currently contemplated terms of the proposed ARO transfer transaction with ONR and the
potential benefits of the proposed ONR transaction, including partially addressing EGC’s ARO liabilities and
improving the likelihood of a third-party financing transaction. At the conclusion of these discussions, the EGC
board of directors decided that it would take the proposed transaction and its terms under advisement and would
re-convene on May 1, 2018 to discuss the matter further.

On May 1, 2018, the EGC board of directors held a special meeting, which also included certain members of
EGC senior management and representatives from Intrepid and Sidley. Discussions regarding the term sheet with
ONR resumed, and in the course of those discussions, a representative from Sidley walked the EGC board of
directors through the remaining open issues in the ONR term sheet. The EGC

• EGC would transfer its non-core oil and gas assets to an ONR affiliate and that affiliate would assume
all related liabilities, including ARO;

• in consideration for that assumption, EGC would

• provide a $100,000,000 second lien note to an ONR affiliate, to be amortized ratably beginning
2019 and bearing interest at 9% per annum;

• pay an ONR affiliate cash equal to $12,500,000 at closing;

• to the extent EGC’s existing surety bond providers release a certain portion of cash collateral, pay
ONR or its affiliate an additional cash amount six months after closing equal to $12,500,000 or the
amount of cash collateral released, whichever was less;

• issue to ONR a 35% equity ownership position in EGC, pro forma after giving effect to the
transaction; and

• sign a 10-year agreement with EPIC to provide plugging and abandonment and decommissioning
services for EGC’s core assets; and

• ONR and/or its affiliates would commit at closing to anchor a potential future EGC financing with at
least a $25,000,000 participation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

board of directors then discussed the terms of the proposed plugging and abandonment services agreement with
EPIC, and EGC management walked the EGC board of directors through an overview of EPIC, its capabilities,
and the key terms. After further discussion, the EGC board of directors authorized EGC’s management to enter
into a non-binding term sheet with ONR with respect to the proposed ARO transfer transaction, subject to
approval of the resolution of the open items by Mr. Hanna, acting as the sole member of an ad hoc committee of
the EGC board of directors established for that purpose.

On May 2, 2018, EGC, ONR and certain ONR affiliates (including EPIC) executed a non-binding term
sheet, which did not include any exclusivity provisions. The ARO transfer transaction contemplated by that term
sheet (the “Proposed ONR Transaction”) principally consisted of the following:

The term sheet with ONR provided that the Proposed ONR Transaction would be subject to approval by
EGC’s stockholders, lenders, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”). EGC then instructed Sidley to begin drafting definitive documentation
for the Proposed ONR Transaction.

On May 1, 2018, shortly after the adjournment of the special meeting of the EGC board of directors,
Mr. Sanders emailed Mr. Brooks a written, non-binding indicative proposal (the “May 1 Cox Proposal”), to
acquire all outstanding EGC common stock for cash, at a 15% premium to EGC’s equity market value as of
April 30, 2018 (which the proposal stated was $6.55 per share). This proposal was non-binding and subject to
resolution of several due diligence items. It also noted that Cox was fully financed and that its proposed
transaction would not be subject to any financing contingency. The May 1 Cox Proposal also included a request
that EGC grant Cox exclusivity through June 30, 2018. On the same day Cox sent the proposal, Mr. Brooks
replied to Mr. Sanders, indicating that he had received the proposal and would review it with the EGC board of
directors. The following day, on May 2, 2018, Mr. Brooks provided an email update to the EGC directors
regarding this proposal.

On May 7, 2018, following email communications with the EGC board of directors supporting this course of
action, Mr. Brooks sent an email to Mr. Sanders in response to the May 1 Cox Proposal, indicating that EGC was
still not willing to grant Cox exclusivity. However, Mr. Brooks stated that EGC was open to continuing
discussions regarding a potential transaction with Cox and would continue providing due diligence items.

On May 9, 2018, the EGC board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting, which also included certain
members of EGC senior management and representatives from Intrepid. EGC management reminded the EGC
board of directors that the term sheet for the Proposed ONR Transaction did not contain an exclusivity provision
and therefore would not preclude EGC from continuing to explore additional strategic alternatives. After
discussion, it was the consensus of the board that EGC management should continue discussions with Cox.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Early in the morning of May 10, 2018, EGC announced its first quarter 2018 financial and operational
results. EGC also announced the execution of the non-binding ONR term sheet because it was a key component
of EGC’s financing initiative that was disclosed in the May 10, 2018 press release and in EGC’s quarterly report
on Form 10-Q filed that day with the SEC. Also on May 10, 2018, representatives of EGC had an initial meeting
with representatives of BOEM and BSEE to discuss the Proposed ONR Transaction. Later that day, Mr. Brooks
also held a separate telephone conversation with BOEM and BSEE regarding the Proposed ONR Transaction.

Also on May 10, 2018, in response to the announcement of the Proposed ONR Transaction, Party B’s chief
operating officer emailed Mr. Hanna and Mr. Brooks, indicating that Party B could make a “much better offer”
for EGC’s non-core assets than the transaction that EGC had announced earlier that day, including providing
substantially more post-closing capital to fund EGC’s development program. Mr. Brooks responded on May 11,
2018, offering to meet with Party B the following week to discuss Party B’s proposal in more detail.

On May 11, 2018, in response to the announcement of the Proposed ONR Transaction, Mr. Sanders emailed
Mr. Brooks a letter reaffirming Cox’s commitment to proceed with an acquisition of EGC, as outlined in the
May 1 Cox Proposal and requesting additional diligence items. On May 15, 2018, Mr. Hanna and Mr. Cox had a
call to discuss the terms of the May 1 Cox Proposal and potential next steps. Mr. Hanna encouraged Mr. Cox to
provide a more comprehensive proposal that described the specific transaction terms for the EGC board of
directors to consider. He also asked Mr. Cox to provide additional information about Cox’s financing plan for the
transaction, including financial statements for the Cox corporate family.

Also on May 11, 2018, Sidley sent ONR and its counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”), an initial draft
of the purchase agreement for the Proposed ONR Transaction. Sidley continued to send drafts of various ancillary
documents throughout that week.

On May 14, 2018, Party B’s chief financial officer called a representative of Intrepid to discuss the
possibility of Party B pursuing a transaction with EGC similar to the Proposed ONR Transaction, and informing
Intrepid that Party B would be sending a proposal to EGC shortly. The following day, on May 15, 2018, Party B’s
chief financial officer emailed Intrepid a high-level proposal for an ARO transfer transaction on terms very
similar to the terms that had been publicly disclosed with respect to the Proposed ONR Transaction (the
“Proposed Party B Transaction”). However, instead of the 35% pro forma common stock ownership
contemplated by the Proposed ONR Transaction, Party B proposed to receive instead a 19.99% common stock
ownership position in EGC, pro forma for the transaction, with warrants giving Party B a right to purchase
another 5% equity ownership position in EGC. Furthermore, Party B indicated that Party B would commit to
anchor a potential future EGC financing with up to $35 million participation, with a financial partner potentially
committing an additional $50 million participation for a possible total of  $85 million participation.

On May 17, 2018, at a joint meeting of the EGC board of directors and its nomination and governance
committee attended by certain representatives of EGC management and Sidley, EGC management updated the
directors on the status of the strategic alternatives being pursued by EGC, including the May 15, 2018 proposal
from Party B. The EGC board of directors discussed Party B and its capabilities and the terms of its proposal (and
the key differences between Party B’s proposal and the terms of the Proposed ONR Transaction). EGC
management then informed the EGC board of directors of initial feedback received from key stakeholders in
reaction to the May 10, 2018 announcement of the Proposed ONR Transaction, noting that concerns were
expressed about the complexity of the transaction and the amount of equity being issued to ONR. EGC
management then reiterated that EGC’s non-binding term sheet with ONR did not prohibit EGC from further
discussions with Party B. It was the consensus of the EGC board of directors that EGC’s management should
continue to pursue a transaction with Party B on a parallel basis with the Proposed ONR Transaction.

Later on May 17, 2018, representatives of EGC (including Mr. Brooks) and Intrepid had a call with Party
B’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer to discuss Party B’s May 15, 2018 proposal. The Party B
representatives indicated that, through Party B’s involvement in the trial divesture process for

EGC’s western GoM assets earlier that year, it had already completed significant diligence and therefore the Party
B representatives were confident they could move forward on an expedited basis. Mr. Brooks forwarded Party
B’s expression of interest to the EGC board of directors on May 18, 2018, along with a summary of his call with
Party B’s representatives.

Also on May 17, 2018, Mr. Brooks and representatives from Intrepid called Mr. Sanders and certain
representatives from Houlihan, and asked for a more detailed proposal with a financing plan. They noted that
EGC was continuing to actively pursue other strategic opportunities, some of which were progressing very
quickly.

On May 18, 2018, prior to a scheduled call between Mr. Hanna and Mr. Cox, Mr. Sanders sent Mr. Hanna an
email that described the issues that Cox believed were hindering the progress of a transaction between EGC and
Cox. These points were primarily focused on the flow of due diligence information and Cox’s perception that
EGC’s management was spending time finalizing the Proposed ONR Transaction, that, in Cox’s view, presented
significant execution risk (presumably in comparison with Cox’s proposed transaction) and was generally inferior
to the transaction proposed by Cox. The communication went on to re-confirm the May 1 Cox Proposal,
clarifying that Cox’s proposed 15% premium would apply to EGC’s current stock price on a “rolling basis,”
which EGC understood to mean that Cox’s proposed acquisition price would increase or decrease until signing of
a definitive merger agreement as EGC’s stock price increased or decreased, so that a 15% premium would be in
effect at signing.

Mr. Hanna promptly forwarded this communication to Mr. Brooks. Mr. Hanna then discussed the email with
Mr. Cox by phone. Both men agreed that they should maintain open and direct lines of communication between
Cox and EGC so that progress could be made in Cox’s diligence and in the parties’ discussions. Mr. Hanna again
urged Mr. Cox to provide a more comprehensive proposal with specific transaction terms for consideration by
EGC management and the EGC board of directors. They then discussed the details of Cox’s proposal, particularly
the level of the proposed merger consideration. Mr. Hanna noted that Cox should be able to take advantage of
synergies and execute considerable cost reductions in an acquisition of EGC, and he encouraged Mr. Cox to take
these factors into account and to increase Cox’s proposed merger consideration by a meaningful amount.

On May 24, 2018, Party B sent an updated proposal to EGC, reaffirming the terms of its prior proposal, and
including certain materials regarding Party B’s operational and financial ability to execute an ARO transfer
transaction. On the same day, EGC and Party B executed a confidentiality agreement, and on May 29, 2018, EGC
granted Party B electronic data room access.

Also on May 24, 2018, representatives from Cox, EGC and Intrepid participated in a due diligence meeting
at EGC’s offices. One week later, on May 31, 2018, Mr. Sanders emailed Mr. Brooks another letter reconfirming
Cox’s interest in pursuing a transaction with EGC on the terms set forth in the May 1 Cox Proposal, including at a
15% premium to EGC’s current stock price (as of May 31, 2018, this implied proposed merger consideration of
approximately $8.15 per share). On that same day, a representative from Intrepid called a representative at
Houlihan to discuss process and timing. He urged Cox to submit a more comprehensive proposal, ideally a fully
drafted merger agreement, and a detailed financing plan, prior to the scheduled June 7 meeting of the EGC board
of directors. He noted that those actions were necessary if Cox was to remain competitive with EGC’s other
strategic alternatives and meet the EGC board of directors’ timeline.

On May 25, 2018, Mr. Brooks updated the EGC board of directors on the Proposed ONR Transaction. He
reported that ONR and EGC were actively engaging to finalize the definitive documentation, and that EGC had a
meeting scheduled to discuss key business issues on May 30, 2018, with ONR and Latham. Mr. Brooks also
forwarded the May 24, 2018 proposal received from Party B to the EGC board of directors.

On June 5, 2018, the Houlihan and Intrepid representatives spoke again regarding the potential transation
between Cox and EGC. During that call, Intrepid communicated to Houlihan that time was of the essence and
that EGC’s current thinking was that it was very likely that Friday, June 15 was the date that the EGC Board
would choose which transaction to pursue, with definitive documents executed either that day or over the
weekend followed by a public announcement no later than Monday, June 18.

• understanding and agreeing on ONR’s post-closing structure and establishing the appropriate anti-
leakage controls, to help ensure that EGC would have no successor liability for the transferred ARO,
while still permitting ONR to operating the buying entity as an independent, financeable stand-alone
enterprise;

• working through a potential unwind structure in the event BOEM and BSEE did not approve both the
property transfers and the replacements of surety bonds within a reasonable period of time after
closing; and

• continuing to work through issues related to replacement bonding, including whether ONR would need
to satisfy any increased surety bond requirements imposed by applicable counterparties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also on June 5, 2018, representatives from Party B, EGC and Intrepid met at EGC to discuss Party B’s
May 24, 2018 proposal in more detail. During the course of those discussions, Party B indicated that its intent
was to structure the Proposed Party B Transaction so that no EGC stockholder vote would be required under
NASDAQ’s stockholder approval rules. Therefore, Party B clarified that it was proposing to receive (i) 19.99%
of the shares of EGC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to closing and (ii) warrants with a
strike price greater than EGC common stock’s fair market value that would be excluded under NASDAQ’s
stockholder approval guidelines. Taking these qualifying warrants into account, Party B would have pro forma
economic upside exposure equivalent to 25% of EGC common stock. After that meeting, Ms. Marguerite Woung-
Chapman, EGC’s senior vice president and general counsel, sent Party B drafts of key definitive documents for
its review.

Throughout May and early June 2018 (including the week of June 11, 2018), EGC management and its legal
and financial advisors continued to engage in negotiations with ONR and Latham, including several in-person
negotiations, and exchanged several definitive document drafts. Near the end of May 2018, the outstanding key
business issues primarily consisted of:

On June 6, 2018, Sidley sent the ONR working team a revised draft of the plugging and abandonment
services agreement, as well as a revised draft of the second lien note agreement. In response to those
distributions, a representative of one of ONR’s affiliates sent an email to the EGC and ONR working teams late
that night, expressing his concern that the transaction documents were no longer consistent with the non-binding
term sheet for the Proposed ONR Transaction. He stated in the email that ONR would terminate the term sheet if
acceptable definitive documents were not signed within two days.

On June 7, 2018, Mr. Brooks called the ONR representative to discuss ONR’s concerns. They agreed that
the parties and their respective advisors would meet the next day. Accordingly, on June 8, 2018, EGC and ONR,
together with Sidley and Latham, met at EGC’s offices to discuss the open issues, primarily focused on the
plugging and abandonment services agreement. At that meeting, ONR also indicated that it would be willing to
consider a structure in which its 35% pro forma equity position consisted of 19.99% of the outstanding EGC
common stock, with the remainder of the 35% exposure to upside composed of warrants that would not be
counted in determining whether a stockholder vote is required under NASDAQ’s stockholder approval
guidelines. At the conclusion of that meeting, several issues still remained open between EGC and ONR.

On June 7, 2018, Mr. Sanders emailed Mr. Brooks a letter reconfirming Cox’s interest in pursuing a
transaction with EGC on the terms set forth in the May 1 Cox Proposal and setting forth certain final diligence
items that Cox needed resolved. The June 7 letter included an attached draft letter agreement and term sheet,
setting forth Cox’s proposed terms for the transaction. Cox’s draft letter agreement included a request for
exclusivity and did not include Cox’s proposal on a definitive amount of merger consideration or termination fee.
Shortly after Mr. Sanders sent this letter to Mr. Brooks, Mr. Sanders forwarded the letter to Mr. Hanna and
Mr. Cox. The two Cox representatives then had a call with Mr. Hanna to discuss this updated proposal, including
the draft letter agreement and term sheet. Mr. Hanna noted that he was encouraged by the progress, but reiterated
to Mr. Cox and Mr. Sanders that the EGC board of directors expected to see upward movement in the merger
consideration and wanted more detail around Cox’s financing plan. Mr. Hanna explained that certainty of closing
was very important to the EGC board of directors and that EGC’s directors were concerned about the lack of
visibility into Cox’s financing, particularly in light of the fact that Cox’s financial statements show Cox’s
liquidity to be a small percentage

• merger consideration of  $9.25 per share in cash;

• additional merger consideration in the form of a contingent value right that would potentially increase
the per share consideration by $0.75 per share, based on achieving certain oil price thresholds;

• a termination fee equal to 3% of the total equity value implied by the transaction (approximately
$9,800,000), payable under customary circumstances relating to any EGC change of recommendation
or acceptance of a superior proposal;

• execution of definitive documentation by June 15, 2018; and

• a credible financing plan.

• merger consideration of  $9.00 per share in cash;

of the total merger consideration. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Cox reminded Mr. Hanna that Cox was working diligently
with Houlihan and that it was their view that — given Cox’s lack of leverage and strong capital base — financing
would not be a hindrance to closing the transaction.

On June 7, 2018, the EGC board of directors held a special meeting, which also included certain members of
EGC senior management and representatives from Intrepid and Sidley. EGC management updated the board on
the progress being made with each of Cox, ONR and Party B in their respective negotiations, acknowledged they
were each likely exclusive of the other, and discussed the risks associated with each transaction (including
certainty of closing and relative complexity), as well as the stockholder vote required for each transaction (if
any). During the course of that meeting, the directors discussed and considered a net asset value analysis of
EGC’s stand-alone plan (that is, without giving effect to any of the proposed strategic transactions) that had been
prepared by Intrepid based on assumptions provided by EGC’s management and to reflect an aggressive pricing
structure to reflect an optimistic sell-side perspective. That net asset value analysis, which was prepared solely for
this purpose and not as a valuation used by Intrepid for any other purpose, suggested a stand-alone value of EGC
of approximately $9.25 per share. The EGC board of directors acknowledged the challenge — given the financial
analyses presented to the board for consideration — of executing a successful capital raise after closing the
Proposed ONR Transaction or Proposed Party B Transaction. The board also acknowledged that such a financing
would be necessary for EGC to continue to succeed on a stand-alone basis. After much discussion, the EGC
board of directors authorized EGC management to respond to the letter sent by Cox earlier that day by making a
counterproposal to Cox of  $9.25 per fully diluted share and a termination fee equal to 3% of the total equity
value implied by the transaction. Furthermore, the EGC board of directors encouraged management, Intrepid and
Sidley to continue pursuing all strategic paths.

After the meeting, Mr. Brooks sent Mr. Sanders an email with a short letter responding to Cox’s letter from
earlier that day. The letter stated that because of EGC’s continued pursuit of certain strategic alternatives,
including the previously announced Proposed ONR Transaction, as well as the advanced stage of the negotiations
and documentation of the Proposed ONR Transaction, EGC would be unwilling to agree to proceed exclusively
with Cox without Cox agreeing to the following:

On the morning of June 8, 2018, representatives of Cox, EGC and Intrepid participated in a previously
scheduled diligence meeting. At that meeting, they addressed the open diligence items noted in Cox’s June 7
letter. As that meeting was wrapping up, EGC instructed Sidley to start drafting a merger agreement for
distribution to Cox and its counsel.

Also on June 8, 2018, Intrepid called Party B’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer to inform
them that the EGC board of directors was supportive of EGC’s continued discussions and negotiations with Party
B, and to inform them that EGC wanted to sign and announce a transaction by the end of the following week. The
Party B representatives indicated that they were committed to working with EGC to meet the EGC board of
directors’ timeline.

Later that day, Mr. Sanders emailed a letter to Mr. Brooks, reflecting Cox’s counterproposal to EGC’s
June 7, 2018 letter. Cox’s revised proposal provided for:

• additional merger consideration in the form of a contingent value right based on oil price variability
(essentially the amount would increase if oil was over $72.00 a barrel, and would decrease if it dipped
below $61.00 a barrel, and the maximum amount payable by Cox would be $1.00 per share);

• a termination fee equal to 2.5% of the total equity value implied by the transaction (approximately
$7,950,000), payable under the circumstances noted in EGC’s proposal; and

• signing definitive documents by June 15, 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Mr. Brooks and Mr. Sanders had a call on June 9, 2018 to discuss these proposals and counterproposals.
Mr. Brooks impressed upon Mr. Sanders that EGC and the EGC board of directors needed to understand Cox’s
financing plan in order to get comfortable, and that the non-contingent portion of the merger consideration
needed to be higher and Cox agreed to $9.10 per share in cash. Later that morning, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Sanders
had further discussions on valuation, and Mr. Sanders proposed to increase the merger consideration to $9.10 per
share, plus the contingent value right discussed in Cox’s June 8 letter, subject to EGC’s agreement to the
transaction fee as proposed by Cox on June 8. Mr. Sanders reiterated that Cox’s financing plan was in process and
it did not anticipate any hindrance to obtaining financing given its strong financial position.

Also on June 9, 2018, representatives of Sidley and Locke Lord LLP (“Locke Lord”), Cox’s outside counsel,
had an introductory call to generally discuss transaction structure and the draft merger agreement that Sidley
planned to send the following day. In addition to general introductions and logistics, the parties discussed the
contingent value right component of the proposed transaction and how that might be structured. The Locke Lord
representatives told Sidley that it was their understanding from their client that Cox and EGC would ultimately
agree to a fixed cash per share number, without any additional contingent value right. The Sidley and Locke Lord
representatives agreed that the contingent value right would create securities law and derivatives law issues that
would need to be addressed. Sidley also inquired as to the status of Cox’s financing efforts, including whether
Cox would have fully committed financing in place at signing. Locke Lord replied that, while the transaction
would not be subject to any financing contingency, Cox would not have fully committed financing in place at
signing, in part because Cox had not yet decided the optimal equity-debt capital structure for the transaction.

On the afternoon of Sunday, June 10, 2018, Sidley delivered an initial draft of the merger agreement to
Locke Lord. The Sidley draft contemplated that Cox would have fully committed financing in place at signing.
Mr. Brooks promptly reported these counteroffers to Mr. Hanna, Intrepid and Sidley.

On the evening of June 11, 2018, Sidley circulated to the ONR working team a term sheet that described a
proposed clawback mechanism for addressing the situation where BOEM did not approve a certain level of the
proposed asset transfers within six months after the closing of the Proposed ONR Transaction. Shortly after that
distribution, Ms. Woung-Chapman circulated the same term sheet to the Party B working team, modified to
reflect the differences between the two proposed transactions.

During the week of June 11, 2018, the EGC working team and the Party B working team exchanged drafts
on several of the key definitive document drafts and had several calls to discuss those drafts, including a call to
discuss open items on the purchase agreement shortly before the scheduled June 15, 2018 meeting of the EGC
board of directors. As a result of those document exchanges and negotiations, significant progress was made
toward finalizing documentation with Party B.

Locke Lord sent Sidley a revised draft of the Cox merger agreement on June 12, 2018, and Sidley
immediately distributed the draft to EGC’s management team. Locke Lord’s revised draft removed all references
to committed financing but kept the representation in the merger agreement that Cox will have sufficient funds to
pay the merger consideration at closing. On June 13, 2018, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Cox discussed
certain key open issues with regard to the merger and its documentation, primarily related to Cox’s financing plan
and the merger consideration. Mr. Hanna encouraged Mr. Sanders and Mr. Cox to increase the fixed merger
consideration in lieu of offering the contingent value right, due to the complication and uncertainty created by
that feature, and reiterated the need to see a cohesive plan regarding Cox’s financing of the transaction. With
respect to the financing issues, Mr. Sanders reiterated his view that financing would not be a hindrance, given
Cox’s robust financial strength.

• EGC’s remedies in the event of a termination of the merger agreement due to Cox’s breach (this
became a concern for EGC and its counsel once Cox made clear that it would not seek to have
committed in financing in place at signing of the merger agreement, which in turn made EGC less
comfortable with accepting specific performance as its only remedy in such a situation);

• instances in which Cox would be entitled to a termination payment from EGC;

• the deletion of covenants protective to EGC’s employees; and

• some relatively minor points on EGC’s representations and warranties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On June 12, 2018, EGC and ONR, together with Sidley and Latham, met in EGC’s office to discuss the
second lien note agreement and other ancillary documents for the Proposed ONR Transaction. On June 13, 2018,
EGC and ONR, together with Sidley and Latham, re-convened in EGC’s office to discuss the ONR purchase and
sale agreement. During that meeting, ONR informed EGC that the current post-closing structure of the ONR
affiliate assuming the ARO liability would not be financeable and had to be changed to permit ONR to obtain the
financing needed to operate that entity on a stand-alone basis post-closing. To that end, ONR indicated that
EGC’s non-core assets should be held by Northstar instead of a separate entity that was insulated from
Northstar’s debt and other liabilities. EGC indicated that it was willing to discuss potential solutions, but noted
internally that these changes — which impacted certain structural components in the transaction documentation,
including the anti-leakage protections — made it unlikely that the Proposed ONR Transaction would be in
executable form by the end of that week.

On June 14, 2018, Latham distributed to the EGC working team revised drafts of the purchase and sale
agreement and the plugging and abandonment services agreement.

Sidley sent a revised draft of the Cox merger agreement to Locke Lord early in the morning of June 14,
2018, reflecting the EGC management team’s response to the issues raised in Locke Lord’s initial response draft.
Sidley’s draft reserved comment on the financing provisions in the merger agreement.

Later in the day on June 14, 2018, Mr. Sanders stated by email that Cox would not obtain financing
commitments at signing. To provide EGC more comfort regarding the closing risk, he offered to have Cox’s
holding company enter into the merger agreement. Also on June 14, 2018, through communications between
Sidley and Locke Lord, EGC became aware that Cox’s proposed merger consideration of  $9.10 per share, plus a
contingent value right, had been calculated based only on EGC’s currently outstanding shares when calculating
the proposed merger consideration and did not include the settlement of EGC RSUs. This misunderstanding
widened the gap between the parties’ relative positions on valuation, as it effectively dropped Cox’s fixed price
per share (excluding the contingent value right) to approximately $8.60 per share.

During the morning of June 15, 2018, Sidley and Locke Lord discussed the contingent value right, and
Sidley indicated that they were concerned that the securities and derivatives legal requirements would prevent the
parties from providing any sort of contingent value right to all of EGC’s stockholders, particularly non-high net
worth individuals. Locke Lord acknowledged that the contingent value right was problematic, as proposed. Later
that morning, Locke Lord sent Sidley a revised draft of the merger agreement, and Sidley immediately distributed
the draft to EGC’s management team. Sidley called Locke Lord immediately prior to the scheduled meeting of
the EGC board of directors on the afternoon of June 15, 2018 to discuss the remaining open items in the merger
agreement, primarily related to:

Also, prior to the June 15 meeting of the EGC board of directors, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Cox and
Mr. Sanders discussed Cox’s proposed merger consideration, in light of Cox’s misunderstanding as to the total
number of shares (including EGC RSUs) to receive consideration and the complications presented by the
contingent value right. During that discussion, Mr. Sanders proposed a fixed merger consideration of $9.10 per
share, payable to all outstanding shares and all settled EGC RSUs, and that they would proceed without the
contingent value right.

In the afternoon of June 15, 2018, the EGC board of directors held a special meeting, which also included
certain members of EGC senior management and representatives from Intrepid and Sidley. At this meeting,
Sidley gave a presentation to the board regarding its fiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of the
proposed Cox merger, Proposed ONR Transaction and Proposed Party B Transaction. EGC management then
summarized for the directors the status of each of the three strategic transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EGC management noted that the post-closing structural changes recently proposed by ONR would likely require
further negotiations (including among the various entities within the ONR corporate family) in order to reach an
agreeable solution. They noted that documentation with Party B had progressed relatively quickly and that EGC
and Party B could reach executable documents in a matter of days. With respect to Cox, EGC management
walked the EGC board of directors through progress made on the merger agreement and the outstanding issues.
These issues included the recent communication from Cox regarding its financing and the position EGC was
taking in response that it should be able to pursue actual damages in the event of a Cox breach, in addition to
specific performance. Intrepid then discussed with the EGC board of directors the financing risks associated with
each of the three transactions. With respect to the Proposed ONR Transaction and the Proposed Party B
Transaction, Intrepid indicated that there would need to be successful intercreditor negotiations with EGC’s first
lien lenders between signing and closing, and EGC would need external financing after the closing of either of
those transactions. With respect to the merger, Intrepid stated that Cox would likely need to obtain external
financing to pay the total merger consideration.

At the request of the EGC board of directors, Sidley explained how the deal protection provisions in the
merger agreement worked. The EGC board of directors discussed the three transactions with EGC management,
Intrepid and Sidley. The EGC board of directors ultimately concurred that the merger appeared to have the
highest likelihood for success with the lowest long-term business risk. The EGC board of directors then directed
EGC management to prioritize its negotiations with Cox over the negotiations with ONR and Party B.

During this board meeting, a Sidley representative stepped out to take a call with representatives from Locke
Lord. Locke Lord had discussed the remedies issue with Cox and Cox had indicated that it would be willing to
permit EGC to seek actual damages in the event of a Cox breach leading to a failure to close up to $7,500,000,
which was their approximation of the amount of the termination fee. The Sidley representative responded that the
termination fee was not the appropriate analogy to a damages cap, since a termination fee is typically not payable
in situations where a party is at fault. He indicated that he would pass Cox’s proposal on to the EGC board of
directors, but advised the Locke Lord representatives that the cap was too low. The Sidley representative returned
to the meeting after that call and updated the participants on this conversation.

During the morning of June 16, 2018, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Hanna had a discussion with Mr. Sanders and
Mr. Cox regarding EGC’s remedies in the event of a termination of the merger agreement due to Cox’s breach.
The EGC representatives noted that the proposed $7,500,000 cap on EGC’s actual damages in that situation was
not acceptable, and that the EGC board of directors required the damages amount to be meaningful. In response,
the Cox representatives reiterated their position that specific performance should be EGC’s sole remedy, but that
they would also be comfortable with the $7,500,000 cap. The parties remained at an impasse over this issue.
Sidley and Locke Lord discussed the same issue, and Sidley communicated to Locke Lord the position expressed
by Mr. Hanna and Mr. Brooks to the Cox representatives.

Later in the day on Saturday, June 16, 2018, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Cox and Mr. Sanders reached an
agreement on EGC’s remedies in the event of a Cox breach of the merger agreement. EGC’s understanding of
that agreement was that EGC would have a right of specific performance and a right to pursue up to $35,000,000
in actual damages. During the evening of June 16, 2018, Sidley distributed a revised draft of the merger
agreement to Locke Lord, reflecting EGC management’s and the EGC board of directors’ responses to the open
issues. During the afternoon of June 17, 2018, counsel for EGC and Cox participated in a phone call to discuss
final outstanding issues on the merger agreement. Locke Lord then circulated a further revised draft of the merger
agreement later that afternoon, prior to the scheduled meeting of the EGC board of directors. The primary open
issues presented by Locke Lord’s draft were (i) movement of the proposed outside date from October 31, 2018 to
November 15, 2018, (ii) changing the actual damages cap from $35,000,000 to $30,000,000 and (iii)
modification to certain provisions protective to employees, officers and directors of EGC regarding the waiver
and release of claims of liability and obligation arising from the merger agreement or merger.

Early in the evening of Sunday, June 17, 2018, the EGC board of directors held a telephonic board meeting,
which also included certain members of EGC’s senior management team and representatives from

• the merger consideration represented a premium of:

• approximately 21.5% to the $7.49 per share closing price of EGC common stock on June 15,
2018, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger agreement;

• approximately 22.5% to the $7.43 per share volume-weighted average trading price of EGC
common stock for the 30 trading days ended June 15, 2018, the last trading day before the public
announcement of the merger agreement; and

Intrepid and Sidley. EGC management updated the EGC board of directors on the status of the merger agreement
and the related ancillary documents. The management team indicated that all material issues had been resolved,
including the level of merger consideration, which was set at $9.10 per share, with the sole exception of the
amount of the damages cap in the event of a termination of the merger agreement due to a breach by Cox. A
representative from Sidley reviewed with the EGC board of directors the terms of the merger agreement that had
changed since the June 15th meeting of the EGC board of directors. Mr. Brooks then indicated to the EGC board
of directors that he had agreed, during the June 17 meeting, to a $35,000,000 cap with Mr. Sanders, in exchange
for moving the outside date out to November 15, 2018. This was acceptable to the EGC board of directors.
Intrepid then delivered to the EGC board of directors its oral opinion, confirmed by its delivery of a written
opinion dated as of the same date, that, as of the date of the opinion, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in Intrepid’s written
opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the EGC
stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox). Following these discussions, the EGC board of
directors adopted the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger, were advisable and in the best interests of EGC and its stockholders
and the members present, representing all of the directors of EGC, unanimously voted to approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

After the conclusion of the June 17 meeting of the EGC board of directors, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Sanders had
two discussions, one with counsel for both parties participating, regarding the treatment of EGC’s severance plan
and setting up a special retention pool for EGC’s non-executive employees, to encourage retention and business
preservation between signing and closing. In the late evening of June 17, 2018, Sidley circulated a proposed
execution version of the merger agreement to Locke Lord, reflecting the $35,000,000 actual damages cap, and
accepting the proposed November 15, 2018 outside date — as agreed between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Brooks
earlier that day — and reinserting the clarifying language Locke Lord previously struck regarding EGC’s
employees, officers and directors for the waiver and release of claims of liability and obligation arising from the
merger agreement or merger, as stated above.

Locke Lord informed Sidley in the early morning of June 18, 2018 that it considered the merger agreement
final.

During the night of June 17, 2018 and into the early morning of June 18, 2018, EGC and Cox senior
management and their respective legal counsel resolved the remaining open items and finalized the disclosure
schedules to the merger agreement. At that point, but prior to executing the merger agreement, EGC sent a letter
to ONR, terminating the ONR Term Sheet. As a courtesy, Mr. Brooks also called representatives of both ONR
and Party B to inform them that EGC would be announcing a transaction shortly, but did not identify the
transaction. Shortly after those calls, EGC and Cox, advised by their respective legal counsel, executed the
merger agreement.

On June 18, 2018, prior to market open, EGC issued a press release announcing the merger and hosted a
conference call for the investment community to explain the specific details of the proposed merger.

EGC’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the EGC Board of Directors

In adopting and approving the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, and recommending the adoption of the merger agreement by EGC stockholders, the EGC
board of directors consulted with EGC’s management, as well as with EGC’s legal and financial advisors, and
considered a number of factors. The principal factors that the EGC board of directors viewed as important are:

• approximately 41.7% to the $6.42 per share volume-weighted average trading price of EGC
common stock for the 60 trading days ended June 15, 2018, the last trading day before the public
announcement of the merger agreement;

• the fact that 100% of the merger consideration consists of cash to be paid in full at closing, which
provides certainty of value and immediate liquidity to EGC stockholders while avoiding potential long-
term business risk;

• the requirement that the merger is conditioned on the approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of
the issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock;

• the fact that EGC stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger are entitled to appraisal rights for
their shares for EGC common stock, subject to complying with the procedures described in “The
Merger — Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 63;

• the fact that the merger is not conditioned upon Cox’s obtaining financing, and that Cox’s obligations
under the merger agreement are enforceable by specific performance;

• the fact that the merger is not conditioned upon obtaining the approval of Cox’s stockholders;

• the fact that the merger agreement does not preclude a third party from making an unsolicited proposal
for a competing transaction with EGC and, under certain circumstances more fully described in the
sections titled “The Merger Agreement — No Solicitation of Competing Proposals” beginning on page
71 and “The Merger Agreement — Change in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 72, EGC
may furnish non-public information to and enter into discussions with such third party regarding the
competing transaction and the EGC board of directors may withdraw or modify its recommendations to
EGC stockholders regarding the merger in response to an unsolicited proposal for a competing
transaction;

• the fact that EGC had retained Morgan Stanley in the first quarter of 2017 to assist EGC with a
strategic review of a variety of alternatives — including mergers, a stand-alone plan and capital
infusion options — and that, while EGC had a reasonable level of interest from potential
counterparties, no executable combination resulted from the nine-month review process;

• the fact that, following EGC’s May 10, 2018 announcement of the non-binding term sheet for the
Proposed ONR Transaction, only two additional potential counterparties (Cox and Party B) approached
EGC to discuss strategic transactions for EGC to pursue instead of the Proposed ONR Transaction, and
that only Cox’s proposal contemplated an acquisition of EGC’s entire business;

• the $9.10 per share merger consideration represented a premium of approximately 38.9% over Cox’s
initial proposal of  $6.55 per share, and the conclusion reached by the EGC board of directors, after
discussions with EGC’s management and financial advisors and negotiations with Cox, that the merger
consideration of  $9.10 was likely the highest price per share that Cox was willing to pay and that the
combination of public disclosure of the merger consideration and the ability to respond to unsolicited
proposals for competing transactions (as further described in the sections titled “The Merger
Agreement — No Solicitation of Competing Proposals” beginning on page 71 and “The Merger
Agreement — Change in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 72) would likely result in a sale
of EGC at the highest price per share that was reasonably attainable;

• the expectation that, based upon advice from its regulatory advisors, the merger will obtain all
necessary regulatory approvals without unacceptable conditions;

• the operational and financial challenges that have been experienced by EGC since its emergence from
bankruptcy, including those described in “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements —
Forward-Looking Statements Relating to EGC’s Financial and Operating Performance” beginning on
page 18;

• the fact that, if EGC continues as a stand-alone company, it would need external financing in 2019 in
order to finance its capital expenditures and cash shortfalls from operations;

• the expectation that, even though the Proposed ONR Transaction and the Proposed Party B Transaction
would improve EGC’s balance sheet by removing approximately $321 million of plugging and
abandonment liability and therefore improve EGC’s capability to finance its capital program and
operations, obtaining financing on acceptable terms would still have been challenging;

• the concern that, as the definitive documentation for the Proposed ONR Transaction and the Proposed
Party B Transaction progressed:

• the plugging and abandonment liabilities to be transferred in those proposed transactions would
not be transferred until BOEM approved the assignments of the associated oil and gas assets;

• the third party consents required to replace certain bonds may not have been obtained, resulting in
the failure of the proposed transaction to close; and

• the negotiation between EGC’s First Lien Exit Facility lenders and the proposed counterparty
could fail to produce a mutually acceptable intercreditor agreement, resulting in the failure of the
proposed transaction to close; and

• the fact that, on June 17, 2018, Intrepid delivered to the EGC board of directors its oral opinion,
confirmed by its delivery of a written opinion dated as of the same date, that, as of the date thereof, and
based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications, limitations and other
matters set forth in Intrepid’s written opinion, the merger consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to EGC’s stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox). For additional
information regarding the opinion of Intrepid, see the section titled “The Merger — Opinion of EGC’s
Financial Advisor” beginning on page 44. The full text of the written opinion of Intrepid is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement.

• the recommendation of the merger by EGC management;

• the EGC board of directors’ knowledge of EGC’s business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects, as well as Cox’s business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects, taking
into account the results of EGC’s due diligence review of Cox;

• the review by the EGC board of directors, in consultation with EGC’s management and advisors, of the
structure of the merger and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; and

• the likelihood of consummating the merger on the anticipated schedule.

• the restrictions on the conduct of EGC’s business during the period between the execution of the
merger agreement and the completion of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement;

• that the receipt of merger consideration by EGC stockholders will be fully taxable;

• that the merger consideration represents a 57.0% discount to EGC’s 52-week high trading price, which
occurred on July 28, 2017;

• the costs associated with the completion of the merger, including management’s time and energy and
potential opportunity cost;

• the fact that, if a transaction of the type being negotiated with ONR and Party B were to be successfully
completed and EGC is thereafter able to obtain sufficient financing for its capital budget and operating
budget, then EGC stockholders would be able to continue to participate in any improvement in EGC’s
financial position and operating results;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition to considering the factors above, the EGC board of directors also considered the following
factors:

The EGC board of directors weighed the foregoing against a number of potentially negative factors,
including:

• the fact that, even though the financial statements provided by Cox to EGC show sufficient net worth,
Cox’s liquid assets would not be sufficient to pay the entirety of the merger consideration;

• the fact that Cox had not obtained financing commitments to finance the payment of the merger
consideration at the time of execution of the merger agreement;

• the fact that Cox, as a private company with no publicly-traded securities, has less access to the capital
markets than a publicly-traded counterparty likely would have;

• the fact that, if Cox fails to consummate the merger in accordance the merger agreement, either as a
result of the failure to obtain financing or otherwise, EGC would be entitled to seek specific
performance but its right to recover monetary damages would be subject to a $35,000,000 cap, even
though EGC’s actual damages could be higher;

• the risks and contingencies relating to the announcement and pendency of the merger (including the
likelihood of litigation brought by or on behalf of EGC stockholders challenging the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) and the risks and costs to EGC if the closing
of the merger is not accomplished in a timely manner or if the merger does not close at all, including
the diversion of management and employee attention, potential employee attrition, the impact on
EGC’s relationships with third parties and the effect termination of the merger agreement may have on
the trading price of EGC’s common stock and EGC’s operating results;

• that the interests of EGC’s executive officers and directors with respect to the merger, apart from their
interests as EGC stockholders may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of EGC
stockholders generally, as more fully described under “The Merger — Interests of EGC Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 56;

• the terms of the merger agreement relating to non-solicitation provisions and termination fees, and the
potential that such provisions might deter alternative bidders that might be willing to submit a superior
proposal to EGC;

• that, under the terms of the merger agreement, EGC will be required to pay to Cox a termination fee of 
$8,000,000 and to reimburse Cox for up to $2,000,000 of expenses if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances (see “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees and
Expenses” beginning on page 79); and

• that EGC’s representations and interim operating covenants are significantly more expansive and
restrictive than Cox’s representations and interim operating covenants are, thereby giving Cox more
flexibility between signing and closing of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This discussion of the information and factors considered by the EGC board of directors is forward-looking
in nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described or otherwise referred to in the section
titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 18.

This discussion of the information and factors considered by the EGC board of directors in reaching its
conclusions and recommendation includes the principal factors considered by the board of directors, but is not
intended to be exhaustive and may not include all of the factors considered by the EGC board of directors. In
view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the complexity of these matters, the EGC board of
directors did not find it useful and did not attempt to quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weights to
the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to make its recommendation to EGC stockholders.
Rather, the EGC board of directors viewed its decisions as being based on the totality of the information
presented to it and the factors it considered, including its discussions with, and questioning of, members of EGC’s
management and outside legal and financial advisors. In addition, individual members of the EGC board of
directors may have assigned different weights to different factors.

case as filed with or furnished to the SEC by EGC;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certain of EGC’s directors and executive officers may have financial interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, those of EGC stockholders generally. The EGC board of directors was aware of
and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger and in making its
recommendation to EGC stockholders. For a discussion of these interests, see “The Merger — Interests of EGC
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 56.

The EGC board of directors unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement and
determined that, on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of EGC and its stockholders. The EGC board of directors therefore unanimously recommends that the
EGC stockholders vote:

Opinion of EGC’s Financial Advisor

EGC engaged Intrepid to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. As part of that
engagement, the EGC board of directors requested that Intrepid evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the merger consideration to be received in the merger by EGC stockholders (other than stockholders who
are affiliates of Cox). On June 17, 2018, Intrepid delivered to the EGC board of directors its oral opinion,
confirmed by its delivery of a written opinion dated as of the same date, that, as of the date thereof, and based
upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in
Intrepid’s written opinion, the merger consideration in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to EGC
stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox).

The full text of Intrepid’s written opinion, dated June 17, 2018, which sets forth, among other things,
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Intrepid, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in
this section.

Intrepid provided its opinion solely for the information and benefit of the EGC board of directors (in
its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger. The opinion does not address EGC’s
underlying business decision to enter into the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared with
any other strategic alternative that may be available to EGC. The opinion is not intended to be and does
not constitute a recommendation to any EGC stockholder as to how that stockholder should act or vote
with respect to the merger or any other matter. In addition, the opinion is not rendered to or for the benefit
of, and does not confer rights or remedies upon, any person other than the EGC board of directors
(including any equity holders, creditors, bondholders or other constituencies of EGC or Cox). This
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

Intrepid’s opinion necessarily was based upon information made available to Intrepid as of June 17,
2018 and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated by
Intrepid on that date. Intrepid has no obligation to, and will not, update, revise or reaffirm its opinion
based on subsequent developments. Intrepid’s opinion did not express any opinion as to the price at which
the shares of EGC common stock or any other security of EGC will trade at any time.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Intrepid reviewed, among other things:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Intrepid also conducted the following procedures:

For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Intrepid assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
all of the foregoing information and any other financial, accounting, legal, operational, reserves, tax or other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by it, and Intrepid has not assumed any responsibility for
independent verification of the accuracy or completeness of any such information. Intrepid further relied upon the
assurances of EGC management that they were not aware of any facts that would make such information
inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. With respect to financial forecasts and projections of EGC, Intrepid relied,
with the consent of the EGC board of directors, upon the assurances of EGC’s management that those forecasts
and projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good
faith judgments of EGC’s management as to the future financial performance of EGC, under the assumptions
reflected in those financial forecasts and projections. Intrepid expresses no view as to those financial forecasts or
any judgments, estimates or assumptions on which they were based.

Intrepid further relied, at the direction of EGC management and the EGC board of directors, upon the
assessments of EGC management as to (i) the potential impact on EGC of market and other trends and prospects
for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the oil and gas
industry, including commodity pricing and supply and demand for oil and gas, (ii) the potential impact on the
operations, results and prospect on EGC of the merger, and (iii) existing and future contracts and relationships,
agreements and arrangements with third parties that are necessary or desirable for the operation of EGC. Intrepid
did not undertake an independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible
unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which EGC is or may be a party or is or may be subject.
Intrepid also assumed that there were no material changes in the liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, business or prospectus of or relating to EGC since the date of the latest information relating to EGC
made available to it. Intrepid did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of EGC and did
not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets

or liabilities of EGC, the potential realization of the value of EGC or the solvency or fair value of EGC or any of
the potential parties to the merger under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters, nor was Intrepid furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Estimates of values of companies and
assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actual be
sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, Intrepid assumed no responsibility for their
accuracy.

In rendering its opinion, Intrepid assumed, in all respects material to its analysis and with the consent of the
EGC board of directors, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement
are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by
it under the merger agreement and that the merger will be consummated on the terms described in the merger
agreement, in each case in the draft form reviewed by Intrepid, without any waiver or modification of any
material terms or conditions contained therein. Intrepid assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents, approvals or releases, and any financing, necessary for the consummation of the merger will be
obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the
parties to the merger, their equity holders or the consummation of the merger or materially reduce the expected
benefits of the merger to EGC. Intrepid assumed that the merger will be consummated in a manner that complies
with all applicable federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations. Intrepid assumed that EGC and the EGC
board of directors have relied upon the advice of their counsel, independent accountants, reserve engineers and
other advisors (other than Intrepid) as to all legal, financial reporting, reserves, tax, accounting and regulatory
matters with respect to EGC, the merger agreement and the merger. Intrepid assumed that the final executed and
delivered versions of all documents reviewed by it in draft form will conform in all material respects to the drafts
reviewed by it.

Intrepid was not asked to pass upon, and expresses no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received in the merger by EGC
stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox). Intrepid was not asked to, nor does it express
any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other terms, conditions, aspects or implications of the merger
or any agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into in connection therewith or otherwise, including
the structure or timing of the merger and the covenants of EGC under the merger agreement. Intrepid’s opinion
does not address any financing transactions associated with the merger. In addition, Intrepid does not express any
view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the merger to any individual
subsidiary of EGC or the creditors, bondholders or other constituencies of EGC (other than the EGC
stockholders, as described in Intrepid’s opinion) or its subsidiaries, or the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the
amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to be paid to any officers, directors or
employees or any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration
or otherwise. Intrepid’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
transaction or business strategy in which EGC might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by EGC to
engage in the merger.

Intrepid does not express any opinion as to equity securities or debt securities of EGC or Cox and the price,
trading range or volume at which any securities will trade at any time. Intrepid’s opinion does not address
whether Cox or Merger Sub has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to
consummate the merger. Intrepid’s opinion does not address accounting, legal, actuarial, regulatory, reserves or
tax matters. Intrepid is not a legal, tax or bankruptcy advisor. Its opinion does not constitute a solvency opinion
and does not address the solvency or financial condition of EGC or any of the potential parties to the merger.
Intrepid’s opinion expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability relating to counterparty credit risk, and its
opinion assumes that, for purposes of the opinion, each of EGC and the counterparties to the merger agreement
(including Cox and Merger Sub) is and will continue to be a solvent going concern with a stable and sound
financial condition.

Intrepid’s opinion was necessarily based upon business, market, economic, regulatory and other conditions
as they exist on, and can be evaluated as of, the date of Intrepid’s opinion. Intrepid assumes no responsibility for
updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on developments, circumstances or events occurring after the
date of its opinion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In arriving at its opinion, Intrepid did not attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or factor
considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. Several analytical methodologies were employed by Intrepid in its analyses, and no one single method of
analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Intrepid. Each analytical technique
has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect the value of
particular techniques. Accordingly, Intrepid believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and all
factors in their entirety, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its
opinion. The conclusion reached by Intrepid, therefore, is based on the application of Intrepid’s own experience
and judgment to all analyses and factors considered by it, taken as a whole. Intrepid’s opinion was approved by
the fairness opinion committee of Intrepid.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

The following is a brief summary of the following material financial and comparative analyses that Intrepid
presented to the EGC board of directors in connection with delivering its opinion on June 17, 2018:

In addition to the analyses described above, Intrepid also analyzed and reviewed working capital projections
of EGC provided by EGC management. Certain of Intrepid’s analyses relied on key information provided by
EGC management, including (i) forecasted production and cash flows for the upstream assets of EGC, (ii) lease
operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, (iii) plugging and
abandonment expenditures, and (iv) commodity price assumptions as summarized in the table below (“NYMEX
strip pricing”).

NYMEX Strip Pricing as of June 8, 2018 (Annual Averages)
2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E 2022E 2023E 2024E+

Oil ($/Bbl) $65.13 $62.96 $59.96 $57.61 $55.88 $55.28 $55.28
Gas ($/Mcf) $ 2.92 $ 2.77 $ 2.67 $ 2.65 $ 2.66 $ 2.81 $ 2.81

The following summary does not purport to be a complete description of the financial and comparative
analyses performed by Intrepid, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight
given to those analyses by Intrepid. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application
of those methods to the particular circumstances. A fairness opinion is thus not susceptible to partial analysis or
summary descriptions.

The financial and comparative analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format.
In order to fully understand the analyses performed by Intrepid, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial and comparative
analyses performed by Intrepid. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial and comparative analyses performed by Intrepid.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information is based on market data or conditions as they
existed at the time of the delivery of the opinion, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Implied Valuation Analysis

Intrepid made an assessment of the range of implied total enterprise values of the following analyses to
compare the merger consideration, based on Intrepid’s knowledge of the industry: (i) net asset value,
(ii) discounted cash flows, (iii) precedent asset transactions, (iv) public trading comparables, and (v) premium
paid analysis.

Net Asset Value Analysis

Intrepid calculated the implied valuation of EGC based on the present value of the future pre-tax cash flows
expected to be generated from the estimated proved and probable reserves and resources of EGC’s upstream
assets. In performing this analysis, Intrepid applied discount rates to unlevered free cash flows ranging from, in
the case of proved developed producing reserves, 9% to 10%, in the case of proved developed non-producing
reserves, 10% to 15%, in the case of proved undeveloped reserves, 15% to 20%, and in the case of probable
reserves, 20% to 25%. The risk adjusted discount rate ranges were based on the 36  Annual SPEE Survey
reserve category specifications assuming P50 and P90 probability categories.

Intrepid calculated estimates of EGC’s net asset values from proved and probable reserves by calculating the
result of  (i) the present value of the cash flows generated by the estimated proved developed reserves, proved
undeveloped reserves and probable reserves, minus (ii) the present value of future estimated effects of plugging
and abandonment costs. The total implied proved reserves present value ranged from $104 million to
$172 million, or $1.00/Boe to $1.66/Boe at NYMEX strip pricing. The total implied present value of proved and
probable reserves ranged from $232 million to $340 million, or $1.48/Boe to $2.18/Boe at NYMEX strip pricing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Intrepid performed a discounted cash flow analysis of EGC to calculate the estimated present value, as of
June 8, 2018, of the cash flows EGC is projected to generate for each of the years in the five-year period
beginning with the year ending December 31, 2018, based on projections prepared by EGC management.

Intrepid applied discount rates ranging from 11.6% to 13.6%, reflecting estimates of EGC’s weighted
average cost of capital (“WACC”), which ranged from 100 basis points less than the average WACC of the GoM
companies listed below under “Comparable GoM Company Analysis” (the “GoM Peers”) to 100 basis points
greater than the average WACC of the GoM Peers. Using these discount rates, Intrepid discounted to present
value, as of June 8, 2018 (i) estimates of EGC’s unlevered free cash flows for each of the years in the five-year
period beginning with the year ending December 31, 2018, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for EGC
with EBITDA multiples ranging from 3.0x to 4.0x. Intrepid also calculated the present value of the free cash flow
of EGC using a terminal EBITDA multiple of 3.50x and a discount rate of 12.6% less the PV-10 of the remaining
plugging and abandonment obligations after the 5-year period and arrived at an implied valuation of 
$276.4 million. For purposes of this analysis, “EBITDA” is calculated as total revenue less total operating
expenses (including G&A expenses, severance and ad valorem taxes and other operating expenses).

Comparable GoM Company Analysis

Intrepid reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and market multiples of the following
comparable companies operating in the GoM:

These companies are referred to in this section as the “selected comparable companies.” Intrepid performed
the comparable GoM company analysis based on data derived from public filings and disclosures for Talos and
W&T Offshore and from publicly available disclosure statements for Fieldwood. Although none of the selected
comparable companies is directly comparable to EGC, the companies included were selected because they are
exploration and production companies with operations that, in Intrepid’s experience and professional judgment,
for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain aspects of EGC’s asset profile, operations,
financial profile, size, service profile, geographic exposure and end market exposure. No selected comparable
company or group of companies is identical to EGC. Accordingly, Intrepid believes that purely quantitative
analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the merger and that qualitative judgments
concerning differences between the financial and operating characteristics and prospects of EGC and the selected
comparable companies also are relevant.

Intrepid also calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on information from
public company filings and disclosures, publicly available disclosure statements and consensus analyst estimates.
Enterprise values were calculated for the purpose of these multiples as adjusted for certain mergers or
acquisitions as disclosed in public filings and publicly available disclosure statements. The multiples and ratios
were calculated using applicable market data as of June 8, 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The transactions listed in the table above are referred to in this section as the “selected comparable
transactions.” No selected comparable transaction utilized in the select comparable GoM transaction analysis was
identical or entirely comparable to the merger. Accordingly, Intrepid believes that purely quantitative analyses are
not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the merger and that qualitative judgments concerning differences
between the financial and operating characteristics and prospects of EGC and Cox the selected comparable
transactions that could affect the values are also relevant. Intrepid considered certain financial metrics derived
from such selected comparable transactions. However, Intrepid did not derive or apply any selected comparable
transaction reference ranges in its selected comparable transactions analysis. Intrepid’s valuation was based on
multiples of the transaction value to EBITDAX, proved reserves, current production and acreage for the select
comparable transactions listed above.

Exploration and Production (E&P) Premium Paid Analysis

Intrepid compared the premiums per share paid by an acquirer company in 14 selected domestic E&P
corporate transactions since 2013 with a transaction value ranging from approximately $390 million to
$9.5 billion and involving consideration consisting of cash, stock or a combination thereof. These transactions are
referred to in this section as the “precedent transactions.” For each transaction, Intrepid compared the premiums
per share to the share price of the target company one day prior to announcement of a transaction, and based on a
10-day, 30-day, 60-day and 90-day volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”). With respect to all of those
transactions, Intrepid observed the following mean and medium premiums paid per share price of the target
company as compared to the premium to be paid with respect to the merger:

Premium
1-day 
Prior

10-day 
VWAP

30-day 
VWAP

60-day 
VWAP

90-day 
VWAP

Precedent Transactions Mean 25.1 23.8 25.6 28.2 28.6
Precedent Transactions Median 24.8 24.3 28.2 29.1 29.7
Merger 21.5 NA 22.5 41.7 NA

Intrepid made numerous judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
median and mean, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. Also, the transaction
multiples for the precedent transactions reflect the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry and any potential
business, economic, market, regulatory and other conditions impacting such transactions.

Liquidity Analysis

Intrepid reviewed certain projected financial information provided by EGC management relating to cash
flow of EGC in comparison to its working capital requirements over a 12-month period from January until
December 2018, assuming no strategic transactions or capital raise. Based solely on these projections, Intrepid
observed that, at times at which EGC had less than $50 million of working capital, EGC would be unable to fund
its current liabilities.

General

As described above in this section, the preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Intrepid’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Intrepid considered the results of
all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Intrepid made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of its analyses taken as a whole. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to EGC or the contemplated

transaction. Accordingly, these analyses must take into account differences in the financial and operating
characteristics of the selected publicly traded companies and differences in the structure and timing of the
selected transactions and other factors that would affect the public trading value and acquisition value of the
companies considered.

Intrepid prepared these analyses for purposes of Intrepid providing its opinion only to the EGC board of
directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received in the
merger by the holders (other than Cox and its affiliates) of shares of EGC common stock. These analyses do not
purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may
be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
or their respective advisors, none of EGC, Intrepid or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast.

The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between EGC and Cox and was
approved by the EGC board of directors. Intrepid provided advice to EGC during these negotiations. Intrepid did
not, however, recommend any specific consideration to EGC or the EGC board of directors or that any specific
consideration constituted the only appropriate merger consideration for the merger.

As described above, Intrepid’s opinion to the EGC board of directors was only one of many factors taken
into consideration by the EGC board of directors and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the
EGC board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. The foregoing summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Intrepid in connection with the fairness opinion
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Intrepid attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement.

Miscellaneous

Intrepid and its affiliates, as part of their investment banking business, are regularly engaged in performing
financial analyses with respect to businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, private placements and other transactions as well as for real
estate, corporate and other purposes. Intrepid and its affiliates also engage in advisory work, private equity
activities, underwriting and financing, principal investing, investment management and other financial and non-
financial activities and services for various persons and entities.

Intrepid and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities in which they invest or with which they
co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in (i) equity, debt
and other securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial
instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of EGC, Cox, any of their respective affiliates and third
parties or any of the other parties to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or (ii) any currency
or commodity that may be involved in the transactions and other matters otherwise contemplated by the merger
agreement for the accounts of Intrepid and its affiliates and employees and their customers.

Intrepid acted as financial advisor to EGC in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to, the transaction contemplated by the agreement. Intrepid has provided certain financial advisory
services to EGC and its affiliates from time to time for which Intrepid has received, and may receive,
compensation. Intrepid may also in the future provide investment banking services or other services to EGC, Cox
and their respective affiliates for which Intrepid may receive compensation.

Intrepid was engaged by EGC to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement by entering into an engagement letter. The engagement letter between EGC and Intrepid
provides for an opinion fee of  $1,000,000 (“Opinion Fee”), which has been paid to Intrepid by EGC and was
earned by Intrepid upon delivery, regardless of the conclusion reached by Intrepid. The Intrepid engagement letter
also provides for a transaction fee of  $6,650,000 (“Transaction Fee”), which becomes payable upon the
consummation of the merger. However, $500,000 of the Opinion

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Fee is creditable against the Transaction Fee. In addition, EGC has agreed to reimburse Intrepid for certain of its
expenses, including certain attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Intrepid and related persons
against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

The EGC board of directors selected Intrepid as its financial advisor because it is a nationally recognized
investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. EGC selected Intrepid to act as its financial advisor on the basis of Intrepid’s qualifications and
expertise, knowledge of the oil and gas industry, reputation in the investment community and its experience in
transactions similar to the transactions described in the merger agreement and as well as familiarity with EGC
and its business.

Certain Prospective Unaudited Financial and Operating Information of EGC

EGC does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term projections as to its future revenues,
production, earnings or other results because of, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the evaluation of the proposed merger, EGC is including
the following summary of unaudited prospective financial and operating information, which is included herein
because it was reviewed by and/or used in presentation to the EGC board of directors and Intrepid in connection
with their evaluation of the merger. Intrepid was authorized by EGC to rely upon such information for purposes
of its analysis and opinion. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of
EGC, the EGC board of directors or Intrepid or any other recipient of this information considered, or now
considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results.

The unaudited prospective financial and operating information prepared by the management of EGC was, in
general, prepared solely for its internal use and is subjective in many respects. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the prospective results will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or
lower than estimated. Since the unaudited prospective financial and operating information covers multiple years,
such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. EGC stockholders are urged to
review EGC’s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to EGC’s business.

Neither EGC nor Intrepid has made any representations to Cox concerning prospective information or the
estimates or assumptions on which they are based. EGC urges all stockholders to review EGC’s most recent SEC
filings for a description of EGC’s reported financial results.

The following tables set forth certain summarized prospective operating and financial information regarding
EGC for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as provided by EGC’s management to
Intrepid. It should be noted that the EGC management team’s projections were based on the operational and
financial expectations for EGC’s business, using realized commodity prices. The actual projections used by
Intrepid and in conducting its evaluation and other financial analysis may have differed materially from these
projections as it may have contemplated different assumptions regarding pricing, production risking and
prospective acreage development, among other factors.

Qualifications Regarding Prospective Financial Information of EGC

EGC does not, as a matter of course, make public long-term projections as to its future production, earnings
or other results because of, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates.
However, EGC is including the preceding summary of unaudited prospective financial and operating information
solely because that information was made available to the EGC board of directors and Intrepid. The EGC
prospective financial and operating information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it
prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for the preparation and presentation of financial forecasts
or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which are referred to herein as GAAP. None of
Ernst & Young LLP, which is the independent registered public accounting firm for EGC and is referred to herein
as E&Y, or any other independent accountants, has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with
respect to EGC’s prospective financial and operating information contained herein, nor has E&Y expressed any
opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assumes no responsibility for,
and disclaims any association with, the prospective financial and operating information. The E&Y reports
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to historical financial information for EGC. Such reports
do not extend to EGC’s prospective financial and operating information and should not be read to

TABLE OF CONTENTS

do so. The summary of EGC’s prospective financial and operating information is being included in this proxy
statement not to influence your decision whether to vote for the merger proposal, but because the prospective
financial and operating information was made available to the EGC board of directors and Intrepid in connection
with the merger.

While presented herein with numeric specificity, the information set forth in the summary of EGC’s
prospective financial and operating information contained herein was based on numerous variables and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of EGC’s management, including,
among others, oil and gas activity, commodity prices, demand for natural gas and crude oil and the availability of
financing to fund the exploration and development costs associated with the respective projected drilling
programs. None of this prospective financial and operational information reflects any impact of the merger. In
addition, since EGC’s prospective financial and operating information covers multiple years, such information by
its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.

In addition, the unaudited prospective financial and operating information requires significant estimates and
assumptions that make it inherently less comparable to the similarly-titled GAAP measures in the historical
GAAP financial statements of EGC. EGC believes the assumptions in the prospective financial and operating
information were reasonable at the time the financial information was prepared, given the information EGC had
at the time. However, important factors that may affect actual results and cause the results reflected in EGC’s
prospective financial and operating information not to be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and
uncertainties relating to their respective businesses, industry performance, the regulatory environment, general
business and economic conditions and other matters described in EGC’s filings with the SEC. See also “Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The unaudited prospective financial and operating information also reflects assumptions as to certain
business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the results
reflected in EGC’s prospective financial and operating information. For example, the unaudited prospective
financial and operating information assumes that EGC would be able to implement a $150 million financing
during 2018 in order to fund the capital spending plan and operating budget reflected in these financial forecasts.
There can be no assurance that such a financing could be completed during 2018 or that, if completed, the terms
of the financing would be acceptable. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the results reflected in the
prospective financial and operating information will be realized.

The inclusion of EGC’s prospective financial and operating information in this proxy statement should not
be regarded as an indication that EGC or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or
representatives considered the prospective financial and operating information to be material or predictive of
actual future events, and the prospective financial and operating information should not be relied upon as such.
None of EGC nor any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives can give you any
assurance that actual results will not differ from the results reflected in the prospective financial and operating
information, and none of these persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
prospective financial and operating information to reflect circumstances existing after the dates the prospective
financial and operating information was generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events in the event that
any or all of the assumptions underlying the prospective financial and operating information are shown to be in
error. EGC does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the prospective financial
and operating information. The prospective financial and operational information for EGC does not take into
account any circumstances or events occurring after the date such information was prepared. Readers of this
proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial and operating information
set forth above. None of EGC nor any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives has
made or makes any representation to any stockholder or other person regarding EGC’s ultimate performance
compared to the information contained in the prospective financial and operating information or that financial or
operating results will be achieved. EGC has made no representation to Cox, in the merger agreement or
otherwise, concerning the EGC prospective financial and operating information.

performance-based vesting conditions deemed to be achieved at the target level of performance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EGC’S PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION DOES NOT REPRESENT PROJECTIONS, BUT
RATHER POTENTIAL SCENARIOS BASED ON VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS. ACCORDINGLY,
RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE OUTCOME OF FUTURE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITY AND EGC’S ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL, IN AMOUNTS AND ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE
TO EGC, TO FUND SUCH FUTURE ACTIVITY, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISK AND
UNCERTAINTY. EGC DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE PROSPECTIVE
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER
THE DATE WHEN THE INFORMATION WAS GENERATED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF
FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING
SUCH INFORMATION ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW.

Interests of EGC Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

EGC’s directors and executive officers have various interests in the merger that may be in addition to, or
different from, the interests of EGC stockholders generally. You should keep this in mind when considering the
recommendation of the EGC board of directors “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement. The members of
the EGC board of directors were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the
merger agreement and in recommending that EGC stockholders adopt the merger agreement. These interests are
described below.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the table in the
section titled “— Golden Parachute Compensation” below, were used:

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards

The merger agreement provides that, with respect to all outstanding options and EGC RSUs under EGC’s
stock plans, as a result of the merger:

(1) As of immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding EGC RSU (regardless of whether vested)
will be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash equal to the merger consideration of  $9.10 per
share multiplied by the number of shares subject to each such award. As of the assumed effective time, none
of EGC’s directors held any outstanding equity awards other than the time-based EGC RSUs set forth
above.

* Also a director of EGC.

(1) The exercise price for each outstanding stock option is greater than the merger consideration. As a result, at
the effective time, each stock option to purchase shares of EGC common stock will be cancelled for no
consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards — Summary Tables

Non-Employee Directors

The following table sets forth the cash proceeds that each of EGC’s non-employee directors would receive in
respect of outstanding equity awards held by that director as of the assumed effective time in accordance with the
treatment of outstanding equity awards described above. Depending on when the effective time occurs, certain of
these equity awards may vest, be exercised and/or cancelled, in each case, prior to the actual effective time in
accordance with their terms and independent of the occurrence of the merger. All share numbers have been
rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Executive Officers

The following table sets forth the outstanding vested stock option awards held by each of EGC’s executive
officers as of the assumed effective time. Because the exercise price for each outstanding stock option is greater
than the merger consideration, none of EGC’s executive officers will receive any cash proceeds with respect to
their vested option awards. All EGC RSUs granted to executive officers are settled for shares of EGC common
stock upon vesting. Therefore, with the exception of the vested stock options included in the table below, no
executive officer will hold any EGC RSUs or any other vested equity awards as of the assumed effective time.

Severance Benefits in Employment Agreements with Executive Officers

EGC previously entered into employment agreements (each of which we refer to as an “employment
agreement” and, collectively, the “employment agreements”) with each of its named executive officers specifying
certain compensation and benefits payable to those executive officers in the event of a qualifying termination of
employment, regardless of whether in connection with a change in control.

Under his employment agreement, Douglas E. Brooks will become entitled, subject to his continuing
compliance with restrictive covenants and the execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims against
EGC, to the following termination payments and benefits if  (a) his employment is terminated by EGC without

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Under the employment agreements for each executive officer, “good reason” generally means the existence
of any of the following conditions without the executive’s consent: a material diminution in the executive’s
authority, duties, or responsibilities; a material diminution in the executive’s base salary or target bonus;
relocation outside of greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area; or EGC’s material breach of the employment
agreement. In the case of Mr. Brooks, Mr. Brooks also has good reason if EGC fails to nominate Mr. Brooks for
election as a director or use all reasonable efforts to cause him to be elected or re-elected as director of EGC.

Under the employment agreements for each executive officer, “cause” generally means the occurrence of
any one of the following: gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of, or the executive’s abuse
of alcohol or drugs rendering the executive unable to perform, the material duties and services required for
executive’s position with EGC; the executive’s conviction or plea of nolo contendere for any crime involving
moral turpitude or a felony; the executive’s commission of an act of embezzlement, deceit or fraud intended to
result in personal and unauthorized enrichment of the executive at the expense of EGC or any of its affiliates; the
executive’s material violation of the written policies of EGC or any of its affiliates, material breach of a material
obligation of the executive to EGC pursuant to the executive’s duties and obligations under EGC’s bylaws, or
material breach of a material obligation of the executive to EGC or any of its affiliates pursuant to the
employment agreement or any award or other agreement between the executive and EGC or any of its affiliates;
or the executive’s failure to follow any lawful directive of EGC’s chief executive officer or the EGC board of
directors or other refusal to perform the executive’s duties under the employment agreement.

Under the employment agreements for Mr. Brooks, Ms. Thom Cepak and Ms. Woung-Chapman, “corporate
change” means the consummation of a business combination (including, without limitation, by merger,
consolidation, share exchange, tender offer, exchange offer, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of one of
the parties, or other similar transaction) between EGC (or one of its subsidiaries) and an unaffiliated third party
entity. If consummated, the merger will qualify as a corporate change for purposes of each of those employment
agreements.

Pursuant to each employment agreement for each executive officer, each executive officer is subject to
restrictive covenants related to the protection of confidential information, non-competition, and the diversion of
EGC’s employees. The term of the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants is one year following
termination of employment. An executive officer’s breach of any of the restrictive covenants contained in an
employment agreement entitles EGC to injunctive relief and the return of any severance payments (excluding
accrued obligations) in addition to any other remedies to which EGC may be entitled.

If the severance payments to an executive officer under an employment agreement would cause the
employee to be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”), then EGC will reduce the payments to the largest amount that could be payable without causing any
payment to be subject to the excise tax, but only if that reduction would result in a better after-tax result for the
executive officer.

In addition, upon termination of employment by EGC, EGC will pay any employee (including any executive
officer) for all accrued, unused vacation leave as of the last day of active employment.

For illustrative purposes only, based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions,” it
is currently estimated that EGC’s current executive officers would be entitled to receive, in the aggregate,
approximately $6,965,617 in cash severance benefits under the employment agreements (including COBRA
premium reimbursements and payment of accrued and unused vacation). See the section titled “— Golden
Parachute Compensation” below for an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each of EGC’s
named executive officers under the employment agreements.

Golden Parachute Compensation

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K,
which requires disclosure of compensation that each named executive officer could receive that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the
applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation
payable to EGC’s named executive officers. For additional details regarding the terms of the

(1) The amounts reported in the “Cash” and “Perquisites/Benefits” columns are payable upon a qualifying
termination of employment under the employment agreements and are not attributable to a change in
control. The amounts reported in the “Equity” column are attributable to single-trigger arrangements (i.e.,
accelerated payment will occur upon the completion of the merger regardless of whether the named
executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment).

(2) Amounts reflect cash severance benefits under the employment agreements that would be payable in a lump
sum, assuming a termination of employment by EGC without cause or by the named executive officer for
good reason, as follows: (i) 200% of the named executive officer’s base salary (Mr. Brooks, $1,148,000,
Ms. Cepak, $900,000, and Mr. Heck, $900,000); and (ii) 200% of the named executive officer’s actual
bonus paid (except for Mr. Brooks), which for Mr. Heck is based on the 2017 bonus paid to Mr. Heck and
for Ms. Cepak is to be based on the 2018 bonus paid to Ms. Cepak, but for purposes of this disclosure is
based on Ms. Cepak’s 2018 target bonus opportunity since Ms. Cepak was not eligible to receive a 2017
bonus (Mr. Heck $250,000 and Ms. Cepak, $450,000). Under Mr. Brooks’ employment agreement, the
bonus component of his cash severance during 2018 is based on his 2017 target bonus opportunity
($574,000). In addition, the sign-on bonus received by Ms. Cepak ($224,500) and the retention bonus
received by Mr. Heck ($170,000), each would cease to be subject to clawback if the named executive officer
experiences a qualifying termination of employment.

(3) Amounts reflect the consideration to be received by each named executive officer in connection with the
accelerated vesting of company EGC RSUs held by each of the named executive officers, which

payments and benefits described below, see the discussion above. This merger-related compensation is subject to
a non-binding advisory vote of EGC stockholders, as set forth in proposal two to this proxy statement. See the
section titled “EGC Proposal 2 — Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Compensation” on page 81.

The amounts set forth below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers
using the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions.” These estimates are based on multiple
assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement. Some
of the assumptions are based on information not currently available, and as a result the actual amounts, if any, to
be received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

All dollar amounts set forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number. As described in the
notes to the following table, the named executive officers disclosed in EGC’s proxy statement relating to EGC’s
2018 annual meeting of stockholders include four former executive officers, none of whom has been an EGC
officer or employee during 2018.

(4) As of the assumed effective time, none of EGC’s named executive officers participates in or has account
balances in a qualified or non-qualified defined benefit plan or a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
sponsored or maintained by EGC.

(5) Amounts reflect the payments in respect of continued coverage under EGC’s group health plan for a period
of 18 months following the named executive officer’s termination of employment, based on the insurance
premiums in effect as of the assumed effective time, as provided for under the employment agreements, as
described in detail above in the section titled “— Change in Control Severance Benefit for Executive
Officers.”

(6) None of the named executive officers is eligible to receive a tax reimbursement based on or otherwise
related to the merger. The employment agreements provide that the change in control benefits payable to the
named executive officers are subject to an automatic reduction to avoid the imposition of excise taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code if that reduction would result in a better after-tax result for the named executive
officer. The amounts above do not reflect any possible reductions under those provisions.

(7) Includes payment of accrued and unused vacation, which is a severance benefit available to any EGC
employee terminated by EGC.

(8) In accordance with the SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, this individual is a named executive
officer of the Company with respect to 2017. Mr. Reddin ceased to be EGC’s chief executive officer (a
capacity in which he served on an interim basis) on April 17, 2017, but remained non-executive chairman of
the board and a director until EGC’s annual meeting of stockholders on May 17, 2018. Mr. Schiller, Mr. di
Pinho and Mr. Busmire each ceased to be an officer or employee of EGC on February 2, 2017. Mr. Menown
ceased to be an officer of director of EGC on August 24, 2017. Because each of these named executive
officers separated from the Company prior to the merger and ceased having any outstanding equity awards
following his separation, this named executive officer will not receive any merger-related compensation in
connection with the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

acceleration of vesting for EGC RSUs will occur upon completion of the merger, as described in more detail
above in the section above entitled “— Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards.” Pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement, each outstanding EGC RSU will be fully vested and converted into a right to receive
the merger consideration of  $9.10 per share. For any EGC RSU awards that are subject to performance-
based vesting conditions, the merger agreement provides that performance conditions will be deemed
achieved at target.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Merger

Completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is subject to the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the “HSR Act”). Cox has informed EGC that Cox has determined that the fair market values of EGC’s assets are
below the applicable HSR Act threshold that would require the parties to make a filing under the HSR Act. Cox’s
antitrust counsel has received informal interpretive advice of the Federal Trade Commission’s staff dated June 29,
2018, confirming Cox’s counsel’s interpretation. Accordingly, Cox and EGC have agreed that the closing
condition relating to the HSR Act has been satisfied and that no further action needs to be taken with respect to
the HSR Act.

At any time before or after the effective time, the U.S. antitrust authorities could take action under the
antitrust laws, including seeking to prevent the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally approve the
merger upon the divestiture of assets of Cox or EGC or subject to other remedies. In addition, U.S. state attorneys
general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest
including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to
regulatory concessions or conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws
under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not
be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Treatment of EGC Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards

At or immediately prior to the effective time, any restrictions applicable to each EGC RSU outstanding as of
the effective time, whether or not subject to service-based or performance-based vesting conditions, issued
pursuant to EGC’s 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or the 2018 Long Term
Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (these plans are sometimes referred to together as the “EGC stock
plans”), will, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder of that EGC stock plan,
lapse with the result that all of those outstanding EGC RSUs will be fully vested, with the performance
conditions deemed achieved at target. As a result of the merger, each EGC RSU will be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares of EGC common stock
subject to that EGC RSU, less applicable taxes as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
30 days, after the effective time (or any later date required by the Code).

The exercise price for each outstanding stock option is greater than the merger consideration. As a result, at
or immediately prior to the effective time, each stock option to purchase shares of EGC common stock, regardless
of whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled for no consideration and the holder will have no further rights
with respect to such stock option.

Treatment of EGC Warrants

In accordance with the warrant agreement under which the warrants were issued, the warrants will no longer
represent the right to acquire shares of EGC common stock at the effective time of the merger. Instead, at that
time, each warrant will become exercisable for $9.10 in cash, but the warrant holder would be required to pay the
warrant’s cash exercise price of  $43.66 per share in order to receive $9.10. Therefore, the merger agreement
provides that, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding warrant will be cancelled for no consideration.

Treatment of EGC Credit Agreement

Under the terms of EGC’s First Lien Exit Facility with Wells Fargo National Association, as administrative
agent, and the other lenders and financial institutions party thereto, all amounts outstanding under the First Lien
Exit Facility must be repaid in full at the effective time, and all outstanding letters of credit under the First Lien
Exit Facility must be replaced at that time.

De-Listing and Deregistration of EGC Common Stock

Upon completion of the merger, the EGC common stock currently listed on the NASDAQ will cease to be
listed on the NASDAQ and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Payment of Merger Consideration

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Cox will designate a national bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to EGC to act as paying agent. Promptly after the closing date of the merger, the paying agent will
send to each record holder of EGC common stock at the effective time a letter of transmittal and instructions for
exchanging shares of EGC common stock for merger consideration.

Tax Consequences

For information regarding the tax consequences of the transactions, please see “Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences.”

Appraisal Rights

Under Delaware law, holders of shares of EGC common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the merger, provided that such holders satisfy all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. A
dissenting EGC stockholder will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration provided by the merger
agreement and instead receives a cash payment of the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
be the fair value of the EGC stockholder’s shares of EGC common stock at the effective time, together with
interest on such amount from the effective time until paid. The ultimate

TABLE OF CONTENTS

amount dissenting EGC stockholders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more or less than, or the same as,
the amount such holders would have received under the merger agreement. A detailed description of the appraisal
rights available to holders of EGC common stock and procedures required to exercise statutory appraisal rights is
included in the section titled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 86.

To perfect appraisal rights, a EGC stockholder of record must, among other things, deliver a written demand
for appraisal to EGC before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the EGC special meeting, not
vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, continuously hold the shares of EGC common stock
through the date the merger is completed, and otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Delaware law will result in the loss of
appraisal rights. If the holders of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of EGC common stock demand
appraisal, then Cox is not required to consummate the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following section summarizes material provisions of the merger agreement, which is included in this
proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The rights and obligations of
Cox and EGC are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this
summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. EGC stockholders are urged to read the
merger agreement carefully and in its entirety as well as this proxy statement before making any decisions
regarding the merger, including the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The merger agreement is included in this proxy statement to provide you with information regarding its
terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about EGC, Merger Sub or Cox. The merger
agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the merger agreement. These
representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and:

Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be
read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement
and in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 99.

This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement.

Terms of the Merger; Merger Consideration

The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into EGC in accordance with provisions of the
DGCL. EGC will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will become an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Cox.

The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each share of EGC common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any shares held by Cox or Merger Sub and any
shares held by any other subsidiary of Cox or EGC (the “excluded shares”)) will be converted into and will
thereafter represent the right to receive $9.10 in cash without interest. Because treasury shares are not
“outstanding” shares of common stock for purposes of the DGCL, any treasury shares held by EGC at the
effective time will effectively be treated the same as excluded shares.

The merger agreement provides that each excluded share will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist
as of the effective time and no merger consideration will be delivered or deliverable with respect to any excluded
share.

Shares of EGC common stock owned by any EGC stockholder who has not voted those shares in favor of
the merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of those shares under Delaware law
will not be converted into the right to receive merger consideration and will be cancelled, and the holder of those
shares will instead be entitled to the appraisal rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement. If any holder of dissenting shares fails
to perfect, or has effectively withdrawn or lost, its right to appraisal under Delaware law, that holder’s shares will
be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

and the due and valid execution and delivery and enforceability of the merger agreement;

• absence of conflicts with, or violations of, organizational documents, other contracts, permits and
applicable laws;

• absence of certain litigation; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Completion of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place at 9:00 a.m., Houston time, on the second business day following
the day on which the last condition to the closing has been satisfied or waived. The merger will be effective at the
time of filing of the certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, or at a later time as Cox and EGC
agree to, as set forth in the certificate of merger.

Cox and EGC currently expect the closing of the merger to occur in the third calendar quarter of 2018.
However, because the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions described in the merger
agreement, it is possible that factors outside the control of Cox and EGC could result in the merger being
completed at a later time or not at all.

Payment of Merger Consideration

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Cox will designate a national bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to EGC to act as paying agent (the “paying agent”) for the holders of EGC common stock in
connection with the merger to receive the cash necessary to make the cash payments contemplated by the merger
agreement. At the effective time, shares of EGC common stock will be converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration without the need for any action by the holders of EGC common stock. Promptly, and in any
event no later than two business days, after the effective time, Cox will deposit cash with the paying agent in an
amount sufficient to pay the merger consideration to the EGC stockholders.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, but in no event more than five business days
thereafter, EGC will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of a certificate formerly representing a share of
EGC common stock or any corresponding book-entry share of EGC common stock (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying, among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates
representing EGC common stock will pass, only upon proper delivery of those certificates to the paying agent or,
in the case of book-entry shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in that letter and (ii) instructions
explaining the procedure for surrendering EGC stock certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for the merger
consideration. Each holder of EGC stock certificates or book-entry shares may thereafter until the first
anniversary of the effective time of the merger surrender those certificates or book-entry shares to the paying
agent, as agent for that holder, under cover of the letter of transmittal.

After the effective time, shares of EGC common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be automatically
cancelled and will cease to exist and each certificate, if any, that previously represented shares of EGC common
stock will represent only the right to receive the merger consideration as described above.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by each party to the merger agreement
regarding aspects of that party’s business, financial condition, structure and other facts pertinent to the merger.
Each of EGC and Cox have made representations and warranties regarding, among other things:

• compliance with laws.

• absence of undisclosed material liabilities;

• capital structure;

• certain required permits;

• SEC documents;

• corporate governance;

• absence of certain changes and events since December 31, 2017;

• absence of undisclosed related party transactions;

• insurance;

• material contracts;

• derivative transactions;

• opinion of financial advisor;

• brokers’ fees;

• anti-takeover statutes; and certificate restrictions; and

• regulatory matters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EGC has also made additional representations and warranties relating to:

Additional representations and warranties made only by Cox and Merger Sub relate to, among other things,
availability of funds, the absence of business conduct by Merger Sub and ownership of EGC common stock.

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “materiality” or
“material adverse effect” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to
be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or have a material
adverse effect). For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” means, with respect to a party,
a state of facts, change, event, effect or occurrence (when taken together with all other states of fact, changes,
events, effects or occurrences), that is or could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse (a) in the case of
EGC, (i) the financial condition, results of operations, prospects, properties, assets or liabilities of EGC and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of EGC to consummate the merger by the November 15, 2018
termination date and (b) in the case of Parent, the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the merger by
the November 15, 2018 termination date. However, with respect to EGC only, no state of facts, change, event,
effect or occurrence arising or related to any of the following will be deemed to constitute, and none of the
following will be taken into account in determining whether there has been a material adverse effect (except in
the case of the first four bullet points below, that state of facts, change, event, effect or occurrence
disproportionately affects EGC and its subsidiaries, taken as whole, as compared to other persons or businesses
engaging principally in the industry in which EGC or its subsidiaries operate):

• national or international business, economic or political conditions, including the engagement by the
United States of America in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national
emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack upon the United States of
America;

• financial, banking or securities markets;

• the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including changes in oil, gas or other
commodity prices and general market prices and changes in costs of supplies, oil field services or other
operating costs);

• changes in law or GAAP or the interpretation thereof; or

• the failure to meet or exceed any projection or forecast (it being understood that the underlying
circumstances giving rise to that failure may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a material adverse effect unless otherwise excluded by this provision).

• declare, set aside or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions in respect of any outstanding
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, itself or any of its subsidiaries (other than dividends and
distributions by a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary to EGC or to another subsidiary of EGC);

• split, combine or reclassify any capital stock of, or other equity interests in, EGC or any of its
subsidiaries;

• repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or offer to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, EGC or any of its subsidiaries, except as required by the
terms of any capital stock of, or other equity interests in, EGC or any of its subsidiaries outstanding on
the date of the merger agreement or as contemplated by any existing director compensation plan,
employee benefit plan, or employment agreement of EGC, in each case, as those terms, plans or
arrangements are in effect as of the date of the merger agreement;

• offer, issue, deliver, grant or sell, or authorize or propose to offer, issue, deliver, grant or sell, any
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, EGC or any of its subsidiaries or any securities convertible
into, or any rights, warrants or options to acquire, any capital stock or equity interests of EGC or any of
its subsidiaries, other than:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

However, with respect to EGC only, any moratoriums on (or changes or proposed changes in applicable law
related to) the offshore exploration, development and/or operation of hydrocarbon assets that would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of making those activities illegal or commercially impracticable may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a material adverse effect.

Conduct of Business

EGC has agreed to certain covenants in the merger agreement restricting the conduct of its business between
the date of the merger agreement and the effective time. In general, EGC has agreed to conduct its business in the
ordinary course, consistent with past practice and use all commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its
present business organization, retain its officers and key employees, and preserve its relationships with its
customers and suppliers and other persons having significant business dealings with it, to the end that its goodwill
and ongoing business will not be impaired in any material respect. EGC has also agreed to comply, in all material
respects, with all applicable law, except where the failure to comply would not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect, and to not voluntarily resign, transfer or relinquish any
right as operator of its oil and gas properties.

In addition, EGC has agreed to specific restrictions relating to the conduct of its business between the date
of the merger agreement and the effective time, including, but not limited to, not to take (or permit any of its
subsidiaries to take) the following actions (subject, in each case, to exceptions specified below and in the merger
agreement or previously disclosed in writing to Cox as provided in the merger agreement or as consented to in
advance by Cox (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as required by
law or in the event of certain emergencies):

recommendation”); or

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition, Cox has agreed to specific restrictions relating to the conduct of its business between the date of
the merger agreement and the effective time, including, but not limited to, the following (except as consented to
in advance by EGC):

No Solicitation of Competing Proposals

Promptly after the date of the merger agreement, and as required by the merger agreement, EGC terminated
all physical and electronic data access to all counterparties with respect to which EGC has discussed potential
transactions that would be treated as competing proposals under the merger agreement.

From and after the date of the merger agreement and except as otherwise specifically provided for in the
merger agreement, EGC is prohibited from, will cause its subsidiaries not to, and must use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, advisors, controlled affiliates,
and other representatives (collectively, the “representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly:

However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the EGC stockholders, EGC is permitted under
the merger agreement to take any or all of the actions described in the first three bullets above with any person
who has made a competing proposal. Nevertheless, EGC is permitted to take those actions only if  (A) no non-
public information is furnished to the party making the competing proposal until EGC receives from that party an
executed confidentiality agreement that does not contain provisions that prohibit EGC from complying with the
provisions of the merger agreement and (B) prior to taking any of those actions, the EGC board of directors or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the competing proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal.

• the EGC board of directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the competing proposal is a superior proposal (taking
into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the merger proposed by Cox in response to

conditions of that proposal, and, that EGC intends to take that action, and either:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A “competing proposal” means any contract, proposal, offer or indication of interest relating to any
transaction or series of related transactions (other than transactions with Cox or any of its subsidiaries) involving:
(i) any direct or indirect acquisition (by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, or otherwise) by any person or
group of any business or assets of EGC or any of its subsidiaries (including capital stock of or ownership interest
in any subsidiary) that generated 20% or more of EGC’s consolidated net revenue or earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization for the preceding 12 months, or any license, lease or long-term supply
agreement having a similar economic effect, (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership by any
person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of EGC common stock or any tender or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of EGC common stock or (iii) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving EGC that is structured to permit any
person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 20% of EGC’s consolidated assets or equity interests.

A “superior proposal” means any written proposal by any person or group (other than Cox or any of its
affiliates) to acquire, directly or indirectly, (i) businesses or assets of EGC or any of its subsidiaries (including
capital stock of or ownership interest in any subsidiary) that generated 50% or more of EGC’s consolidated net
revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the preceding 12 months,
respectively, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of EGC common stock, in each case, whether by
way of merger, amalgamation, share exchange, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, consolidation, sale
of assets or otherwise, that, in the good faith determination of the EGC board of directors or any committee
thereof, after consultation with its financial advisors and after taking into account relevant legal, financial,
regulatory, estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of that proposal and the person or group making
that proposal, would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a transaction more favorable to EGC
stockholders than the merger.

The merger agreement requires EGC to advise Cox within two business days of  (i) any competing proposal,
(ii) any request for non-public information or data relating to EGC or any of its subsidiaries made by any person
that has made, or has informed EGC it is considering making, a competing proposal and (iii) any request for
discussions or negotiations with EGC or its representatives relating to a competing proposal. EGC is also
required to provide Cox, within two business days of its receipt of a competing proposal, with a copy of that
competing proposal or a written summary of the material terms of that competing proposal.

Change in Board Recommendation

The EGC board of directors unanimously recommends that the EGC stockholders adopt the merger
agreement. However, the merger agreement permits the EGC board of directors (or a committee thereof), at any
time prior to receipt of the required EGC stockholder approval, to effect an EGC change of recommendation if,
prior to taking that action, the EGC board of directors or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take that action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the EGC board of directors’ fiduciary duties to the EGC stockholders under applicable law.

Even though the merger agreement permits the EGC board of directors to effect an EGC change of
recommendation under certain circumstances, an EGC change of recommendation does not necessarily permit
EGC to terminate the merger agreement to accept a competing proposal. In order to terminate the merger
agreement for that purpose, EGC must satisfy additional requirements. At any time prior to obtaining the required
EGC stockholder approval, the EGC board of directors (or any committee thereof) may cause EGC to terminate
the merger agreement in order to accept a competing proposal that the EGC board of directors determines is a
superior proposal if, prior to taking that action:

• Cox has not proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement prior to the
scheduled time for the EGC special meeting or the second business day after the date on which
EGC’s notice is given to Cox, whichever is earlier; or

• if Cox within the period described above has proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by EGC, and the
EGC board of directors (or any committee thereof), after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the competing proposal remains
a superior proposal with respect to Cox’s revised proposal.

• the obtaining of all required consents and the taking of all commercially reasonable steps as may be
required to obtain a consent from any governmental authority;

• the obtaining of all consents from any third persons as reasonably requested by Cox, and the persons
set forth in the applicable schedule of Cox’s disclosure schedule, including the exercise or use, upon the
reasonable request by Cox, by EGC of all rights and remedies necessary or available under the contract
under which the consent is sought (but excluding the initiation of any proceeding unless Cox and EGC
mutually agree), to procure the waivers or consents to assignment set forth in that schedule of Cox’s
disclosure schedule. However, in connection with obtaining those consents, EGC may not, without the
prior written consent of Cox, pay or commit to pay to any person whose consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration (other than any de minimis amounts), or incur or agree to incur any non-de
minimis liability for the benefit of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of the process described above, each time material modifications are made to the financial
terms of a competing proposal the EGC board determines to be a superior proposal, EGC must wait an additional
24 hours after notifying Cox of that modification before EGC may effect an EGC change of recommendation or
terminate the merger agreement.

Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Votes

EGC will take all action necessary to duly give notice of, convene and hold a stockholders meeting as soon
as reasonably practicable after the clearance of the proxy statement by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining
stockholder approval of the adoption of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. The EGC board of directors has (i) approved and declared advisable the
merger agreement, (ii) resolved to recommend adoption of the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to EGC stockholders, and (iii) directed that the merger
agreement be submitted to the EGC stockholders for adoption.

EGC is required to adjourn or postpone the EGC special meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to the EGC stockholders or (ii) if, as
of the time for which the EGC special meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of EGC common stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the EGC
special meeting. Furthermore, EGC may adjourn or postpone the EGC special meeting if, as of the time for which
the EGC special meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of EGC common stock represented to obtain
the required EGC stockholder approval. However, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the EGC special
meeting may not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than 20 business days after the date for which
the meeting was previously scheduled. EGC may not adjourn or postpone the EGC special meeting to a date on
or after two business days prior to the termination date (as defined below). Nevertheless, EGC may adjourn or
postpone the EGC special meeting to a date no later than the second business day after the expiration of any of
the negotiation periods set forth in the merger agreement relating to EGC’s response to a competing proposal, as
described above in “— Change in Board Recommendation.”

Efforts to Complete the Merger; Consents and Regulatory Approvals

The parties to the merger agreement have each agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper and advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the merger, including:

• the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
merger and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement.

• recognize all service of those employees with EGC or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, accruals, and entitlement to benefits where
length of service is relevant, other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or as
would result in a duplication of benefits;

• waive any pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements to the extent those conditions were waived or satisfied under similar employee benefit
plans immediately prior to the effective time; and

• provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles incurred prior to the effective time for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any of those Cox
benefit plans that may apply as of or following the effective time for the year in which the effective
time occurs.

that person in connection therewith, and none of Cox, Merger Sub or any of their respective
subsidiaries will be required prior to the closing to pay or commit to pay to any person whose consent
is being solicited any cash or other consideration (other than any de minimis amounts), nor incur or
agree to incur any non-de minimis liability for the benefit of that person in connection therewith); and

Cox has informed EGC that Cox has determined that the fair market values of EGC’s assets are below the
applicable HSR Act threshold that would require the parties to make a filing under the HSR Act. Cox’s antitrust
counsel has received informal interpretive advice of the Federal Trade Commission’s staff dated June 29, 2018,
confirming Cox’s counsel’s interpretation. Accordingly, Cox and EGC have agreed that the closing condition
relating to the HSR Act has been satisfied and that no further action needs to be taken with respect to the HSR
Act.

Employee Benefits Matters

With respect to any employee benefit plan (“benefit plan”) of Cox or its subsidiaries (the “Cox group”) in
which the officers and employees who are employed by EGC or any of its subsidiaries as of the effective time
(the “employees”) or their respective beneficiaries and dependents are otherwise eligible to participate effective
as of the effective time, Cox shall, or shall cause the surviving corporation to take commercially reasonable
efforts to:

From and after the effective time, EGC or the surviving corporation will, and Cox will cause EGC or the
surviving corporation, as applicable, to, honor, in accordance with their terms, all employment, severance,
income continuity and change of control programs, plans or agreements between EGC and the employees,
including bonuses, incentives, severance payments or deferred compensation in existence on the date of the
merger agreement. However, the merger agreement does not prohibit Cox, EGC or the surviving corporation
from amending, suspending or terminating any of those arrangements in accordance with their terms. Even so,
under the terms of EGC’s severance plans, Cox will not be permitted to unilaterally amend or terminate EGC’s
severance plans during the first 12 months following the effective time of the merger.

The merger agreement provisions described in this section titled “Employee Benefit Matters” are included
for the sole benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and will not create any right in any other person,
including any employee, former employee, or any participant in any employee benefit plan (or beneficiary
thereof), including any right to continued (or resumed) employment with Cox, the surviving corporation or any of
their respective subsidiaries for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever. No provision described in
this section constitutes an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan of EGC or its
subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan of the Cox group, or limit Cox’s or the surviving corporation’s power
to amend or terminate any particular employee benefit plan of EGC or its subsidiaries or any employee benefit
plan of the Cox group or require (and EGC will take no action that would require) Cox or surviving corporation
to continue any particular employee benefit plan of EGC or its subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan of the
Cox group.

similar device unless EGC takes all necessary action to render that device inapplicable to the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and in the event that any “fair
price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “interested stockholder,” “business combination,”
anti-takeover or other similar statute, rule or regulation enacted under state or federal laws in the
United States may become or may purport to be applicable to EGC is applicable to the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the obligation of each of EGC
and Cox to grant those approvals and take those actions as are

Treatment of EGC Equity Awards

EGC RSUs.   At or immediately prior to the effective time, any restrictions applicable to each EGC RSU
outstanding as of the effective time, whether or not subject to service-based or performance-based vesting
conditions, issued pursuant to the EGC stock plans will, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of that EGC RSU, lapse with the result that all of those outstanding EGC RSUs will be fully
vested, with the performance conditions deemed achieved at target. As a result of the merger, each EGC RSU will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, multiplied by the number of shares
of EGC common stock subject to that EGC RSU, less applicable taxes as soon as reasonably practicable, but in
no event later than 30 days, after the effective time (or any later date required by the Code).

All payments with respect to EGC RSUs will be made through the surviving corporation’s payroll system,
and the surviving corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of an EGC RSU pursuant to the merger agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of that payment under applicable law, including taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so properly deducted and withheld by the surviving corporation, those amounts will be treated for all purposes of
the merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of EGC RSU for which that deduction and withholding
were made by the surviving corporation. No interest will be paid or accrue on the amounts payable pursuant to
this section in respect of any EGC RSU.

Stock Options.   Each outstanding stock option granted under the EGC stock plans has a per share exercise
price that is greater than the merger consideration. Therefore, at or immediately prior to the effective time, each
outstanding option for the purchase of EGC common stock issued pursuant to any EGC stock plan outstanding
(whether or not then vested or exercisable), by virtue of the occurrence of the closing of the merger and without
any action on the part of the holder, will be cancelled for no consideration and the holder shall have no further
rights with respect to that EGC stock option.

Other Covenants and Agreements

The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including covenants relating to:

• the de-listing from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and the de-registering under the Exchange Act,

issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock;

• the expiration of any waiting periods or the receipt of any approvals required to be obtained for the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under
any applicable laws (as described in the section titled “The Merger — Regulatory Clearances Required
for the Merger” on page 62, Cox and EGC have agreed that the closing condition relating to the HSR
Act has been satisfied); and

• the absence of any laws, temporary restraining orders, preliminary or permanent injunctions or other
orders that have the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
merger.

• each of the representations and warranties of EGC set forth in the merger agreement being true and
correct as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date as though made on and as of
the closing date, unless otherwise specified, except for those failures to be true and correct (without
regard to qualification or exceptions contained therein as to materiality or material adverse effect) that
has not had and could not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect with respect to EGC. However, this materiality qualifier will not apply to EGC’s
representations and warranties regarding (A) organization, standing and power, (B) authority, (C) this
proxy statement, (D) absence of certain changes since December 31, 2017, (E) title to oil and gas
properties, (F) the opinion of financial advisor and (G) brokers;

Cox has also agreed not to, for six years after the effective time, repeal or otherwise modify the surviving
corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in any manner that would affect adversely the rights of any
indemnified person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by law. Cox
has further agreed to maintain officers’ and directors’ liability insurance, on behalf of EGC’s current and former
directors and officers, in an amount and scope at least as favorable as EGC’s existing director and officer liability
policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the surviving corporation will not be required to pay more than 300% of
the last annual premium paid by EGC for the six years of coverage. However, if the cost of that director and
officer insurance is greater than the 300% cap, Cox will purchase as much coverage as is reasonably obtainable
for a premium equal to the cap.

The obligations of Cox, EGC and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the following conditions on or prior to the closing date, any or all of which may be waived by the
parties to the merger agreement, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

effect) that have not had and could not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse effect with respect to Cox;

• Cox and Merger Sub each having performed or complied with, in all material respects, all obligations

merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any material
covenant or agreement under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the action
or event described in this paragraph;

• if the merger has not been consummated by 5:00 p.m., Houston time, on November 15, 2018 (the

has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before the termination
date;

In addition, the obligation of EGC to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
following conditions at the closing date:

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
effective time, whether before or after the receipt of the required stockholder approvals, under the following
circumstances:

• upon a breach by the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in the merger agreement that would result in the failure of one of certain conditions to
the terminating party’s obligations to complete the merger, if that breach is (i) continuing as of the
closing date and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after written notice thereof to
the breaching party (or, if earlier, has not been cured by the termination date) (any breach of that
type, a “terminable breach”). However, this right to terminate the merger agreement is not
available to any party that is itself in terminable breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement in the merger agreement;

• if the required EGC stockholder approval shall not have been obtained upon a vote held at a duly
held EGC special meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. However, this
termination right will not be available to EGC if the failure to obtain the required EGC
stockholder approval was the result of EGC’s breach or failure to perform in any material respect
any of its obligations under the merger agreement relating to the preparation or filing of this proxy
statement or the calling or conduct of the EGC special meeting;

• by Cox if the EGC board of directors of makes an EGC change of recommendation; or

• by EGC, prior to receipt of the EGC stockholder approval, in order to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a superior proposal, but only if EGC (i) tenders the required termination fee to Cox
contemporaneously with that termination and (ii) has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under the merger agreement relating to that superior proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Specific Performance

The parties to the merger agreement agreed that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of the merger agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms thereof or were otherwise
breached. Each party agreed that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the merger agreement, the
non-breaching party will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or
equity, including monetary damages (but only to the extent expressly limited by the merger agreement) to seek
and obtain in the courts (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance
of that covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining that breach or threatened breach. Each party
further agreed not to assert that any of those remedies is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for
any reason, nor to object to any of those remedies on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party further acknowledged and agreed that the right to seek and
obtain specific performance in the event of a breach of the merger agreement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and that, without that right, the other parties would not have entered into
the merger agreement.

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is terminated by any party in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement will
become void and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of any party thereto, except with respect to:
(i) the provision setting forth the effect of termination; (ii) breaches of the confidentiality agreement between
EGC and Cox and the unauthorized use of information for purposes unrelated to the transactions under the
merger agreement; (iii) the payment of any termination fees or expenses; and (iv) the general provisions of the
merger agreement governing, among other things, choice of law, waiver of jury trial and the rights of the parties
to specific performance. However, neither any such termination nor any provision of the merger agreement will
relieve any party from liability for any damages for a willful and material breach of the merger agreement
(including, in the case of EGC, damages based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to
EGC’s stockholders), damages arising from a willful and material breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation in the merger agreement or fraud. Therefore, in the event that all closing conditions were satisfied
(other than those customarily satisfied at closing), but Cox or EGC breached its obligation to consummate the
merger, the non-breaching party

• If Cox terminates the merger agreement because, prior to obtaining the approval of the EGC
stockholders, the EGC board of directors makes an EGC change of recommendation (including in
connection with a superior proposal), then EGC will pay Cox the termination fee;

• If EGC terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, then EGC will pay Cox
the termination fee;

• If either Cox or EGC terminates the merger agreement because EGC failed to obtain the required
approval from the EGC stockholders, then EGC will reimburse Cox for its reimbursable expenses up to
the reimbursement amount;

• If Cox terminates the merger agreement as a result of EGC’s terminable breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement, then EGC will reimburse Cox for its reimbursable expenses up
to the reimbursement amount.

• If  (i) Cox terminates the merger agreement because the merger has not been consummated on or before
the November 15, 2018 termination date and (ii) on or before the date that Cox terminates the merger
agreement, a competing proposal has been announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the
EGC board of directors, then EGC will reimburse Cox for its reimbursable expenses up to the
reimbursement amount;

• If each of the three following conditions are met, then EGC will pay Cox the termination fee:

• If  (i) either EGC or Cox terminates the merger agreement because the merger has not been
consummated on or before the November 15, 2018 termination date, (ii) Cox terminates the
merger agreement as a result of EGC’s terminable breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement or (iii) either Cox or EGC terminates the merger agreement because
EGC failed to obtain the required approval from the EGC stockholders;

• on or before the date of the merger agreement is terminated, a competing proposal has been
announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the EGC board of directors; and

• within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated, EGC enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to that competing proposal or consummates that competing proposal.

would be entitled to specific performance, as described above, or to seek actual damages up to $35,000,000 in the
aggregate. The parties have agreed that in no event will the total amount of monetary damages for which Cox or
EGC would be liable under the merger agreement be greater than $35,000,000.

Termination Fees and Expenses

In the following circumstances, a termination fee may be owed by EGC to Cox. For this purpose, the
“termination fee” will be $8,000,000 and the “reimbursement amount” will mean the documented out-of-pocket
costs expenses incurred by Cox in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of the merger
agreement and the transactions, subject to a cap of  $2,000,000.

In no event shall Cox be entitled to receive more than one payment of a termination fee and one payment of
the reimbursement amount. Except as provided above, each party to the merger agreement will pay its own costs
and expenses in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers

Prior to obtaining EGC stockholder approval, the merger agreement may be amended at any time by all
parties thereto. Following the obtaining of EGC stockholder approval, no amendment to the merger agreement
will be effective if that amendment would require by law the further approval by the EGC stockholders without
first obtaining that further approval. The merger agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties thereto.

At any time prior to the effective time, the parties to the merger agreement, by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties to the merger

agreement; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in or in any document
delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or
conditions contained in the merger agreement. Any agreement by a party to the merger agreement to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of that party.

No Third Party Beneficiaries

While the merger agreement is not intended to confer upon you or any person other than EGC, Cox and
Merger Sub any rights or remedies under or by reason of the merger agreement, it provides limited exceptions.
EGC and any of its subsidiaries’ directors and officers will continue to have the right to indemnification and
liability insurance coverage for a period of time after the completion of the merger and these rights may be
enforced by those officers and directors.

PROPOSALS FOR THE EGC SPECIAL MEETING

EGC Proposal 1 — Merger Agreement

For a summary and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger
agreement throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in section titled “The Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 65. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement.

Under the merger agreement, approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. If the
proposal is not approved, the merger with Cox and the transactions will not be completed even if the other
proposals related to the transactions are approved.

Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of two-
thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock entitled to vote at the EGC special meeting.
Failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval
of such proposal.

The EGC board of directors has unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement, has
determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are in the best interests of the EGC
stockholders and unanimously recommends that EGC stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

EGC Proposal 2 — Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Compensation

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires EGC to provide its stockholders with the opportunity to vote to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to EGC’s
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the compensation table and the related narrative named
executive officer compensation disclosures set forth in “The Merger — Interests of EGC Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 56. This vote is commonly referred to as a “golden parachute say on
pay” vote. Accordingly, EGC’s stockholders are being provided with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on
these change of control payments.

Because the vote is advisory, the vote on this proposal is not binding on EGC or the EGC board of directors.
Furthermore, approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger.

EGC is seeking approval of the following resolution at the EGC special meeting:

“RESOLVED, that EGC’s stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of
EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger, as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger — Interests of EGC Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” (which disclosure includes the compensation table and related narrative
named executive officer compensation disclosures required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”

Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
EGC’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of EGC common stock present,
in person or by proxy, at the EGC special meeting and entitled to vote thereon which has actually been voted,
assuming there is a quorum. If you attend the EGC special meeting or are represented by proxy and, in either
case, abstain from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” this proposal. Failures
to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for this proposal.

The EGC board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to EGC’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the proposed merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EGC Proposal 3 — Possible Adjournment of the EGC Special Meeting

If EGC fails to receive a sufficient number of votes to approve EGC Proposal 1, EGC may propose to
adjourn the EGC special meeting, if a quorum is present, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to
approve EGC Proposal 1. EGC currently does not intend to propose adjournment of the EGC special meeting if
there are sufficient votes to approve EGC Proposal 1. The proposal to adjourn the EGC special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies requires the approval of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of EGC common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the EGC special meeting and entitled
to vote thereon which has actually been voted, regardless of whether a quorum is present. If you attend the EGC
special meeting or are represented by proxy and, in either case, abstain from voting, that abstention will have the
same effect as voting “AGAINST” this proposal. Failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on the
vote for this proposal. EGC’s bylaws permit the chairman of the board to adjourn the meeting without a
stockholder vote, regardless of whether a quorum is present.

The EGC board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn
the EGC special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to “U.S.
holders” (as defined below) and “non-U.S. holders” (as defined below) of EGC common stock whose shares are
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger. No rulings have been or will
be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax issues
discussed in this section, however, and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not successfully
challenge the conclusions reached in this section.

This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial
opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the IRS, each as in effect as of the date hereof.
These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the
accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax
consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax imposed pursuant to Section 1411 of
the Code, nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign tax laws or U.S. federal laws
other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax (e.g., U.S. estate or gift tax laws).

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of EGC common stock that
is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of EGC common stock that is an individual, corporation,
estate or trust that is not a U.S. holder.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds shares of EGC common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally
depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners of partnerships holding shares
of EGC common stock are encouraged to consult their tax advisors.

This discussion applies only to holders of EGC common stock that hold such shares as capital assets within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does
not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of EGC common stock in
light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to a holder of EGC common stock that is subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, insurance companies; controlled
foreign corporations; passive foreign investment companies; holders who hold their shares of EGC common
stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident
outside the United States; dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies; traders in securities who elect the
mark-to-market method of accounting; holders subject to the alternative minimum tax; holders that have a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans, individual retirement
accounts and other tax-deferred accounts; governmental agencies or instrumentalities; banks and certain other
financial institutions; mutual funds; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; persons who
are former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States (U.S. expatriates); partnerships, S
corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other entities; holders who hold
shares of EGC common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other risk
reduction transaction; or holders who acquired their shares of EGC common stock through the exercise of
employee stock options or other compensation arrangements.

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods
aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year of the merger and certain other conditions are
met;

• the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by the non-U.S. holder in the United States); or

• EGC is or has been a United States real property holding corporation, as that term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code, or “USRPHC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the
shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder
holds shares of EGC common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. Holders

Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders

The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of EGC common stock
pursuant to the merger will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S.
holder who receives the merger consideration in exchange for shares of EGC common stock pursuant to the
merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any,
between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of EGC common
stock.

If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of EGC common stock it surrenders in the merger is greater
than one year as of the effective time, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital
gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at
reduced preferential rates. Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of EGC common stock at different times
and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with
respect to each block of EGC common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Applicable to U.S. Holders

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received
by a U.S. holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. holder that (i) is a
corporation or entity that is otherwise exempt from backup withholding (which, when required, certifies as to its
status) or (ii) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification on IRS
Form W-9.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder
furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

Non-U.S. Holders

Tax Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders

The receipt of the merger consideration by non-U.S. holders in exchange for shares of EGC common stock
pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at a flat rate of 30% (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides an exemption or lower rate), on any gain
recognized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses.

A non-U.S. holder whose gain is described in the second bullet point above generally will be taxed on such
gain on a net income basis at the same graduated rates generally applicable to U.S. holders. If the non-U.S. holder
is a corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax (at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an
applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits attributable to such gain, as
adjusted for certain items.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

With respect to the third bullet point above, generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of
its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real
property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. EGC believes that it currently is
a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, provided its common stock is ‘‘regularly traded on an
established securities market’’ at the effective time, a non-U.S. holder will be taxable on gain recognized pursuant
to the merger as a result of EGC’s status as a USRPHC only if the non-U.S. holder actually or constructively
owns, or owned at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger or, if shorter, the non-
U.S. holder’s holding period for its EGC common stock, more than 5% of the shares of EGC common stock.
EGC believes that shares of its common stock are considered to be regularly traded on an established securities
market for purposes of the foregoing rules.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders With Respect to the Merger

Payments made pursuant to the merger to a non-U.S. holder by or through a U.S. office of a broker generally
will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) unless the non-U.S.
holder establishes an exemption by properly certifying its non-U.S. status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E (or
another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8) and certain other conditions are met, or the non-U.S. holder
otherwise establishes an exemption. Payments effected through a non-U.S. office of a U.S. broker or a non-U.S.
broker with substantial U.S. ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to payments
effected through a U.S. office of a broker.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and will be creditable against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability (if any), provided the required information is given to the IRS in a timely manner. If backup
withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a non-U.S. holder may obtain a refund by filing a U.S. federal
income tax return in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors as to
qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption.

Holders of EGC common stock are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the
specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the effect of any federal, state, local, foreign or
other tax laws.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Under Delaware law, holders of shares of EGC common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the merger, but only if those holders comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If
the merger is completed, holders of shares of EGC common stock immediately prior to the effective time who did
not vote in favor of the merger and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. If the
holders of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of EGC common stock properly demand appraisal (and have
complied in all respects with, and have otherwise taken all the steps required by, Section 262 of the DGCL), then
Cox will not be required to consummate the merger.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the
DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in
this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of EGC common stock immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in
shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the
record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to properly demand and
perfect appraisal rights. EGC stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL set
forth in Annex C as well as the information discussed below. If you hold your shares of EGC common stock
through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

Under the DGCL, if the merger is completed, holders of shares of EGC common stock immediately prior to
the effective time who (i) did not cast their vote in favor of the merger; (ii) follow the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL; and (iii) do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of those shares or
otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case, in accordance with the DGCL, will be entitled to have those
shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment of the “fair value” of those shares,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined
by that court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair
value” could be greater than, less than or the same as the merger consideration of  $9.10 per share of EGC
common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, EGC is required, not less than 20 days before the EGC special meeting to
vote on the merger to notify each of the holders of any class or series of its stock who are entitled to appraisal
rights that appraisal rights are available for any or all of those shares, and is required to include in the required
notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes a formal notice of appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of EGC common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights,
or who wishes to preserve that holder’s right to do so, should review the following discussion and Annex C
carefully. Strict compliance with the statutory procedure in Section 262 is required. Failure to timely and
properly comply with the procedures specified will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

Any EGC stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal counsel before
attempting to exercise those rights.

To exercise appraisal rights with respect to your shares of EGC common stock, you must:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Written Demand by the Record Holder

All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc., 1021 Main, Suite
2626 Houston, Texas 77002, Attention: Corporate Secretary. A demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs
EGC of the identity of the EGC stockholder and that the EGC stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of
that EGC stockholder’s shares. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, a proxy or vote against the merger does not
constitute such a demand.

The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the record holder of shares, fully and correctly,
as the holder’s name appears on the certificate(s) for the shares of EGC common stock owned by that holder or in
the stock ledger, and in the case of uncertificated shares, should specify the EGC stockholder’s mailing address
and the number of shares registered in the EGC stockholder’s name. If the shares are owned of record in a
fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in
common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one of two or
more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a holder of record. However, the agent must identify
the record owner(s) and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for
all of the record owner(s).

A beneficial owner of shares of EGC common stock held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights should take those actions that may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is
made by the record holder of the shares. If the shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee
who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for
appraisal of those shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as the record holder. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds
shares through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the
record holder. The beneficial holder of the shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for
appraisal should be made by the record holder of the shares, which may be a central securities depository
nominee if the shares have been so deposited.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation (which, in this case,
will be EGC), or any holder of shares of EGC common stock who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL
and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition
in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all holders
who did not adopt the merger and demanded appraisal of those shares. If no such petition is filed within that 120-
day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of shares who had previously demanded appraisal of their
shares. EGC is under no obligation to, and has no present intention to, file a petition, and holders should not
assume that EGC will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares
of EGC common stock. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of shares to initiate all necessary action to
perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Within 120 days after the effective time, any holder of shares of EGC common stock who has complied with
the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of those
shares. That statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has been received by the
surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,
whichever is later. Notwithstanding the requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of
the record owner of shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of that person, and as to which demand has been properly made and not effectively
withdrawn, may, in that person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation
the statement described in this paragraph.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Upon the filing of a petition for appraisal by any such holder of shares, a copy of the petition must be served
on the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after service to file with the Register in
Chancery of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “Delaware Register in
Chancery”) a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “verified list”) containing the names and addresses of all
EGC stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of
their shares has not been reached.

After notice to the EGC stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery
is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those EGC stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery
may require the EGC stockholders who demanded payment for their shares of EGC common stock to submit
their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation on the certificates of the pendency of the
appraisal proceeding. If any EGC stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to that EGC stockholder. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the
proceedings as to all holders of those shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares of EGC common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of
EGC common stock, or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for the total number of shares of
EGC common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds $1,000,000.

Determination of Fair Value

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which EGC stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery will
determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from
the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each EGC stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of  (a) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of EGC common stock as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and (b) the interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of
Chancery must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and
any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of
the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court stated that that exclusion is a “narrow exclusion that does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from that
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of
future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

EGC stockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of EGC common
stock as so determined could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration and that an
investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration

TABLE OF CONTENTS

payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, “fair
value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although EGC believes that the merger consideration is fair, no
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery. Neither Cox nor EGC anticipates offering more than the merger consideration to any EGC stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and Cox and EGC reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for
purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a share of EGC common stock is less than the merger
consideration.

Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of EGC common stock entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial
upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the EGC stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any EGC
stockholder whose name appears on the verified list and, if that stockholder’s shares are represented by
certificates and if so required, who has submitted that stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register
in Chancery, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that that stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares of EGC
common stock, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the EGC stockholders that is entitled
to the payment. Payment will be so made to each such EGC stockholder upon the surrender to the surviving
corporation of that stockholder’s certificates. The Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in
the Court of Chancery may be enforced.

The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems
equitable. Upon application of an EGC stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by an EGC stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of EGC common stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence
of an order, each party bears its own expenses, including attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts.

Any EGC stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights for shares of EGC common
stock in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective time, be entitled to vote those
shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends
or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of EGC common stock as of a date or time prior to
the effective time.

At any time within 60 days after the effective time, any EGC stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw that stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the merger. After this period, the EGC stockholder may
withdraw its demand for appraisal only with EGC’s consent. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective time, EGC stockholders’ rights to appraisal shall cease, and
all holders of shares of EGC common stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration. Because EGC is
not required file such a petition and does not currently intend to do so, any holder of shares of EGC common
stock who wants a petition for appraisal to be filed should file its own petition on a timely basis. Any EGC
stockholder may withdraw its demand for appraisal by delivering to EGC a written withdrawal of its demand for
appraisal and acceptance of the merger consideration, except that (i) any such attempt to withdraw made more
than 60 days after the effective time will require written approval of EGC and (ii) no appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any EGC stockholder without the approval of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and that approval may be conditioned upon any terms that the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just. However, any EGC stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw its demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered upon the
merger within 60 days after the effective time.

If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of EGC common stock in favor
of the merger, and you must comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take
any required step in connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it will result in the termination or waiver of
your appraisal rights.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

It is not expected that EGC will hold an annual meeting for 2019 unless the merger is not completed. If the
merger is not completed, EGC’s stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in EGC
stockholder meetings.

EGC stockholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for stockholder action at meetings of EGC
stockholders in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. To be submitted for inclusion in the proxy
statement for the 2019 annual meeting, stockholder proposals must have satisfied all applicable requirements of
Rule 14a-8 and must have been received by the Corporate Secretary of EGC no later than the close of business on
December 13, 2018. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to require EGC to include in its proxy statement
and proxy relating to the 2019 annual meeting any stockholder proposal that may be omitted from the proxy
materials of EGC under applicable regulations of the Exchange Act in effect at the time such proposal is received.

Any stockholder proposals received outside of the Rule 14a-8 procedure for consideration at the EGC’s
2019 annual meeting must have been delivered to the Corporate Secretary of the EGC no later than February 16,
2019, but no earlier than January 17, 2019. If, however, the date of the 2019 annual meeting is changed by more
than 30 days from the anniversary date of EGC’s 2018 annual meeting, the stockholder notice described above
will be deemed timely if it is received not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of  (i) the 60th day prior to such annual meeting and
(ii) the 10th day after public announcement of the date of such meeting. For special meetings, an EGC
stockholder must submit notice of a proposal no earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting and no
later than the close of business on the later of  (i) the 60th day prior to such special meeting and (ii) the 10th day
following public announcement of such meeting. If timely notice of a stockholder proposal is not given, the
proposal may not be brought by the proposing EGC stockholder or any other person. If timely notice is given but
is not accompanied by a written statement to the extent required by applicable securities laws, the EGC may
exercise discretionary voting authority over proxies with respect to such proposal, if presented at the meeting.

In addition to the timely notice requirements, an EGC stockholder’s proposal for nominees for directors
must comply with Section 2.12 of EGC’s Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, as further amended and
supplemented (the “EGC bylaws”). Stockholder proposals related to other business must comply with
Section 2.11 of the EGC bylaws. Furthermore, any stockholder proposal must comply with all applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy
the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing an address by
delivering a single proxy statement that is addressed to those stockholders, unless contrary instructions have been
received. This procedure, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” reduces the amount of duplicate
information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs for companies.

Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of our common stock held
through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding our common stock, you may have already
received a householding notification from your broker. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to
household, and thereby receive multiple copies of proxy materials. If you wish to opt out of this procedure and
receive a separate set of proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to
receive only one, you should contact your broker, trustee or other nominee or EGC at the address and telephone
number below. A separate copy of these proxy materials will be promptly delivered upon request by contacting
MacKenzie at 1407 Broadway, 27th Floor, New York, NY 10018 or by telephone at (800) 322-2885 (toll-free) or
(212) 929-5500 (collect call).

1.2    Closing.    The Closing shall take place at 9:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on a date that is the second

Parent and the Company may agree upon in writing.

1.3    Effect of the Merger.    At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1.1

death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation and the
Surviving Corporation Bylaws.

ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

2.1    Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any party or the holder of any of their securities:

(a)    Capital Stock of Merger Sub.    Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall represent one share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that, immediately after the Effective Time,
CEXXI, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Holdco”), shall
directly be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation’s capital stock.

(b)    Cancellation of Excluded Shares.    Any shares of Company Common Stock held immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (A) the Company, as treasury shares, or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) by
Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the
“Excluded Shares”), in each case, shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective
Time and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

(c)    Conversion of Capital Stock of the Company.    Subject to the other provisions of this Article II,
each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Company Common Stock”),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares and any
Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $9.10 in cash
without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).

(d)    Cancellation of Converted Company Common Stock.    All shares of Company Common Stock
shall, when so converted, cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist.
Each holder of a certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.5.

(e)    Impact of Stock Splits, etc.    In the event of any change in the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time by
reason of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common
Stock and RSU Consideration to be paid for each Company RSU as provided in this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.

2.2    Appraisal Rights.    Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, any shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, and has otherwise taken all
of the steps required by, Section 262 of the DGCL to properly perfect such stockholder’s appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (“Appraisal Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and instead shall be cancelled and shall be entitled to receive the amount determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that in the event that a stockholder of the Company fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal under

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Section 262 of the DGCL, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder shall be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c). The Company
shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any written notices to exercise appraisal rights in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company with respect to stockholders’ appraisal rights, and (y) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
payment of fair value under the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment of fair
value under the DGCL.

2.3    Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a)    At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each restricted stock
unit outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not subject to service-based or performance-based
vesting conditions (each, a “Company RSU”), granted pursuant to the Company’s 2016 Long Term
Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or the 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time
to time (such plans, collectively, the “Company Stock Plans” and each a “Company Stock Plan”), shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, with the
performance conditions deemed achieved at target, and be cancelled, and, subject to Section 2.3(d), shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU, less applicable Taxes to be withheld (the “RSU
Consideration”) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 30 days, after the Effective
Time (or such later date as required by Section 409A of the Code).

(b)    At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option for the purchase of
Company Common Stock issued pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (a “Company Stock Option”),
regardless of whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any
action on the part of any holder of any holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration and the holder shall
have no further rights with respect to such Company Stock Option.

(c)    Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary such that, effective as of
the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU and Company Stock Option (each a “Company Equity
Award” and together, the “Company Equity Awards”) shall be cancelled as contemplated by this Section 2.3,
including (i) obtaining any consents from holders of Company Equity Awards that are required under the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, and (ii) amending, to the extent necessary and to the extent
such amendment is permitted by the terms of such Company Equity Award or Company Stock Plan, the
terms of such Company Equity Awards or Company Stock Plan to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.3.

(d)    All payments with respect to the Company RSUs shall be made through the Surviving
Corporation’s payroll system, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Company RSU pursuant to this Agreement any
amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable
Law, including Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so properly deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company RSU in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 in
respect of any Company RSU.

2.4    Warrants.    Because the Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) is greater than the
Merger Consideration, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Warrant, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the part of any holder of any Warrant, will be cancelled for
no consideration.

2.5    Payment; Surrender of Shares.

(a)    Paying Agent; Exchange Fund.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a national bank
or trust company, which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) to

receive the cash necessary to make the cash payments contemplated by Section 2.1(c). Promptly after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a
separate account for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock (the “Exchange Fund”) the
aggregate cash to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(c). If for
any reason the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations
to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit cash into the
Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy
such payment obligations.

(b) Exchange Procedures.

(i)    As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than five
Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate formerly representing a share of Company Common Stock
(“Certificates”) or any corresponding book-entry share of Company Common Stock (“Book-Entry
Share”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures
set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and such Letter of Transmittal will be in customary form) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter until the first anniversary of the Effective Time
surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, as agent for such holder, under
cover of the Letter of Transmittal. Upon delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal and the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash or a check in an amount
equal to the amount such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. Until so surrendered,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other Excluded Shares) will represent solely the right to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(ii)    If all or any portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled shares of Company
Common Stock is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered Certificates
are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that (A) the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that (B) the Person requesting
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the relevant
surrendered Certificates are registered, shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of such payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax
is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II, will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares theretofore represented by such Certificates.

(iii)    At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will
not be any further registration of transfers of any shares of the Company Common Stock thereafter on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded
Shares) are presented to the Surviving Corporation,

they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. No
interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares that immediately before the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock.

(iv)    Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash, including any interest
received with respect to such cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
Merger and the other Transactions, which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of Parent or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(v)    Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from cash amounts payable
under this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid
over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

(vi)    If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any action that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this Article II.

2.6    Withholding Taxes.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Laws. If the applicable withholding agent
determines that deduction or withholding is required pursuant to this Section 2.6, it shall give reasonable prior
notice of any amount to be deducted or withheld to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding
would be made. The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, to minimize or eliminate to the extent permissible under applicable Laws the amount of any
such deduction or withholding. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
paid to the applicable Governmental Authority on behalf of the Person from whom deducted or withheld and, to
the extent so paid, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

3.1    Representations and Warranties of the Company.    Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents filed and publicly available at least 24 hours prior to the date hereof  (excluding any disclosures set
forth in any such Company SEC Documents in any risk factor section, any forward-looking disclosure in any
section relating to forward-looking statements to the extent that they are non-specific, predictive or primarily
cautionary in nature, in each such case, other than historical facts included therein), where the relevance of the
information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure or (ii) as set forth on the correspondingly numbered disclosure schedule dated as of
the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the date of this
Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Schedule”), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

(a)    Organization, Standing and Power.    Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is (i) a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, duly organized or incorporated, as
the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company, as applicable, power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted,
and (iii) is duly qualified and in good standing to do business (including, EGC and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, having those qualifications with the BOEM necessary for EGC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to carry on its business in the Gulf of Mexico in the Ordinary Course of Business) in each
jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties
makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or be in
good standing would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as well as the equivalent organizational
documents of each Subsidiary, in each case as of the date hereof. The respective jurisdictions of
incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary of the Company are identified on Schedule 3.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

consists of  (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Company Preferred Stock,” and, together with the Company Common
Stock and any other capital stock of the Company, the “Company Capital Stock”). At the close of business
on June 14, 2018 (the “Capitalization Reference Date”), (A) 33,395,301 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, (B) no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (C) 3,530,773
shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, of

outstanding Company RSUs (assuming maximum payout for any Company RSUs subject to performance-
based vesting conditions) and (2) 285,105 shares of Common Stock were subject to issuance upon the
vesting of outstanding Company Stock Options (the exercise price per share for each of which options is
greater than the Merger Consideration), (D) 2,119,889 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of 2,119,889 Warrants (the exercise price per share for each of which Warrants is
greater than the Merger Consideration), and (E) no Voting Debt was issued and outstanding. All outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to
any preemptive rights. Schedule 3.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
Capitalization Reference Date, all outstanding options, warrants, rights (including preemptive rights), and
Contracts to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which it is bound in any
case obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, deliver, sell, purchase, redeem or
acquire, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, additional shares of
Company Capital Stock or any Voting Debt, or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
to grant, extend or enter into any such option,

Section 3.1(b) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the corresponding Schedules) and except for changes
since the Capitalization Reference Date resulting from the grant, exercise or vesting of Company Equity
Awards granted in accordance with Section 4.1(b), (1) there are no outstanding shares of Company Capital

any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no stockholder agreements, voting
trusts or other Contracts to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound relating to the voting of
any shares of Company Capital Stock. Schedule 3.1(b)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list of the capitalization and schedule of stockholders of each Subsidiary of the
Company. The Company has no joint venture or other similar material equity interests in any Person or

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material Indebtedness other than intercompany indebtedness
owed to the Company or one of its wholly owned Subsidiaries.

the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, subject, with respect to the consummation of the Transactions, to the Company Stockholder
Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights and to general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law (collectively, “Creditor’s
Rights”). The Company Board has (i) resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt
this Agreement (the “Company Board Recommendation”), (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
Merger are in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders, (iii) approved this Agreement and the
Merger, and (iv) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has made all certifications and statements
required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Documents. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to
any of the Company SEC Documents. None of the Company’s Subsidiaries is subject to the reporting
requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

(ii)    The financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents,
including all notes and schedules thereto (the “Company Financial Statements”), complied as to form in
all material respects with Regulation S-X of the SEC, were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) and fairly present in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end
adjustments) the financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of their
respective dates and the results of operations and the cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein. Ernst & Young LLP (“E&Y”) is an independent public
accounting firm with respect to the Company and has not resigned or been dismissed as independent
public accountants of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, the independence of E&Y
with respect to the Company has not been challenged or questioned by any Person.

(f)    Corporate Governance.

(i)    As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has disclosed to the Company’s auditors and
the Company Board’s audit committee (A) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
its consolidated financial information and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or
permitted to remain outstanding any “extensions of credit” (within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii)    The Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and are maintaining
“disclosure controls and procedures” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). The disclosure controls and procedures as in effect as of the date of this Agreement
are effective (A) to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries is
made known to the Company’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act are being prepared; and (B) in timely alerting the Company’s principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to material information required to be included in the Company’s
reports required under the Exchange Act.

(g)    Proxy Statement.    None of the information contained in the Proxy Statement will, at the date
mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting (as such Proxy
Statement shall have been amended or supplemented as of the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting),
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein

Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company
Reserve Report was, as of the time provided, accurate except for such accuracies as, individually or in

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The estimates of proved oil and gas reserves provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to NSAI in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Report complied in

actions, the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal is, or could reasonably

terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) if prior to taking such action (A) the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel that such Competing Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent in response to such
Competing Proposal), and (B) the Company shall have given notice to Parent that the Company has
received such proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and, that the
Company intends to take such action, and either (1) Parent shall not have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the second Business Day after the date on which such notice is
given to Parent, or (2) if Parent within the period described in the foregoing clause (1) shall have
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company, the Company Board (or any committee thereof), after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith
that the Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal with respect to Parent’s revised proposal;
provided, however, that each time material modifications to the financial terms of a Competing
Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal are made the time period set forth in this clause (B) prior
to which the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be
extended for 24 hours after notification of such change to Parent; and

(iv)    prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, seek clarification from (but not
engage in negotiations with or provide non-public information to) any Person that has made a
Competing Proposal solely to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to
provide adequate information for the Company Board or any committee thereof to make an informed
determination under Section 4.3(b)(ii).

(c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) shall be permitted, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to effect a
Change of Recommendation if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under
applicable Law.

(d)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) any factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Company’s receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation

discussions or negotiations with the Company or a Representative of the Company relating to a Competing
Proposal (in each case within two Business Days thereof), and the Company shall provide to Parent (within
such two Business Day time frame) either (i) a copy of any such Competing Proposal made in writing
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such
Competing Proposal.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

5.1    Access to Information.    The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers,
key employees, agents, properties (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ Oil
and Gas Properties), offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records,
contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as reasonably
practicable to Parent and its Representatives such information concerning the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’
business, properties (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ Oil and Gas
Properties), contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf
of the Parent. Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any
unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall not be required to, or to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to Parent or any of its Representatives to the
extent that such information is subject to an attorney-client or attorney work-product privilege (other than title
opinions relating to the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ Oil and Gas Properties) or that such access or the
furnishing of such information is prohibited by Law or existing contract or agreement; (ii) Parent shall not have
access to personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual medical histories,
individual performance or evaluation records, or other information the disclosure of which could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of significant liability and (iii) Parent shall not be permitted to conduct
any sampling or analysis of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of the Company or its
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company (granted or withheld in its sole discretion). Parent
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.1 for any purpose unrelated to the Transactions. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and, subject to Section 7.2, shall apply to all information furnished
thereunder or hereunder.

5.2    Preparation of Proxy Statement.    Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement, including all amendments or supplements
to the preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy
Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than 30 days following the date of this
Agreement). No filing of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without Parent’s
prior written consent (which shall not be reasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company shall notify Parent of the receipt
of any comments of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Parent, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, copies of all written correspondence between the Company or any Representative of the
Company and the SEC with respect to the preliminary or definitive Proxy Statement. If any comments are
received from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall respond as promptly
as reasonably practicable to such comments. Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide the
Company with such information as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement or as may be
reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC. As promptly as reasonably practicable after all
comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC and all information required to be contained in
the Proxy Statement has been included therein, the Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the
SEC and cause such definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed (including by electronic delivery if permitted) to its
stockholders of record, as of a record date reasonably established by the Company Board in accordance with
applicable Law.

5.3    Company Stockholders Meeting.

Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws to duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,

Except as permitted by Section 4.3(c), (A) the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the

Agreement, and (B) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board
made the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders
any Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the

Company’s stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than 20 Business Days after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled
(it being understood that such Company Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) exist, and such Company Stockholders
Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clause (ii)
exist); and provided further that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to
a date on or after two Business Days prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date no later than the second
Business Day after the expiration of any of the periods contemplated by Section 4.3(b)(iii)(B).

use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including (i) the
obtaining of all required Consents and the taking of all commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain a required Consent from any Governmental Authority; (ii) the obtaining of all consents from (A)
any third Persons as reasonably requested by Parent and (B) the Persons set forth on Schedule 5.4(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, including the exercise or use, upon the reasonable request by Parent, by the
Company of all rights and remedies necessary or available under the Contract under which the consent is
sought (but excluding the initiation of any Proceeding unless Parent and the Company mutually agree), to
procure the waivers or consents to assignment set forth in such Schedule 5.4(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining the consents
referred to in clauses (A) and (B), (1) the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,

required prior to the Closing to pay or commit to pay to any Person whose consent is being solicited any

minimis liability due to such Person in connection therewith); and (iii) the execution and delivery of any

(b)    As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall
make all premerger notification filings required under (i) the HSR Act (which shall be made no later than 15
Business Days after the date hereof) and (ii) the jurisdictions outside of the United States in which the
Antitrust Laws require a notification to an Antitrust Authority identified in Schedule 5.4(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule (together with the HSR Act, the “Merger Notification Rules”) and request early
termination of the applicable waiting periods thereunder. Parent and the Company shall each pay one-half of
all filing fees under the Merger Notification Rules. Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) cooperate
fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under the Merger
Notification Rules; (B) keep the other party reasonably informed of, and provide copies of, any
correspondence, submission, proposal, presentation, filing or communication received by such party from,
or given by such party to, any Antitrust Authority, or received or given in connection with any Proceeding
by a private Person; and (C) permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, and incorporate the other party’s reasonable comments
in, any correspondence, submission, proposal, presentation, filing or communication given by it to any
Antitrust Authority or in connection with any Proceeding by a private Person related to any Antitrust Law
with any other Person, in each case regarding the Merger and in a manner that protects attorney-client or
attorney work-product privilege; provided, however, that materials may be redacted to remove references to
valuation of Company Capital Stock, as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and applicable
Laws and as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client, work-product or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Unless otherwise agreed and without limiting the obligations stated in this
Section 5.4(b), Parent and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt
expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Merger Notification Rules and obtain Consent by any
relevant Antitrust Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable. Further, without limiting the obligations
stated in this Section 5.4(b), Parent and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond promptly to and substantially comply with any request for information regarding the Merger or
filings under any Merger Notification Rules from any Antitrust Authority. Neither party shall initiate, or
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to any filings,
applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger or filings under any Merger Notification
Rules, or enter into any agreements with any Governmental Authority, without giving the other party
reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the request of either party, may
be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). The parties shall consult with each other prior to taking any
material substantive position with respect to the filings under the Merger Notification Rules or in any written
submission to or discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so as to require a party, or any of its
respective Affiliates, without its written consent, to (i) sell, license, dispose of, hold separate or operate in
any specified manner any of its respective assets or businesses (or to discuss, agree or commit to any of the
foregoing), (ii) enter into any consent decree, Order or agreement that alters its business or commercial
practices in any way or that in any way limits or could reasonably be expected to limit the right of Parent to
own, operate or retain all or any portion of the Parent’s or the Company’s assets, properties or businesses,
the Company Capital Stock or the Parent’s freedom of action with respect thereto or to otherwise receive the
full benefits of this Agreement, (iii) contest, resist or defend any Proceeding instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by any Governmental Authority or other Person challenging this Agreement or the Transactions
as violating any applicable Law or (iv) have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or any Law that is effect and that
enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Transactions. The obligations
of each party under this Section 5.4 to use commercially reasonable efforts shall be limited to compliance

have any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub (in the case of a Party Affiliate of the Company) or to the
Company (in the case of a Party Affiliate of Parent) of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under this
Agreement or the Transactions, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive and release all claims of any such

of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages (but only to the
extent expressly permitted by Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.3) to seek and obtain in the courts contemplated by
Section 8.7, (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party further
agrees not to assert that any of the foregoing remedies is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to object to such a remedy on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an

would not enter into this Agreement.

be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto; (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;

The Board of Directors 
of Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. 
1021 Main Street, Suite 2626 
Houston, TX 77002

Members of the Board of Directors of Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc.:

We understand that MLCJR, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Cox”), and YHIMONE, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cox (“Merger Sub”), and Energy XXI Gulf
Coast, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Merger Agreement”), which provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the “Transaction”), pursuant to which each share common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per
share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(excluding the Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) shall be converted into the right to receive
$9.10 in cash without interest (the “Subject Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are set
forth in more detail in the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company has asked us whether, in our opinion, as of the date
hereof, the Subject Consideration in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s
stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox).

In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:

(ix) discussed past and current operations, current financial condition and financial projections of the
Company with management of the Company (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of
achieving the projections set forth in the forecasts provided by management of the Company);

(x) performed discounted cash flow analyses based on forecasts related to the Company and data
provided by management of the Company;

(xi) reviewed the financial metrics of certain historical transactions that we deemed relevant and
compared such financial metrics to those implied by the Transaction;

(xii) reviewed and analyzed publicly available historical and current financial information, stock price
data, and public consensus estimates with respect to certain public companies with operations and
assets that we considered comparable to the Company; and

(xiii) conducted such other studies and investigations, performed such other analyses and examinations,
reviewed such other information and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate for
purposes of providing the opinion expressed herein.

For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness
of all of the foregoing information and any other financial, accounting, legal, operational, reserves, tax or other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by us, and we have not assumed any responsibility for
independent verification of the accuracy or completeness of any such information. We have further relied upon
the assurances of management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts that would make such
information inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. With respect to financial forecasts and projections of the
Company, we have relied, with your consent, upon the assurances of the Company’s management that such data
has been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments
of the Company’s management as to the future financial performance of the Company, under the assumptions
reflected therein. We express no view as to such financial forecasts or any judgments, estimates or assumptions
on which they are based.

We have relied, at the direction of the Company’s management and the Board, upon the assessments of
management of the Company as to (i) the potential impact on the Company of market and other trends and
prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the oil and
gas industry, including commodity pricing and supply and demand for oil and gas, (ii) the potential impact on the
operations, results and prospects on the Company of the Transaction, and (iii) existing and future contracts and
relationships, agreements and arrangements with third parties that are necessary or desirable for the operation of
the Company. We have undertaken no independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action,
possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which the Company is or may be a party or is or may
be subject. We also assumed that there were no material changes in the liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, business or prospects of or relating to the Company since the date of the latest information relating to
the Company made available to us. We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of
the Company and have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Company, the potential realization of the value of the Company or the solvency or fair value of the Company or
any of the potential parties to the Transaction under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar matters, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Estimates of values of
companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets
may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, we assume no responsibility
for their accuracy.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis and with your consent,
that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that
each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger
Agreement and that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms described in the Merger Agreement, in
each case in the draft form reviewed by us, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or
conditions contained therein. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or
releases, and any financing, necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any
material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the parties to the
Transaction, their equity holders or the consummation of the Transaction or materially reduce the benefits of the
Transaction to the Company. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that
complies with all applicable federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations. We have assumed that the
Company and the Board have relied upon the advice of their counsel, independent accountants, reserve engineers
and other advisors (other than Intrepid Partners, LLC) as to all legal, financial reporting, reserves, tax, accounting
and regulatory matters with respect to the Company, the Merger Agreement and the Transaction. We have
assumed that the final executed and delivered versions of all documents reviewed by us in draft form will
conform in all material respects to the drafts reviewed by us.

We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Subject Consideration to be received by the Company’s
stockholders (other than stockholders who are affiliates of Cox) in the Transaction. We have not been asked to,
nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other terms, conditions, aspects or
implications of the Transaction or any agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into in connection
therewith or otherwise, including the structure or timing of the Transaction and the covenants of the Company
under the Merger Agreement. Our opinion does not address any financing transactions associated with the
Transaction. In addition, we do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness (financial
or otherwise) of the Transaction to any individual subsidiary of the Company or the creditors, bondholders or
other constituencies of the Company (other than the Company’s stockholders, as described above) or its
subsidiaries, or the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to,
the compensation to be paid to any officers, directors or employees or any parties to the Transaction, or any class
of such persons, whether relative to the Subject Consideration or otherwise. Our opinion does not address the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the
Company might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction.

We do not express any opinion as to equity securities or debt securities of the Company or Cox and the
price, trading range or volume at which any securities will trade at any time. Our opinion does not address
whether Cox or Merger Sub has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to
consummate the Transaction. Our opinion does not address accounting, legal, actuarial, regulatory, reserves or tax
matters. We are not legal, tax or bankruptcy advisors. Our opinion does not constitute a solvency opinion and
does not address the solvency or financial condition of the Company or any of the potential parties to the
Transaction. Our opinion expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability relating to counterparty credit risk,
and our opinion assumes that, for purposes of our opinion, each of the Company and the counterparties to the
Transaction (including Cox and Merger Sub) is and will continue to be a solvent going concern with a stable and
sound financial condition.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board in connection with an evaluation of the Transaction. In
connection with our services, we will receive a fee in connection with the delivery of this opinion, which fee is
not contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. The Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our
expenses for this opinion and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We and our
affiliates in the past have and currently are providing services to the Company unrelated to the Transaction, for
which services we and such affiliates have received compensation, including a fee payable upon consummation
of the Transaction.

surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available
for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are
required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of
stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by
more than 2,000 holders;

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be
submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such
meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to
shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that
appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of  § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote
against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take
such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each
stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has
become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title,
then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class
or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of
the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of  § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in
writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying
each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to
appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective
date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this

shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or
consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or
“surviving or resulting corporation.”

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation
or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the
Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as
a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor
of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder
within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal
under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section,
a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the
statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value
of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The
Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing
of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by
the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class
or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a
national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%
of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for

title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares
in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer
agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in
the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining
the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a
record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the
notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record
date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall
accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each
such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.
The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether
such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems
equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation
a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in
subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not
affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to
