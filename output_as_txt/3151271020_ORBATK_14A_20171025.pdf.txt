ORBITAL ATK, INC.
45101 Warp Drive
Dulles, VA 20166 

October 24, 2017

Dear Stockholders:

        On September 17, 2017, Orbital ATK, Inc. ("Orbital ATK") and Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop Grumman") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as
it may be amended from time to time, the "merger agreement"), providing for the acquisition of Orbital ATK by Northrop Grumman. Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman will be merged with and into Orbital ATK, with Orbital ATK surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Northrop Grumman (the "merger").

        If the merger is completed, stockholders will have the right to receive $134.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Orbital ATK ("common stock") that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

        You are cordially invited to a special meeting of the stockholders (the "special meeting") to be held at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166 on November 29, 2017, at
9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The special meeting is being held for you to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and related matters. Your vote is
important. Whether or not you expect to attend the meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible in order to make certain
that you are represented at the meeting. You may vote over the Internet, as well as by telephone or by mailing a proxy or voting instruction card. If you are a "street
name" holder (a holder whose shares are held through a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee), in order for your shares to be represented at the special
meeting, you must instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee as to how to vote your shares by following the directions provided to you by your
broker, bank, trust company or other nominee. The merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the record date. Therefore, your failure to vote, or failure to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other
nominee to vote, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger.

        After careful consideration, the Orbital ATK board of directors (the "Orbital ATK Board"), on September 16, 2017, unanimously approved the merger agreement
and determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and to
effect the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Orbital ATK Board accordingly unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption
of the merger agreement and the other proposals described in the accompanying proxy statement.

        The obligations of Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions set forth in the merger
agreement. The accompanying proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger and other important
information related to the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement. We encourage you to read the accompanying
proxy statement and the merger agreement carefully and in their entirety.

        Thank you in advance for your consideration of this matter and continued support.

        Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the merger agreement, passed upon the
merits or fairness of the merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the accompanying proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

        The accompanying proxy statement is dated October 24, 2017, and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about October 27, 2017.

Sincerely,   
 

Ronald R. Fogleman
Chairman of the Board

of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Your vote is important. Whether or not you expect to attend the
meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible in order to make certain that you are represented at the meeting. You may
submit your proxy over the Internet, as well as by telephone or by mailing a proxy or voting instruction card. If you are a "street name" holder (a holder whose shares

nominee. If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., toll-free at (800) 399-1581.

        If you return a properly executed proxy (including proxies received via the Internet or by telephone), but do not indicate how you wish to vote on a proposal, your shares of
common stock represented by such proxy will be voted "FOR" any such proposal. If you attend the special meeting, you may revoke your proxy and vote in person if you wish,
even if you have previously returned your proxy card or submitted your proxy by telephone or the Internet.

        Please note that if you hold shares in different accounts, it is important that you vote the shares represented by each account.

        The accompanying proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger and other important information related to
the merger. We urge you to read the accompanying proxy statement and the annexes carefully and in their entirety.

        Under Delaware law, Orbital ATK stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their
shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery instead of receiving the merger consideration, but only if the merger is completed and they comply fully with all
applicable requirements of Delaware law, which are summarized in the accompanying proxy statement.

        If you fail to return your proxy or to attend the special meeting in person, your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. If you mark your proxy to abstain or provide voting
instructions to abstain, your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a
vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum and will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        After careful consideration, the Orbital ATK Board of Directors, on September 16, 2017, unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that it is
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and to effect the merger and the

        This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and may not contain all the information that is important to you. We urge you to read
carefully the remainder of this proxy statement, including the attached annexes and the documents referred to in this proxy statement, because this summary does not provide all

        All references to "Orbital ATK," "we," "us," or "our" in this proxy statement refer to Orbital ATK, Inc., a Delaware corporation; all references in this proxy statement to

wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman; all references to the "merger" refer to the merger of Sub with and into Orbital ATK, with Orbital ATK surviving as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman; and, unless otherwise indicated or as the context requires, all references to the "merger agreement" refer to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of September 17, 2017, as it may be amended from time to time, by and among Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman and Sub, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement. Orbital ATK, with respect to its existence after the effective time of the merger, is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement as the "surviving

Northrop Grumman conducts most of its business with the U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense and intelligence community. Northrop Grumman also
conducts business with foreign, state and local governments, as well as commercial customers.

        Northrop Grumman's principal executive offices are located at 2980 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, VA 22042 and its telephone number is (703) 280-2900. Northrop
Grumman's common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol "NOC."

Neptune Merger, Inc. (see page 25) 

        Neptune Merger, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, is a Delaware corporation that was formed on September 15, 2017 for the purpose of effecting the
merger. Sub has not engaged in any business to date except for activities incidental to its incorporation and activities undertaken in connection with the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Sub will be merged with and into Orbital ATK, with
Orbital ATK surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.

        The principal executive offices of Sub are located at 2980 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, VA 22042, and its telephone number is (703) 280-2900.

The Merger 

        A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. We encourage you to read the entire merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the principal document governing the merger. For more information about the merger agreement, see "The Merger
Agreement" beginning on page 67.

The Merger (see page 27) 

        If the merger is completed, at the effective time of the merger, Sub will be merged with and into Orbital ATK. Orbital ATK will survive the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. We intend to complete the merger as soon as reasonably practicable and currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2018. The
merger is subject to regulatory clearances and other conditions, in addition to the approval of the stockholders of Orbital ATK at the special meeting. It is possible that factors
outside the control of Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman could result in the merger being completed at a later time or not at all.

Merger Consideration (see page 67) 

        Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and will be converted into the
right to receive $134.50 in cash, without interest (the "merger consideration") and less any required withholding taxes (other than (i) shares of common stock where the holder
has properly exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") (and has not withdrawn such exercise or lost such rights) and
(ii) shares of common stock owned by Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman or Sub (collectively, "excluded shares")).

Appraisal Rights (see page 88) 

        Shares of common stock held by stockholders who have properly exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (and have not withdrawn such exercise or lost
such rights) will not be

converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, but will instead be converted into the right to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of common
stock as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of common stock as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL may be
more or less than (or the same as) the merger consideration. Stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights must comply fully with all applicable requirements of Section 262
of the DGCL, which is summarized in this proxy statement and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262
of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your
appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek the advice of your own legal counsel.

The Special Meeting (see page 19) 

        The special meeting of stockholders is scheduled to be held at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166 on November 29, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The special meeting
is being held in order to consider and vote on the following:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, pursuant to which Sub will be merged with and into
Orbital ATK, with Orbital ATK surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, and Orbital ATK stockholders will be entitled to
receive $134.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that they own immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (referred to as the "merger proposal"); 

• a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation that will or may be paid to Orbital ATK's named executive officers in connection with the merger
(referred to as the "compensation proposal"); and 

• a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal
(referred to as the "adjournment proposal").

        Only holders of record of common stock at the close of business on October 10, 2017, the record date for the special meeting ("record date"), are entitled to notice of, and to
vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 57,646,130 shares of common stock were
issued and outstanding.

        A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Holders of a majority of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date and
entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting in order for there to be a quorum. Shares of common stock
represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an "abstention" from voting, will be counted as present for purposes of
establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Shares of common stock held in treasury will not be included in
the calculation of the number of shares of common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. If a quorum is not present
in person or represented by proxy, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of common stock required to constitute a quorum
are present in person or represented by proxy.

        You may cast one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting for each share of common stock you own at the close of business on the record date. The
merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the record date. The compensation
proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the special meeting and
entitled to vote thereon.

        Your failure to vote, or failure to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal, but,
assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have no effect on the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of the Orbital ATK Board (see page 39) 

        After careful consideration, the Orbital ATK board of directors (the "Orbital ATK Board"), on September 16, 2017, unanimously approved the merger agreement and
determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and effect the merger and
the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement. The
Orbital ATK Board considered many factors in reaching its conclusion, including, without limitation, the value that stockholders would realize in the merger, the current and
historical market prices of Orbital ATK shares relative to the $134.50 per share merger consideration, the fact that the merger consideration consists entirely of cash and the risks
associated with the implementation of Orbital ATK's business plan. See "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 39.

        The Orbital ATK Board also unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Financial Advisor (see page 43) 

        In connection with the merger, Orbital ATK's financial advisor, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("Citigroup"), delivered a written opinion, dated September 16, 2017, to the
Orbital ATK Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the $134.50 in cash per share merger consideration to be received in the
merger by holders of common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of Citigroup's written opinion, dated September 16, 2017, which
describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of Citigroup's opinion set forth under "The Merger—Opinion of Financial Advisor" beginning on page 43 is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Citigroup's opinion. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. Citigroup's opinion was provided for the
information of the Orbital ATK Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the per share merger consideration from a financial point of view
and did not address any other aspects or implications of the merger. Citigroup was not requested to consider, and its opinion did not address, the underlying business
decision of Orbital ATK to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for Orbital ATK or
the effect of any other transaction in which Orbital ATK might engage. Citigroup's opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating the proposed merger or otherwise.

        Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase common stock that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price applicable to such option, less any applicable tax withholding. If the exercise price applicable to
shares of common stock subject to an option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the option shall terminate and be canceled for no consideration.

        Restricted Shares.    Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each restricted share that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Performance Shares.    If the closing date occurs prior to the date on which performance shares with respect to the 2015-2017 performance period would vest in the ordinary
course of business, such performance shares will become vested based on achievement of performance metrics at the greater of target performance or actual performance and will
be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such performance share immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above), and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax
withholding.

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is
held by an individual who is not a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans or who waives participation in Orbital ATK's income security plans prior to the
effective time of the merger, will become vested based on deemed achievement of target performance, pro-rated based on the number of days elapsed from the beginning of the
performance period through and including the closing date over the total number of days from the beginning of the performance period through the end of the scheduled
performance period. Such performance shares will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (after taking into account the vesting at target in connection with the merger described above),
and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. For each performance share that is forfeited due to pro-ration, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the effective time of the merger, Northrop Grumman will grant each holder thereof who is an employee of Northrop Grumman as of the grant date with a "Northrop Grumman
retention grant" of Northrop Grumman restricted stock rights with a value equal to two times the value of such forfeited performance share (determined based on target
performance) that will time vest and not be dependent on the achievement of any performance metrics. One-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on March 1,
2019, and the remaining one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on March 1, 2020, in each case subject to continued employment with Northrop Grumman
and its subsidiaries as of such dates; provided, however, that holders of Northrop Grumman retention grants who are involuntarily terminated other than for cause prior to
March 1, 2019 will vest in one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant upon such termination and forfeit the remaining one-half.

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is
held by an individual who is a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans and who does not waive participation therein prior to the effective time, will become
vested based on deemed achievement of target performance and will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
common stock subject to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above),
and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Deferred Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each deferred stock unit that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such deferred stock unit immediately prior to the effective time, and
(ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. Such payment will be paid in accordance with and subject to the deferral elections applicable to such deferred
stock units as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Phantom Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each phantom stock unit that is outstanding will become fully vested and will be converted into the right to
receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such phantom stock unit immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) the
merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. Such payment will be paid in accordance with and subject to the deferral elections applicable to such phantom stock
units as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Notwithstanding the above, if any options, restricted shares, performance shares or deferred stock units are granted following the date of the merger agreement and prior to
the effective time of the merger, the vesting of such awards will instead be pro-rated based on the number of days from the grant date (or for performance shares, from the
beginning of the performance period) through and including the closing date over the number of days from the grant date through the final regularly scheduled vesting date of
such award (or for performance shares, from the beginning to the end of the performance period).

        An individual who is a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans and who does not waive participation therein prior to the effective time of the merger has
certain rights as provided in the applicable income security plan. The terms of the merger agreement do not alter the participant's rights under the income security plans. See "The
Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Change in Control Severance" beginning on page 58 and "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity
Awards" beginning on page 68.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 51) 

        In considering the recommendation of the Orbital ATK Board that our stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, stockholders should be aware that our directors and
executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally and that may present actual or potential
conflicts of interest. The Orbital ATK Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the
merger, in approving the merger agreement and in recommending to stockholders the approval of the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.
These interests include the following:

• Each of Orbital ATK's directors and executive officers holds outstanding equity awards and pursuant to the merger agreement will receive both accelerated vesting
thereof and cash payments with respect thereto in connection with the merger. For more information regarding the treatment of outstanding Orbital ATK equity-
based awards in the merger, see "The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity Awards" beginning on page 52. 

• Each of Orbital ATK's executive officers participates in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans, which plans provide for severance payments and benefits
upon a "qualifying termination" in connection with a change in control of Orbital ATK. Generally, a "qualifying termination" is an involuntary termination of
employment without "cause" or a voluntary termination of employment for "good reason," in each case, after or in anticipation of a "change in control" (as such
terms are defined in the applicable income security plan). For more information regarding the severance triggers and entitlements of each executive officer, see
"The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Change in Control Severance" beginning on page 58. 

• Orbital ATK's directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

        For more information and quantification of these interests, please see "The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 51.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 85) 

        The merger will generally be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders of our common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, each of our stockholders who is a
U.S. holder whose shares of common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. In general, each of
our stockholders who is a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the non-U.S. holder's receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger unless the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to tax under non-U.S. federal income
tax laws.

        You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 85 for a more detailed discussion of the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You
are encouraged to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

No Financing Condition; Financing (see page 65) 

        The merger is not subject to a financing condition. Northrop Grumman has represented that it will have on the closing date sufficient funds available through credit
arrangements or otherwise to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees required to be paid by Northrop Grumman and the surviving corporation. At the time of
the execution of the merger agreement, Northrop Grumman delivered to Orbital ATK an executed commitment letter pursuant to which Northrop Grumman's financing source
agreed to provide debt financing for the merger. On October 13, 2017, Northrop Grumman issued $8.25 billion of unsecured senior notes. Northrop Grumman intends to use the
net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, together with cash on hand, to finance the Orbital ATK acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. As a result of the
issuance of the senior unsecured notes, Northrop Grumman terminated the commitment letter.

        See "The Merger—No Financing Condition; Financing" beginning on page 65.

Regulatory Approvals (see page 65) 

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), which provides that the merger may
not be completed until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is terminated or expires, and the requirements of the European Commission with respect to the
compatibility of the merger with the common market under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings,
Official Journal L 24, 29.01.2004 (the "Council Regulation"). On October 4, 2017, Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman filed the notification and report forms under the HSR
Act with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Premerger Notification Office of the Federal Trade Commission.

        The waiting period in the EU begins with the filing of the requisite notification by Northrop Grumman to the European Commission which will be made after the conclusion
of pre-notification discussions with the European Commission. The parties expect that these pre-notification discussions will continue for some weeks before Northrop Grumman
files the requisite notification with the European Commission. The initial review period (the "Phase I period") expires on the 25th business day following the filing with the
European Commission. The Phase I period may be extended to 35 business days if the European Commission receives a referral request from an EU member state or the parties
offer remedies to resolve any competition issues. If the European Commission decides to open a Phase II investigation or the matter is referred to any EU member state for
national review, the waiting period would be extended.

        At any time before or after the effective time of the merger, the U.S. reviewing antitrust authority or another person could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking a rescission or other unwinding of the merger,
or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. The European Commission could permit completion subject to regulatory conditions or prohibit the
merger. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.

Conditions to the Merger (see page 77) 

        Each party's obligation to complete the merger depends on the following conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived:

• Orbital ATK stockholders shall have approved the merger proposal; 

• the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the issuance, or deemed issuance, by the European Commission of a
decision finding the merger to be compatible with the common market under the Council Regulation; and 

• the absence of any temporary restraining order, injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition
that has the effect of preventing the consummation of the merger.

        Each party's obligation to complete the merger is also subject to the following additional conditions:

• subject to certain materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party; and 

• the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the closing
date of the merger.

        In addition, Northrop Grumman's obligation to complete the merger is also subject to the following conditions:

• no claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation by any governmental entity shall be pending and no temporary restraining order, injunction or other
judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition shall be in effect which, in each case, imposes or seeks to impose any
restrictions on Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries (including, after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries), other than
certain permitted restrictions described in the merger agreement; and 

• the absence of a material adverse effect on Orbital ATK since the date of the merger agreement.

        The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon Northrop Grumman's receipt of financing.

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals (see page 80) 

        The merger agreement provides that Orbital ATK, its subsidiaries and its and their representatives shall not:

• directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any takeover proposal or any inquiries or the making
of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to a takeover proposal; or 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person, or any such person's representative, information
with respect to or in connection with, or otherwise knowingly cooperate with any person with respect to, any takeover

proposal or any inquiries or proposals that would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to a takeover proposal.

        Orbital ATK, its subsidiaries and its and their representatives must also immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing activities, discussions and negotiations
with any person conducted prior to entering into the merger agreement with respect to any takeover proposal or any inquiries or proposals that would reasonably be expected to
result in or lead to a takeover proposal.

        Notwithstanding the above-described restrictions, if prior to the approval of the Orbital ATK stockholders of the merger proposal, Orbital ATK receives a bona fide written
unsolicited takeover proposal that the Orbital ATK Board determines in good faith is, or determines in good faith would reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal
and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders, Orbital ATK may under certain circumstances furnish information to, and
engage in discussions or negotiations with, the third party making such takeover proposal.

        The terms "superior proposal" and "takeover proposal" are defined under "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals" beginning on page 80.

Changes in Board Recommendation; Termination For Superior Proposal (see page 81) 

        Under the merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions, neither the Orbital ATK Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, publicly
or otherwise, in a manner adverse to Northrop Grumman or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability with respect to the merger agreement or merger or
(ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable (or agree to do any of the foregoing) any takeover proposal.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, prior to the approval of the Orbital ATK stockholders of the merger proposal, the Orbital ATK Board may, under certain
circumstances, effect an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, only if
the Orbital ATK Board has determined in good faith, after, among other things, consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Orbital ATK under applicable law. Prior to effecting an
adverse recommendation change or terminating the merger agreement pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, the Orbital ATK Board must
provide written notice to Northrop Grumman at least three business days prior to such action and during such notice period must negotiate in good faith with Northrop Grumman
regarding, and consider in good faith, any revisions to the merger agreement proposed in writing by Northrop Grumman.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 82) 

        The merger agreement may be terminated by the mutual written consent of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman and Sub, and under certain specified circumstances by either
Orbital ATK or Northrop Grumman.

Termination Fees; Effect of Termination (see page 83) 

        In certain circumstances, the Orbital ATK Board has the right to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior proposal,
as further described in "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 82. In that event and in certain other specified circumstances, the
merger agreement provides that we must pay Northrop Grumman a termination fee of $275 million. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses" beginning on
page 83.

Effects on Orbital ATK if the Merger is not Completed (see page 83) 

        In the event that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement does not receive the required approval from our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, you will not receive any payment for your shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Orbital ATK will remain an independent public company and
stockholders will continue to own their shares of common stock. Under certain circumstances, if the merger agreement is terminated, we may be obligated to pay to Northrop
Grumman a termination fee. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 83.

Delisting and Deregistration of Shares of Common Stock (see page 65) 

        Upon completion of the merger, the shares of our common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

Market Price of Common Stock and Dividend Information (see page 97) 

        The closing price of common stock on the NYSE on September 15, 2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger agreement, was $110.04 per share.
The closing price of common stock on the NYSE on October 23, 2017, the last trading day before the date of this proxy statement was $132.95 per share.

        For the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, Orbital ATK paid three quarterly dividends of $0.32 per share, and the most recent of such dividends was declared on
August 10, 2017 and paid on September 21, 2017. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Orbital ATK paid four quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, Orbital ATK is permitted to, and intends to, continue paying a $0.32 per share quarterly cash dividend between the date of the merger agreement
and the effective time of the merger.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (see page 66) 

        At least five purported class actions challenging the merger have been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, captioned Lickteig v.
Orbital ATK, Inc., et al., filed October 11, 2017 (the "Lickteig Action"), Ayzin v. Orbital ATK, Inc. et al., filed October 13, 2017 (the "Ayzin Action"), Sedon v. Orbital ATK, Inc.,
et al., filed October 16, 2017 (the "Sedon Action"), Berg v. Orbital ATK, Inc., et al., filed October 16, 2017 (the "Berg Action") and Simnowitz v. Orbital ATK, Inc. et al., filed
October 18, 2017 (the "Simnowitz Action" and collectively with the Lickteig Action, Ayzin Action, Sedon Action and Berg Action, the "Actions"). The Lickteig Action and Berg
Action name as defendants Orbital ATK, Orbital ATK's directors, Northrop Grumman and Sub. The Ayzin Action, Sedon Action and Simnowitz Action name as defendants
Orbital ATK and Orbital ATK's directors. The Actions allege certain violations of the Exchange Act and seek, among other things, damages, attorneys' fees and injunctive relief
to prevent the merger from closing. Orbital ATK believes that the Actions lack merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

        If the Actions are not resolved on a timely basis, the Actions could delay consummation of the merger and result in additional costs to Orbital ATK, including costs
associated with the indemnification of directors. Additional plaintiffs may file lawsuits against Orbital ATK and/or our directors and officers in connection with the merger.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposed merger. These questions and answers
may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. For important additional information, please refer to the more detailed discussion contained
elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 

A: You are receiving this proxy statement because you were a stockholder of record of Orbital ATK as of the close of business on the record date for the special meeting.

This document serves as the proxy statement through which Orbital ATK will solicit proxies to obtain the necessary stockholder approval for the consummation of the
proposed merger and the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting described below under "—What is the purpose of the special meeting?".

Q: When and where will the special meeting of stockholders be held? 

A: The special meeting will be held at Orbital ATK's executive offices located at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166 on November 29, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. 

Q: What is the purpose of the special meeting? 

A: At the special meeting, stockholders will consider and vote on: 

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation that will or may be paid to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and 

• a proposal to adjourn the meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal. 

Q: What will I receive in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive $134.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common
stock that you own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

The exchange of shares of common stock for cash in the merger will generally be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a
non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the non-U.S. holder's receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of common
stock pursuant to the merger unless the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to tax under non-U.S. federal income tax laws.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 85 for a more detailed
discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

Q: What happens if the market price of shares of Orbital ATK common stock changes before the closing of the merger? 

A: No change will be made to the merger consideration of $134.50 per share of common stock as a result of a change in the market price of our common stock.

Table of Contents

Q: If the merger is completed, what will happen to Orbital ATK stock options and other Orbital ATK equity awards? 

A: For information regarding the treatment of Orbital ATK stock options and other Orbital ATK equity awards, please see "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity
Awards" beginning on page 68. 

Q: What constitutes a "quorum" for purposes of the special meeting? 

A: A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Holders of a majority of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date and
entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting in order for there to be a quorum. Shares of common stock
represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an "abstention" from voting, will be counted as present for purposes of
establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Shares of common stock held in treasury will not be
included in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock represented at the meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. If a quorum is
not present in person or represented by proxy, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of common stock required to
constitute a quorum are present in person or represented by proxy. 

Q: What is the vote required to adopt the merger agreement? 

A: The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the
record date. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

Q: What is the vote required to approve the other proposals? 

A: The compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the
special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. 

Q: When is the proposed merger expected to be completed? 

A: We intend to complete the merger as soon as reasonably practicable and currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2018. However, the merger is subject
to regulatory clearances and other conditions, in addition to the approval of Orbital ATK's stockholders at the special meeting, and it is possible that factors outside the
control of Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman could result in the merger being completed at a later time or not at all. 

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting? 

A: Only holders of record of common stock at the close of business on October 10, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote
at, the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 57,646,130 shares of common stock were
issued and outstanding and held by 4,626 holders of record. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting.

Q: Who may attend the special meeting? 

A: Stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 10, 2017, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the special meeting. "Street name" holders (those
whose shares are held through a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee) should bring a copy of an account statement reflecting their ownership of common stock
as of the record date. If you are a "street name" holder and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must also bring a legal proxy from the record holder (your broker,
bank, trust company or other nominee) of the shares of common stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. 

Q: How does the Orbital ATK Board recommend that I vote? 

A: The Orbital ATK Board unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its
stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and effect the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Orbital ATK Board
accordingly unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. 

Q: Who is soliciting my vote? 

A: The Orbital ATK Board is soliciting your proxy, and Orbital ATK will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. D.F. King & Co., Inc. ("D.F. King") has been retained as our
proxy solicitor to assist with the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: Carefully read and consider the information contained in this proxy statement, including its annexes.

If you are a holder of record, in order for your shares to be represented at the special meeting:

• you can attend the special meeting in person; 

• you can submit a proxy through the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions included on your proxy card; or 

• you can indicate on the enclosed proxy card how you would like to vote and return the proxy card.

If you hold your shares in "street name," in order for your shares to be represented at the special meeting, you must instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other
nominee as to how to vote your shares by following the directions provided to you by your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee.

Q: How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name? 

A: If you are a record holder of common stock, you may vote in person at the special meeting or authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your
shares by returning the proxy card by mail, or by submitting a proxy to vote through the Internet, or by telephone. We recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even
if you are planning to attend the special meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective
alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to submit a proxy to vote your shares through the Internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to mail
back your proxy card. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see "The Special Meeting—Voting of Proxies" beginning on page
21.

Your failure to vote, or failure to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger
proposal.

Q: How do I vote my shares if they are held in the name of my broker ("street name")? 

A: If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee (that is, in "street name"), you must
follow the directions from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee provided to you in order to vote. Please check the voting form used by your broker, bank,
trust company or other nominee. If you do not provide your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee with instructions, your shares of common stock will not be
counted for purposes of determining a quorum at the special meeting and such shares will not be voted on any proposal at the special meeting, which will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

Please note that you may not vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to Orbital ATK or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you
provide a legal proxy, which you must obtain from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee.

Q: What will happen if I fail to submit a proxy or I abstain from voting? 

A: If you fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, it will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal, but,
assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have no effect on the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. If you mark your proxy to abstain or
provide voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. 

Q: How do I vote my shares held in the Orbital ATK, Inc. 401(k) Plan? 

A: If you hold shares of common stock in the Orbital ATK, Inc. 401(k) Plan, you will receive voting instructions in lieu of a proxy card. The trustee of the Plan will vote
such shares. See "The Special Meeting—Participants in Benefit Plans" beginning on page 21. 

Q: How can I revoke my proxy? 

A: If you have already submitted your proxy by Internet, telephone or by returning your proxy card, you can change your voting instructions at any time before your proxy is
voted at the special meeting. If you are a holder of record, you can do this by sending a signed notice of revocation, granting a new, valid proxy bearing a later date
(including by telephone or through the Internet), or attending the special meeting and voting in person. If you submit a written notice of revocation, it must be received by
the Corporate Secretary of Orbital ATK no later than the beginning of the special meeting. If you grant a new proxy by telephone or Internet, your revised instructions
must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 28, 2017.

If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to
change your vote or revoke your proxy.

Q: Do I need to do anything with my stock certificates now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will mail to each holder of certificates representing shares of common stock as of the effective time of
the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their shares of common stock for the merger consideration. Upon surrender of the certificates for
cancellation along with the executed letter of

Table of Contents

transmittal and other required documents described in the instructions or otherwise required by the paying agent in accordance with the merger agreement, you will
receive the merger consideration. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q: Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting? 

A: If you are unable to attend the special meeting in person, we encourage you to send in your proxy card or submit a proxy to vote by telephone or over the Internet. The
special meeting will not be broadcasted telephonically or over the Internet. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive any payment for their
shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Orbital ATK will remain an independent public company, and shares of common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the NYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the merger is not completed, a termination fee of $275 million may become payable by Orbital ATK to
Northrop Grumman pursuant to the merger agreement. 

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation proposal? 

A: Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are required to submit a proposal to our stockholders for a non-binding,
advisory vote to approve certain compensation that will or may be paid to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. The compensation proposal gives
our stockholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may be paid to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger. 

Q: What will happen if the compensation proposal is not approved? 

A: Approval of the compensation proposal is not a condition to consummation of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning it will not be binding on Orbital ATK.
Accordingly, because Orbital ATK is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, if the proposed merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject
only to the conditions applicable to such compensation payments, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote. 

Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or, if available, please submit your proxy by
telephone or over the Internet. 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before the special meeting? 

A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected closing date of the merger. If you own shares of common stock as of the close of business on the
record date but transfer your shares prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but the right to receive the merger consideration
will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In addition, if you have exercised appraisal rights, transferring
your shares prior to the effective time of the merger will result in the loss of your right to receive the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair
value of your shares.

Table of Contents

Q: May I exercise dissenters' rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the merger? 

A: Yes. Shares of common stock held by stockholders who have properly exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (and have not withdrawn such exercise
or lost such rights) will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, but will instead be converted into the right to receive payment in cash for the
fair value of their shares of common stock as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of common stock as determined in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL may be more or less than (or the same as) the merger consideration. Stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights must
comply fully with all applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement and attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of
Section 262 of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek the advice of your own legal
counsel. 

Q: How can I obtain additional information about Orbital ATK? 

A: We will provide copies of this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, without charge to any stockholder who
makes a written request to our Corporate Secretary at Orbital ATK, Inc., 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings
also may be accessed at www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.orbitalatk.com. Our website address is provided as an inactive textual
reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or
any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.

cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you should contact:

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        This proxy statement is being provided to the stockholders of Orbital ATK in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Orbital ATK Board for use at the special
meeting to be held at the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides
stockholders of Orbital ATK with information about the special meeting and should be read carefully and in its entirety.

Date, Time and Place 

        The special meeting is scheduled to be held at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166 on November 29, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• the merger proposal; 

• the compensation proposal; and 

• the adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of the Orbital ATK Board 

        After careful consideration, the Orbital ATK Board, on September 16, 2017, unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that it is advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and effect the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.
The Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. The Orbital
ATK Board considered many factors in reaching its conclusion to enter into the merger agreement, including, without limitation, the value that stockholders would realize in the
merger, the current and historical market prices of Orbital ATK shares relative to the $134.50 per share merger consideration, the fact that the merger consideration consists
entirely of cash and the risks associated with the implementation of Orbital ATK's business plan. See and read carefully "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on
page 39.

        The Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" each of the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment
proposal. See "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 39.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

        Only holders of record of common stock at the close of business on October 10, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of business on the record date, 57,646,130 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding and
held by 4,626 holders of record. As of the close of business on the record date, approximately 1.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock were held by our directors and
executive officers and their affiliates. We currently expect that our directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the above-listed proposals, although none of
them has entered into any agreements obligating him or her to do so. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for examination by
any stockholder for any purpose germane to the special meeting at our executive offices at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166 during ordinary business hours for a period of
ten days before the special meeting. The list will

Table of Contents

also be available at the special meeting for examination by any stockholder present at the special meeting.

        Each share of common stock owned is entitled to one vote on each proposal at the special meeting.

        If you own shares of common stock that are registered in the name of someone else, such as a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee, you are not a holder of record
and instead hold your shares in "street name." If you hold your shares in "street name," in order for your shares to be represented at the special meeting, you must instruct your
broker, bank, trust company or other nominee as to how to vote your shares by following the directions provided to you by your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee.

Quorum 

        A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Holders of a majority of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date and
entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting in order for there to be a quorum. Shares of common stock
represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an "abstention" from voting, will be counted as present for purposes of
establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Shares of common stock held in treasury will not be included in
the calculation of the number of shares of common stock represented at the meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. If a quorum is not present in person
or represented by proxy, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of common stock required to constitute a quorum are
present in person or represented by proxy.

Required Vote 

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the record date.
Approval of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at
the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

Failure to Vote, Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        If you are a stockholder and fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, it will have the effect of a vote against the
merger proposal, but, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have no effect on the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. If you are a
stockholder and you mark your proxy to abstain or provide voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the merger proposal, the compensation proposal
and the adjournment proposal.

Voting in Person 

        If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held in
"street name," and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must bring to the special meeting a legal proxy executed in your favor from the record holder of the shares (your
broker, bank, trust company or other nominee) authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

        In addition, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver's license or passport. If you hold your shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof
of ownership, such

as a recent account statement or letter from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee proving ownership on the record date, along with proper identification.
Stockholders will not be allowed to use cameras, recording devices and other similar electronic devices at the meeting.

Voting of Proxies 

        If you are a holder of record of common stock as of the record date for the special meeting there are four ways to have your shares voted:

• You can submit a proxy over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by following the instructions on your proxy card. 

• You can submit a proxy using a touch-tone telephone by calling (800) 690-6903, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and following the instructions on your proxy
card. 

• You may complete, sign and mail your proxy card to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. 

• Finally, you may vote in person by written ballot at the special meeting.

        You will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card if you submit a proxy by Internet or telephone. Proxies submitted by Internet or telephone must be
received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 28, 2017.

        As of the date hereof, management has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for consideration at the special meeting and which would be required to be set
forth in this proxy statement or the related proxy card other than the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders. If any other matter is properly presented
at the special meeting for consideration, it is intended that the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their best
judgment on such matter.

        Your vote is important. Accordingly, please mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or submit a proxy via the Internet or by telephone whether or not you plan to
attend the special meeting in person.

        If a properly executed proxy is returned without an indication as to how the shares of common stock represented are to be voted with regard to a particular proposal, the
common stock represented by the proxy will be voted "FOR" such proposal. All shares represented by properly executed proxies received (including proxies received via the
Internet or by telephone) in time for the special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the manner specified by the stockholder giving those proxies.

Participants in Benefit Plans 

        Participants in the Orbital ATK, Inc. 401(k) Plan who have shares of common stock allocated to their plan accounts will receive voting instruction cards in lieu of a proxy
card. Only the trustee of this plan, in its capacity as directed trustee, can exercise the voting rights with respect to shares of common stock allocated to participants' plan accounts
and held in the plan's trust at the special meeting. However, if you are a plan participant who has shares of common stock allocated to your plan account, you are entitled, on a
confidential basis, to instruct the trustee how to cast the votes attributable to the shares of common stock allocated to your plan account (including instructing the trustee not to
vote), as well as a proportionate number of plan shares for which properly executed instructions are not timely received. If you elect not to vote the shares allocated to your
accounts, your shares will be voted proportionally in accordance with the voting instructions received by the trustees from those plan participants who do vote.

Shares Held in "Street Name" 

        If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee (that is, in "street name"), you must
provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares if you wish them to be counted. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your
broker, bank, trust company or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to Orbital ATK or by voting in
person at the special meeting unless you provide a legal proxy, which you must obtain from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee. Further, brokers who hold shares
of common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to Orbital ATK to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.

        If you are a stockholder holding your shares in "street name" and you do not instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your
broker, bank, trust company or other nominee cannot vote your shares, which will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal. If you do not instruct your broker,
bank, trust company or other nominee on how to vote your shares, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, assuming a quorum is
present at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies 

        You have the power to revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a holder of record, you can revoke your proxy in one of
three ways:

• you can send a signed notice of revocation; 

• you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or through the Internet); or 

• you can attend the special meeting and vote in person, which will cancel any proxy previously given. Your attendance at the special meeting alone will not revoke
any proxy that you have previously given.

        If you submit a written notice of revocation, it must be received by the Corporate Secretary of Orbital ATK at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166 no later than the
beginning of the special meeting. If you do so by telephone or through the Internet, your revised instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 28,
2017.

        If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee, you should contact your broker to change your vote or revoke your proxy.

Tabulation of Votes 

        Orbital ATK has appointed one or more representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to serve as the inspector of election for the special meeting. The inspector of
election will, among other matters, determine the number of shares represented at the special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum, determine the validity of all proxies
and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to the stockholders.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The cost of proxy solicitation for the special meeting will be borne by Orbital ATK. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials also
may be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies also may be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by D.F. King

or by certain of our directors, officers, and employees, without additional compensation. Orbital ATK will also request that brokerage firms, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries
forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares of common stock held of record on the record date and will provide customary reimbursement to such firms for the
cost of forwarding these materials. Orbital ATK has retained D.F. King to assist in its solicitation of proxies and has agreed to pay them a fee of approximately $20,000, plus
reasonable expenses, for these services.

Adjournment 

        If a quorum is not present in person or represented by proxy, the chairman of the meeting and the stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the special meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present in
person or represented by proxy. If a quorum is present at the special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal,
then stockholders may be asked to vote on the adjournment proposal. No notices of an adjourned meeting need be given unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days, in
which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date for notice of
such adjourned meeting. At any subsequent reconvening of the special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at
the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that
have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened meeting.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        As discussed below, stockholders are being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement. You should read this proxy statement carefully and in its
entirety for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. In particular, you should read carefully and in its entirety the merger agreement, which is
attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

The Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal.

        If you return a properly executed proxy (including proxies received via the Internet or by telephone), but do not indicate instructions on your proxy, your shares of common
stock represented by such proxy will be voted "FOR" the merger proposal.

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the record date.

        Your failure to vote, or failure to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

THE MERGER 

        The discussion of the merger in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

Effects of the Merger 

        Orbital ATK is seeking the adoption by its stockholders of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Sub will
be merged with and into Orbital ATK, with Orbital ATK surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. The Orbital ATK Board has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Orbital ATK's stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.

        Common Stock.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than treasury shares and any shares owned by Northrop Grumman, Sub
or any person who properly demands appraisal of their shares pursuant to Section 262 of DGCL (and has not withdrawn such demand or lost its appraisal rights)), will be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes.

        Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase common stock that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price applicable to such option, less any applicable tax withholding. If the exercise price applicable to
shares of common stock subject to an option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the option will terminate and be canceled for no consideration.

        Restricted Shares.    Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each restricted share that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Performance Shares.    With respect to our performance shares, if the closing date occurs prior to the date on which performance shares with respect to the 2015-2017
performance period would vest in the ordinary course of business, such performance shares will become vested based on achievement of performance metrics at the greater of
target performance or actual performance and will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above), and (ii) the
merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is
held by an individual who is not a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans or who waives participation in Orbital ATK's income security plans prior to the
effective time of the merger, will become vested based on deemed achievement of target performance, further pro-rated based on the number of days elapsed from the beginning
of the performance period through and including the closing date over the total number of days from the beginning of the scheduled performance period through the end of the
performance period. Such performance shares will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time (after taking into account the vesting at target in connection with the merger described above), and (ii) the
merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. For each performance share that is forfeited due to pro-ration, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective
time of the merger, Northrop Grumman will grant each

holder thereof who remains an employee as of the grant date with a "Northrop Grumman retention grant" of Northrop Grumman restricted stock rights with a value equal to two
times the value of such forfeited performance share (determined based on target performance) that will time vest and not be dependent on the achievement of any performance
metrics. One-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on March 1, 2019, and the remaining one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on
March 1, 2020, in each case subject to continued employment with Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries as of such dates; provided, however, that holders of Northrop
Grumman retention grants who are involuntarily terminated other than for cause prior to March 1, 2019, will vest in one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant upon such
termination and forfeit the remaining one-half.

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is
held by an individual who is a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans and who does not waive participation therein prior to the effective time, will become
vested based on deemed achievement of target performance and will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
common stock subject to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above),
and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Deferred Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each deferred stock unit that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such deferred stock unit immediately prior to the effective time, and
(ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. Such payment will be paid in accordance with and subject to the deferral elections applicable to such deferred
stock units as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Phantom Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each phantom stock unit that is outstanding will become fully vested and will be converted into the right to
receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such phantom stock unit immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) the
merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. Such payment will be paid in accordance with and subject to the deferral elections applicable to such phantom stock
units as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Notwithstanding the above, if any options, restricted shares, performance shares, or deferred stock units are granted following the date of the merger agreement and prior to
the effective time of the merger, the vesting of such awards will instead be pro-rated based on the number of days from the grant date (or for performance shares, from the
beginning of the performance period) through and including the closing date over the number of days from the grant date through the final regularly scheduled vesting date of
such award (or for performance shares, from the beginning to the end of the performance period).

Background of the Merger 

        Orbital ATK's management and the Orbital ATK Board regularly review Orbital ATK's performance, prospects and strategy in light of the current business and economic
environment, as well as developments in the aerospace and defense industries, and opportunities and challenges facing participants in such industries. These reviews have
included, among other things, consideration, from time to time, of potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions, divestitures and business combination
transactions.

        In 2015, Company A approached Orbital ATK about a possible acquisition of Company A by Orbital ATK. Orbital ATK and Company A entered into a mutual non-
disclosure agreement (the "Company A NDA") on November 5, 2015 that included customary confidentiality provisions and a

two-year standstill provision prohibiting the parties from engaging in certain types of actions, including making an acquisition proposal with respect to the other party without the
other party's prior written consent. The standstill provision included a prohibition on both parties from asking for a waiver of the prohibitions, which is commonly referred to as a
"don't ask, don't waive" provision. In December 2015, Orbital ATK ceased discussions with Company A regarding a possible acquisition of Company A. On September 17, 2017,
prior to executing the merger agreement, Orbital ATK sent a letter to Company A releasing it from its standstill obligations under the Company A NDA.

        In 2016, Company B approached Orbital ATK about a possible acquisition of Company B by Orbital ATK. The mutual non-disclosure agreement entered into between
Orbital ATK and Company B did not include a standstill provision. Following several meetings and discussions, the parties ceased discussions in early 2017.

        Northrop Grumman's management and its board of directors (the "Northrop Grumman Board") regularly review Northrop Grumman's performance, prospects and strategy
in light of the current business, global security and economic environment, as well as developments in the aerospace and defense industries, and opportunities and challenges
facing participants in these industries. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions,
divestitures and business combination transactions, as well as other uses of company resources.

        Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman have had a long-standing commercial relationship. Currently, Orbital ATK is a supplier to Northrop Grumman on several significant
programs. In light of the nature of Orbital ATK's and Northrop Grumman's businesses and the commercial relationship between the companies, members of management of both
companies generally are familiar with the other's businesses, and representatives of both companies periodically have consulted on matters relating to their commercial
relationship and the industries in which they operate.

        On January 24, 2017, Mr. Wesley G. Bush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Northrop Grumman, invited Mr. David W. Thompson, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Orbital ATK, to a dinner meeting in Great Falls, Virginia, during which Messrs. Bush and Thompson discussed general aerospace and defense industry
matters as well as activities relating to several significant programs the companies were working on together. Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Thompson raised the subject of a potential
business combination between Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK at that meeting.

        On May 24, 2017, during the Aerospace Industries Association Spring Board of Governors meeting, Mr. Bush initiated a meeting with Mr. Thompson. Mr. Bush was
complimentary of Orbital ATK's work on certain Northrop Grumman programs. He also stated his desire to continue to expand Northrop Grumman's business relations with
Orbital ATK, ranging from broader teaming agreements on specific programs, to potential strategic alliances in selected business areas, or a potential business combination of the
two companies. Mr. Bush did not, however, make any specific proposal regarding a potential business combination, nor were price or any other terms mentioned or discussed.
Mr. Thompson indicated that Orbital ATK had been focused on pursuing its strategy, which was based on organic growth in Orbital ATK's existing product lines as well as in new
products currently in development. He also stated that Orbital ATK itself considered acquisitions of other businesses to strengthen its competitive position and growth
opportunities. Mr. Thompson said that Orbital ATK was not for sale, but stated that he would report Northrop Grumman's potential interest to Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman,
Chairman of the Orbital ATK Board.

        Also on May 24, 2017, Mr. Brett B. Lambert, Vice President of Strategic Planning of Northrop Grumman, met with Mr. Blake E. Larson, Chief Operating Officer of Orbital
ATK. As part of the discussion, Mr. Lambert outlined Northrop Grumman's desire to pursue closer business relations with Orbital ATK, primarily focused on teaming or
partnering on certain programs and certain other

strategic initiatives. In the course of the discussions, Mr. Larson mentioned the earlier meeting between Messrs. Thompson and Bush to Mr. Lambert, but Messrs. Larson and
Lambert focused their meeting on potential programmatic collaboration.

        On June 1, 2017, Mr. Thompson met with Gen. Fogleman to discuss a range of topics, including Northrop Grumman's interest in a closer business relationship with Orbital
ATK, which could potentially include a business combination. Mr. Thompson and Gen. Fogleman agreed that, while Orbital ATK was not contemplating a sale, management
should explore Northrop Grumman's interest in a range of strategic relationships with Orbital ATK and that Mr. Thompson would brief the Orbital ATK Board after more
information on the matter was available.

        On June 9, 2017, Messrs. Lambert and Larson met in-person at Orbital ATK's corporate offices to discuss the potential merits of a closer strategic relationship between the
companies and possible next steps. No price or other terms in respect of a potential business combination were mentioned or discussed between Messrs. Lambert and Larson at
that meeting.

        On June 23, 2017, Messrs. Lambert and Larson held telephone discussions to discuss logistics relating to an upcoming meeting of representatives of the two companies
scheduled for June 28, 2017.

        On June 28, 2017, Messrs. Thompson and Larson and Mr. David M. Wise, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Integration, of Orbital ATK and Mr. Bush, Mr. Kenneth
L. Bedingfield, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Sheila C. Cheston, Corporate Vice President and General Counsel, Mr. Mark A. Caylor, Corporate
Vice President, President of Enterprise Services and Chief Strategy Officer and Mr. Lambert of Northrop Grumman met in-person in Vienna, Virginia to discuss the possibility of
a potential business combination between the two companies. The representatives of Northrop Grumman indicated that Northrop Grumman was interested in a possible
acquisition of Orbital ATK, but that Northrop Grumman would not participate in any auction process. The representatives of Northrop Grumman also emphasized their desire to
move quickly. Orbital ATK's representatives stated that any potential business combination would have to reflect a compelling valuation and structure for Orbital ATK's
stockholders and also would have to maintain Orbital ATK's customer commitments and workforce stability, among other considerations. Orbital ATK's representatives also
emphasized the importance of strict confidentiality during any future discussions. No price or other terms were mentioned or discussed at that meeting.

        Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement, dated June 29, 2017, which did not include a standstill provision. Prior to entering into
the non-disclosure agreement, representatives of Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman disclosed only publicly available information.

        On June 29 and July 7, 2017, Mr. Thompson and Gen. Fogleman held telephone discussions in which Mr. Thompson reported to Gen. Fogleman on the June 28, 2017
meeting with Northrop Grumman, and Mr. Thompson and Gen. Fogleman discussed an additional meeting to be held with Northrop Grumman on July 11, 2017. Mr. Thompson
and Gen. Fogleman again agreed that, while Orbital ATK was not contemplating a sale, management should continue to explore Northrop Grumman's interest in a potential
business combination with Orbital ATK and that a meeting of the Orbital ATK Board could be scheduled during the week of July 17-21, 2017 if Northrop Grumman continued to
express interest in a possible acquisition of Orbital ATK at the July 11, 2017 meeting.

        On July 5-7, 2017, the Northrop Grumman Board held its regularly scheduled annual board meeting focused on Northrop Grumman's strategy and various strategic
alternatives. At that meeting, the Northrop Grumman Board received an update on the discussions with Orbital ATK.

        On July 11, 2017, Messrs. Thompson, Larson and Wise, Mr. Garrett E. Pierce, Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Thomas E. McCabe, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and
Secretary, and Mr. Vivek Upadhyaya, Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis, of Orbital ATK met in-person in

and Northrop Grumman, workforce matters and Orbital ATK's recent financial restatement. The financial plan Orbital ATK provided to Northrop Grumman included Orbital
ATK's financial projections for its business for 2018, 2019 and 2020. See "—Certain Unaudited Financial Information" beginning on page 49.

        On July 12, 2017, Mr. Thompson held a telephone discussion with Dr. James G. Roche, a member of the Orbital ATK Board, to discuss Northrop Grumman's interest in a
potential transaction. Mr. Thompson called Dr. Roche because he was familiar with Northrop Grumman and several of its current executives, having held several executive
positions with Northrop Grumman from 1984 to 2001, including Corporate Vice President and President of its electronic sensors and systems sector, as well as having served as
Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from 2001 to 2005.

        On July 13, 18 and 19, 2017, Orbital ATK provided written responses to Northrop Grumman's diligence requests that were made during and subsequent to the July 11, 2017
meeting. Related conference calls between representatives of Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman were held on July 17 and 18, 2017.

        On July 21, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board held a telephonic meeting. Attending the meeting were all directors, except for Mr. Martin C. Faga and Mr. Robert M. Hanisee,
who were planning to retire at Orbital ATK's annual meeting of stockholders on August 10, 2017, and Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, who was traveling internationally. Mr. Thompson
provided a report on Northrop Grumman's interest in a potential transaction and the interactions between Orbital ATK's representatives and Northrop Grumman's representatives
to date. Mr. McCabe briefed the Orbital ATK Board on its fiduciary duties in the context of a potential transaction. A discussion ensued among the members of the Orbital ATK
Board regarding a potential transaction. The Orbital ATK Board instructed Mr. Thompson to provide an update following the anticipated telephone call from Mr. Bush on
July 26, 2017.

        On July 24, 2017, the Northrop Grumman Board held a telephonic meeting during which Mr. Bush provided an update on discussions with Orbital ATK and possible next
steps.

        On July 26, 2017, Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Thompson and provided Northrop Grumman's indication of interest potentially to acquire all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock for $130.00 per share in cash. Mr. Bush explained that in valuing Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman had not discounted the baseline financial projections
that Orbital ATK's management had provided; rather, Northrop Grumman had accepted the pre-tax projections without adjustment or discount to the baseline financial plan,
which in Northrop Grumman's view, meant that the $130.00 per share offer attributed full-value to the pre-tax projections. Mr. Bush responded to Mr. Thompson's earlier
concerns about customer and program continuity and workforce stability by assuring Mr. Thompson that Northrop Grumman shared those concerns. Mr. Bush said that Northrop
Grumman proposed to retain Orbital ATK's lines of business, to continue Orbital ATK's major growth investments, and, at least initially, to establish Orbital ATK as a fourth
business sector within Northrop Grumman, in part to minimize disruption to ongoing operations, program performance and personnel. Mr. Thompson stated that he would
discuss Northrop Grumman's proposal with the Orbital ATK Board and would contact Mr. Bush on August 1, 2017, for clarification or questions regarding the proposal in
advance of the Orbital ATK Board's in-person meeting on August 10-11, 2017.

        On July 28, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board held a telephonic meeting. Attending the meeting were all directors, except for Mr. Faga and Mr. Hanisee. Mr. Thompson
informed the Orbital ATK Board of Northrop Grumman's proposal. Mr. McCabe briefed the Orbital ATK Board on its fiduciary duties and

other applicable considerations in the context of a sale transaction. A discussion ensued among the members of the Orbital ATK Board regarding the proposal. The Orbital ATK
Board authorized management to contact Citigroup and Hogan Lovells US LLP ("Hogan Lovells") to discuss their potential roles as financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
respectively, in connection with the potential transaction. Orbital ATK subsequently engaged Citigroup as financial advisor and Hogan Lovells as outside legal counsel. Citigroup
and Hogan Lovells had previously represented Orbital Sciences Corporation, including in its merger with Alliant Techsystems, Inc. to form Orbital ATK. Subsequent to that
merger, Citigroup advised Orbital ATK on its consideration of several potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions and divestitures. Similarly, Hogan Lovells
had been previously retained by Orbital ATK in connection with corporate and securities matters, potential acquisitions and divestitures and other legal matters.

        On July 31, 2017, members of Orbital ATK's senior management held a telephone call with representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells to discuss the potential
transaction and negotiating strategy.

        On August 1, 2017, Messrs. Bush and Thompson held a previously scheduled telephone call in which Mr. Thompson advised Mr. Bush that the Orbital ATK Board would be
reviewing Northrop Grumman's proposal at a board meeting on August 10-11, 2017, with the assistance of a financial advisor and legal counsel. On this telephone call, Mr. Bush
informed Mr. Thompson that the Northrop Grumman Board was supportive of the $130.00 per share proposal. Mr. Bush stated that this represented a full price, giving full credit
without any discount to Orbital ATK's pre-tax projections in its baseline financial plan. Messrs. Bush and Thompson agreed to speak on August 11, 2017, after the Orbital ATK
Board meeting.

        On August 10, 2017, Mr. Faga and Mr. Hanisee, who did not stand for re-election, retired from the Orbital ATK Board at Orbital ATK's 2017 annual meeting of
stockholders.

        On August 10-11, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board met in-person to further discuss Northrop Grumman's proposal. All directors, certain members of Orbital ATK's senior
management and representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells attended the meeting. Mr. Thompson began the meeting by providing an overview of Northrop Grumman and a
summary of the discussions to date between Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman that led to Northrop Grumman's proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock at a price of $130.00 per share in cash. The Orbital ATK Board discussed the merits of and risks related to Northrop Grumman's proposal, including that the
proposal was at a significant premium to the historical and recent trading prices of shares of common stock. Representatives from Hogan Lovells briefed the Orbital ATK Board
on its fiduciary duties and other legal matters to be considered in connection with its review of Northrop Grumman's proposal. A discussion ensued among the directors and
representatives of Hogan Lovells regarding fiduciary duties and other legal matters. The Citigroup representatives reviewed Citigroup's relationships with Northrop Grumman,
including its prior mergers and acquisitions advisory work for Northrop Grumman, its role as bookrunner on an investment grade bond offering in 2016 by Northrop Grumman
and its current participation as one of 18 lenders in Northrop Grumman's revolving credit facility. Citigroup committed orally at the meeting (which commitment was
subsequently confirmed in writing) that it would not participate in any potential committed or bridge financing Northrop Grumman may enter into in connection with a
transaction with Orbital ATK, or any related debt offering without the consent of Orbital ATK. Thereafter, the Orbital ATK Board concluded that Citigroup had no material
relationships that in the Orbital ATK Board's view would impair Citigroup's ability to serve as the financial advisor to the Orbital ATK Board.

        Representatives of Citigroup then made a presentation covering, among other topics, current market conditions, the recent trading performance of the shares of common
stock, preliminary financial analyses of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman and its financial condition and potential financing

scenarios and requirements. The Citigroup representatives also discussed with the Orbital ATK Board a range of possible non-price transaction terms. Citigroup also provided the
Orbital ATK Board with an overview of a potential process and a possible timeline for a potential transaction if the Orbital ATK Board determined that pursuing the potential
transaction was in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders. The directors asked numerous questions of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells and discussed negotiating
strategy with Mr. Thompson. The Orbital ATK Board agreed that an all-cash transaction was desirable because of the certainty of value it would provide to Orbital ATK
stockholders, particularly when considering that the expected timing of the closing of any transaction would increase the uncertainty in respect of stock consideration.
Mr. Thompson informed the Orbital ATK Board that Mr. Bush had stated that Northrop Grumman would not participate in an auction of Orbital ATK. The representatives of
Citigroup identified other potential strategic companies that might be able to make and be interested in making an acquisition proposal for Orbital ATK. A discussion ensued
among members of the Orbital ATK Board and representatives of Citigroup regarding the possibility that any other potential strategic buyers would have both the financial ability
and the interest in making and closing on an acquisition proposal at a price greater than Northrop Grumman's $130.00 per share proposal. Representatives of Citigroup and the
Orbital ATK Board also discussed potential financial buyers and, in Citigroup's judgment, the unlikelihood that they would be able to make an acquisition proposal at a greater
price than Northrop Grumman's $130.00 per share offer. After this discussion, the Orbital ATK Board decided that the risk of unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure from any
outreach to other potential strategic buyers and the impact that such disclosure would have on customers and employees of Orbital ATK, and the risk that Northrop Grumman, in
light of Mr. Bush's statements that Northrop Grumman would not participate in an auction of Orbital ATK, would withdraw, outweighed the benefit of contacting other potential
strategic buyers. The Orbital ATK Board considered the benefits and cost to stockholders of monetizing the value of Orbital ATK's business through Northrop Grumman's
proposal, versus the risk and opportunities of continuing on a standalone basis. The directors then discussed the upside potential versus downside risk of Orbital ATK's standalone
business prospects. After further discussion, the Orbital ATK Board directed Mr. Thompson to advise Mr. Bush that the Orbital ATK Board authorized Mr. Thompson to continue
discussions with respect to a potential transaction but that the price of $130.00 per share was inadequate and the Orbital ATK Board was unwilling to proceed with a transaction
based on that valuation.

        Later on August 11, 2017, Mr. Thompson telephoned Mr. Bush to relay that the Orbital ATK Board had met and authorized him to continue discussions with Northrop
Grumman but that the Orbital ATK Board was not willing to proceed with a transaction at a price of $130.00 per share. Among other things, Mr. Thompson advised Mr. Bush
that the $130.00 per share offer price was not a sufficient premium for Orbital ATK which, in Orbital ATK's view, occupies a unique position in the aerospace and defense
industry. Mr. Thompson also pointed out that any revised offer would need to reflect a substantial increase in price and should take into account Orbital ATK's strong financial
projections and the possibility that any transaction may not close until 2018 if there were regulatory scrutiny on the combination of the two companies.

        On August 16, 2017, the Northrop Grumman Board held a telephonic meeting. Mr. Bush and Northrop Grumman's management updated the Northrop Grumman Board on
the status of discussions with Orbital ATK, issues of valuation and the potential transaction, and negotiations. The Northrop Grumman Board expressed support for the positions
Mr. Bush discussed.

        On August 17, 2017, Mr. Bush and Mr. Thompson had a telephone conversation during which Mr. Bush informed Mr. Thompson that Northrop Grumman had performed
further analysis and that Northrop Grumman was prepared to increase its proposal to $134.00 per share in cash. He explained that Northrop Grumman had taken into
consideration the points Mr. Thompson outlined on the August 11, 2017 telephone call. Mr. Bush stated that the $134.00 per share offer price was conditioned on the completion
of customary confirmatory due diligence by Northrop Grumman and agreement on

satisfactory terms. Mr. Bush also stated that this revised offer of $134.00 per share in cash was determined after discussions with, and with the support of, the Northrop Grumman
Board. Mr. Bush emphasized that if the Orbital ATK Board concluded that the $134.00 per share offer price was insufficient, he expected Northrop Grumman would move on to
focus on other strategic priorities. Mr. Thompson informed Mr. Bush that he would relay the revised proposal to the Orbital ATK Board. Mr. Thompson summarized this
discussion in a call with Gen. Fogleman later that day in preparation for Orbital ATK's Board meeting the following day.

        On August 18, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board held a telephonic meeting. Attending the meeting were all directors, certain members of Orbital ATK's senior management and
representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells. Mr. Thompson reported on his discussions with Mr. Bush since the last Orbital ATK Board meeting, including the price increase
to $134.00 per share of common stock in cash and that he viewed it as Northrop Grumman's best and final offer. The Orbital ATK Board discussed this revised offer and the
likelihood that this was in fact Northrop Grumman's best and final price. The Orbital ATK Board discussed the fact that Northrop Grumman's first offer was a significant
premium over recent trading prices of shares of common stock, including the 52-week high, and Northrop Grumman's characterization of its initial offer as representing full
value. The Orbital ATK Board also discussed the negotiations with Northrop Grumman that had occurred to date and the Orbital ATK Board's view, based on prior business
dealings with Northrop Grumman, as to the likelihood of further price increases or extended price negotiations. Representatives of Hogan Lovells reviewed the directors'
fiduciary duties and other legal matters in connection with the Orbital ATK Board's evaluation of the revised offer and the potential transaction. Representatives from Citigroup
provided an update with respect to certain financial analyses based on more recent market information about Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman and the increased proposal of
$134.00 per share in cash. Representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells also reviewed precedent aerospace and defense and other large diversified industrial transactions,
including merger agreement provisions and timelines for such transactions, as part of discussions focused on considerations relating to conditionality and closing certainty in the
context of a potential transaction with Northrop Grumman. The directors engaged in a discussion regarding Northrop Grumman's revised proposal and Orbital ATK's potential
response. The Orbital ATK Board asked that Orbital ATK's management and its advisors consider what important non-price terms of a merger agreement Orbital ATK should
seek. The Orbital ATK Board concluded that it should consider the revised proposal further and discuss again at a meeting early the following week.

        Later on August 18, 2017, Mr. Thompson held a telephone conversation with Mr. Bush during which Mr. Thompson conveyed to Mr. Bush that the Orbital ATK Board
appreciated Northrop Grumman's additional work on valuation and the increased offer, but that the Orbital ATK Board needed additional time to consider the revised offer.

        On August 18, 19 and 20, 2017, Mr. Thompson had telephone conversations with several directors, including Gen. Fogleman, regarding Northrop Grumman's revised offer.

        On August 22, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board held a telephonic meeting. Attending the meeting were all directors, certain members of Orbital ATK's management and
representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells. The representatives of Citigroup made a presentation covering, among other topics, an update on the recent trading performance
of the shares of common stock, an updated preliminary financial analysis of Orbital ATK, taking into account the increased proposal of $134.00 per share of common stock in
cash, Northrop Grumman's financial condition and potential financing scenarios and requirements and certain non-price transaction terms. A discussion among the Orbital ATK
Board members ensued. The Orbital ATK Board determined that the risk of unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure about a potential transaction between Orbital ATK and
Northrop Grumman and the possibility of Northrop Grumman withdrawing its proposal if Citigroup were requested to reach out to other potential interested strategic buyers
outweighed the benefit of contacting other potential strategic buyers. The Orbital ATK Board discussed a range of termination or "break-up" fees and concluded

that a break-up fee ranging from $250 million to $300 million would be acceptable, consistent with termination fees in similar transactions and not likely to preclude a superior
proposal for the acquisition of Orbital ATK. The Orbital ATK Board discussed potential counterproposals which would not involve rejecting Northrop Grumman's increased
$134.00 per share offer, but could possibly either secure certain important non-price transaction terms for Orbital ATK or result in a further increase in price. The Orbital ATK
Board then discussed negotiating strategy and potential counterproposals with Mr. Thompson and authorized Mr. Thompson to continue negotiations with Northrop Grumman.

        On August 23, 2017, Mr. Thompson called Mr. Bush to provide a counterproposal involving two alternatives: (i) Orbital ATK would accept the increased price of $134.00
per share of common stock in cash if Northrop Grumman agreed to several key conditions, along the following lines: (x) Northrop Grumman would agree to have committed
financing at signing with no financing condition to closing, (y) Northrop Grumman would agree to take any and all actions necessary to secure antitrust approval and (z) a two-
tiered break-up fee of $125 million (representing approximately 1.6% of the aggregate transaction consideration represented by the revised offer) for the first 45 days after the
execution of a definitive merger agreement, and $250 million (representing approximately 3.2% of the aggregate transaction consideration represented by the revised offer)
thereafter, or (ii) if Northrop Grumman would not agree to the conditions in (i) above, Orbital ATK would be prepared to accept an increased price, more in the range of $135.00
to $136.00 per share, with a single break-up fee of $250 million. During the August 23, 2017, phone call, Mr. Thompson also told Mr. Bush that Northrop Grumman would need
to complete its due diligence faster than Northrop Grumman's originally proposed timeline of four to six weeks and that Orbital ATK was prepared to open a virtual dataroom on
August 25, 2017 to facilitate Northrop Grumman's due diligence.

        On August 24, 2017, Mr. Bush held a telephone conversation with Mr. Thompson during which Mr. Bush informed Mr. Thompson that he had given consideration to Orbital
ATK's counterproposal, in consultation with Northrop Grumman's legal and financial advisors. After further consideration, and with the support of the Northrop Grumman Board,
Mr. Bush said Northrop Grumman was prepared to increase its offer to $134.50 per share of common stock in cash, but Northrop Grumman was not prepared to accept all of
Orbital ATK's proposed non-price terms. Specifically, Northrop Grumman would not accept a two-tiered termination fee structure, but instead would require a $275 million
termination fee. With respect to the antitrust provisions, Mr. Bush said that Northrop Grumman would not agree to take any and all actions to obtain antitrust clearance, but
Northrop Grumman would be willing to take reasonable actions to obtain antitrust approval. Finally, Mr. Bush told Mr. Thompson that Northrop Grumman would agree to
Orbital ATK's request that there be no financing condition to closing and that Northrop Grumman would have committed financing in place at signing. Mr. Thompson said that he
would relay the revised proposal to the Orbital ATK Board. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Bush then discussed a possible due diligence schedule, the importance of maintaining the
confidentiality of the negotiations and the need to move quickly to negotiate a merger agreement and complete due diligence in the event the companies' respective boards of
directors could agree on price and other key terms.

        On August 25, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board held a telephonic meeting. Attending the meeting were all directors, except for Dr. Lennard A. Fisk and Dr. Schmitt, certain
members of Orbital ATK's management and representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells. At this meeting, Mr. Thompson briefed the Orbital ATK Board on Northrop
Grumman's revised proposal of $134.50 per share of common stock in cash. Mr. Thompson also described Northrop Grumman's revised proposal regarding the non-price terms,
including a $275 million termination fee and that Northrop Grumman would agree to have committed financing at signing but would not agree to an unconditional obligation to
obtain antitrust approval and instead would agree to a merger agreement provision requiring Northrop Grumman to take reasonable actions necessary to obtain antitrust approval.
The Orbital ATK Board then discussed Northrop Grumman's revised proposal. The Orbital ATK Board also discussed Orbital

ATK's ability to consider alternative proposals after the execution of a merger agreement with Northrop Grumman. The Orbital ATK Board determined that a termination fee of
$275 million would not be preclusive to the submission by third parties of acquisition proposals or Orbital ATK's ability to consider and accept a superior proposal, in each case
following the execution of a merger agreement with Northrop Grumman. The Orbital ATK Board agreed that it would be willing to accept the $134.50 per share price, subject to
the Orbital ATK Board's final approval of the non-price terms of a merger agreement, and authorized management and Orbital ATK's advisors to negotiate the terms of a merger
agreement with Northrop Grumman. Mr. Thompson separately called Drs. Fisk and Schmitt after the meeting to brief them on Northrop Grumman's revised proposal and the
Orbital ATK Board's direction to management to proceed with negotiations with Northrop Grumman.

        After the August 25, 2017 Orbital ATK Board meeting, Mr. Thompson called Mr. Bush to convey that the Orbital ATK Board would be willing to accept the price of
$134.50 per share of common stock in cash, subject to the Orbital ATK Board's final approval of the non-price terms of a merger agreement, and reiterated the importance of the
"no shop" and "fiduciary out" provisions and the provisions related to closing conditions and efforts to secure antitrust approvals. On August 25, 2017, Orbital ATK opened the
virtual dataroom and provided access to Northrop Grumman and its advisors.

        From August 24 through September 15, 2017, representatives from Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman held numerous telephone conferences and in-person meetings to
discuss due diligence matters regarding finance, accounting, legal, contracts, regulatory and compliance, operations and human resources.

        On August 29, 2017, Mr. Bush and members of Northrop Grumman's management provided the Northrop Grumman Board with a further update and discussion.

        On August 30, 2017, Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman entered into a revised mutual non-disclosure agreement, which superseded the non-disclosure agreement dated
June 29, 2017. In the August 30, 2017 non-disclosure agreement, Northrop Grumman agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, it had not, and would not, acquire any shares of
common stock other than pursuant to a definitive merger agreement between the two companies. The non-disclosure agreement dated August 30, 2017 further detailed and
addressed the sharing of particular types of potentially sensitive information with the intent to limit access to only certain individuals.

        On September 2, 2017, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP ("Cravath"), outside legal counsel to Northrop Grumman, delivered a draft merger agreement to Hogan Lovells.

        On September 5, 2017, Mr. McCabe and Mr. James S. Black II, Vice President and Assistant General Counsel of Orbital ATK, met in-person with representatives from the
legal department of Northrop Grumman, including Ms. Cheston and Mr. John F. Cox, Vice President and Assistant General Counsel (M&A), Kathryn G. Simpson, Vice President
and Deputy General Counsel, Jennifer C. McGarey, Corporate Vice President and Secretary, and Melissa A. Cox, Corporate Counsel of Northrop Grumman, to discuss legal and
compliance matters related to Orbital ATK. Ms. Cheston and Mr. McCabe also discussed certain provisions of the draft merger agreement.

        On September 6, 2017, Mr. Thompson called Mr. Bush to review the status of due diligence and to discuss certain provisions in the draft merger agreement received from
Cravath on September 2, 2017. They agreed to meet in-person on September 11, 2017, to discuss the potential transaction further and, as necessary, to address certain significant
unresolved matters.

        On September 6, 7 and 8, 2017, Hogan Lovells and Cravath exchanged revised drafts of the merger agreement.

        On September 7, 2017, Messrs. Larson, McCabe and Black from Orbital ATK, representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells, Ms. Cheston and Messrs. Caylor and Cox
and representatives of Cravath met in-person at the McLean, Virginia offices of Hogan Lovells to discuss, review and negotiate terms of the draft merger agreement.

from Northrop Grumman and representatives of Cravath reconvened in-person at the McLean, Virginia, offices of Hogan Lovells to continue to discuss, review and negotiate the
draft merger agreement.

        On September 10, 2017, Orbital ATK's senior management met telephonically with representatives of Citigroup and Hogan Lovells to discuss the terms of the draft merger
agreement. Also, Orbital ATK executed an agreement with Citigroup, dated September 10, 2017, with respect to Citigroup's engagement as Orbital ATK's financial advisor in
connection with a potential transaction. Later on September 10, 2017, Messrs. Larson and McCabe of Orbital ATK discussed certain terms of the draft merger agreement with
Ms. Cheston and Mr. Caylor of Northrop Grumman by telephone.

        On September 11, 2017, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Bush met at the McLean, Virginia, offices of Hogan Lovells to discuss Northrop Grumman's status in securing financing
commitments for the transaction as well as certain organizational topics, customer contact plans, internal communication plans and other outstanding activities leading to the
companies' respective board meetings later that week.

        From September 11 through September 14, 2017, Cravath and Hogan Lovells exchanged revised drafts of the merger agreement. On September 15 and 16, 2017, Cravath
and Hogan Lovells exchanged further revised drafts, particularly of schedules associated with the merger agreement, which provided data and final numbers in place of blanks.

to the "no shop" and "fiduciary out" provisions, closing conditions and efforts to secure antitrust approvals, and the negotiations over those terms.

        On September 14 and 15, 2017, representatives of Orbital ATK met with representatives of Northrop Grumman at the McLean, Virginia offices of Hogan Lovells to discuss
communication plans related to the possible announcement.

        On September 15, 2017, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Bush also spoke by telephone to address several open issues associated with the merger agreement.

        Later on September 15, 2017, Messrs. Larson and McCabe of Orbital ATK held a telephonic meeting with Ms. Cheston, Ms. Peppard and Mr. Cox of Northrop Grumman,
with representatives of Hogan Lovells and representatives of Cravath present, to discuss and resolve the remaining open issues in the draft disclosure schedules.

        On September 16, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board met in-person. All directors, certain members of Orbital ATK's senior management, and representatives of Citigroup and
Hogan Lovells attended the meeting. Representatives of Citigroup reviewed Citigroup's financial analyses of the merger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated September 16, 2017, to the Orbital ATK Board to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken in such opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of
common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Representatives of Hogan
Lovells reviewed the terms of the proposed merger agreement, with a particular focus on the terms relating to Orbital ATK's representations and warranties, interim operating
covenants, the "no-shop" and "fiduciary out" provisions, efforts to secure antitrust approvals, financing, closing conditions, termination fees and termination rights, and the
negotiations over those terms. The Orbital ATK Board discussed the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including that Orbital ATK could entertain certain unsolicited
third-party proposals following the execution and announcement of the merger agreement and the termination fee that would be payable in the event the Orbital ATK Board were
to pursue, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, an alternative proposal that was viewed by the Orbital ATK Board as superior to the merger with Northrop
Grumman. After consultation with Orbital ATK's advisors, the Orbital ATK Board concluded that a termination fee of $275 million was acceptable, consistent with termination
fees in similar transactions and not likely to preclude a superior proposal. The Orbital ATK Board also discussed the Company A NDA and authorized Orbital ATK's senior
management to send a letter to Company A releasing it from its standstill obligations under the Company A NDA.

        Following consideration of the matters discussed during the course of the Orbital ATK Board meeting, Orbital ATK's directors unanimously (i) determined that it was
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and effect the merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, (ii) authorized, approved and adopted the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
(including the merger) on behalf of Orbital ATK, (iii) authorized and approved the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal to be submitted for
approval by stockholders of Orbital ATK at a special meeting of the stockholders and (iv) recommended to Orbital ATK's stockholders that they approve the three proposals.

        On September 17, 2017, Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman executed the merger agreement. On the morning of September 18, 2017, prior to the commencement of
trading on the NYSE, Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman issued a joint press release announcing the transaction and their execution of the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Orbital ATK Board 

        At its meeting on September 16, 2017, the Orbital ATK Board met to consider the merger agreement and after due consideration, unanimously approved the merger
agreement, determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders for Orbital ATK to enter into the merger agreement and effect the
merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders. The
Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

Reasons for the Merger 

        As described above in the section entitled "—Background of the Merger," in evaluating the merger and the merger agreement, the Orbital ATK Board consulted and
discussed with senior management topics and issues related to the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and consulted with and received
the advice of Orbital ATK's legal and financial advisors.

        After careful consideration, the Orbital ATK Board, at a special meeting held on September 16, 2017, unanimously:

• determined that the merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Orbital ATK and its stockholders; 

• authorized, approved and adopted the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the
merger) on behalf of Orbital ATK; 

• authorized and approved the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal to be submitted for approval by stockholders of Orbital
ATK at a special meeting of the stockholders; and 

• recommended to Orbital ATK's stockholders that they approve the three proposals.

        In unanimously determining to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and recommend that Orbital ATK's stockholders vote their shares of common stock in
favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the Orbital ATK Board also considered the material factors that are discussed below. The discussion in this section is not
intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Orbital ATK Board, but rather includes all material factors considered by the Orbital ATK
Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Orbital ATK Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Orbital
ATK Board did not consider it practicable, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision
and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate
determination of the Orbital ATK Board. In addition, individual members of the Orbital ATK Board may have given different weight to different factors. The Orbital ATK Board
made its recommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Orbital ATK Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, management and the
financial and legal advisors.

        The Orbital ATK Board considered, among other things, the following factors as supporting its decision to recommend that Orbital ATK's stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement:

• the $134.50 per share price to be paid in cash in respect of each share of common stock, which represented: 

• a premium of 22.2% over the closing price of shares of common stock on September 15, 2017 (the last trading day prior to the Orbital ATK Board's
approval of the merger agreement); 

• a premium of 24.8% to the average closing price of shares of common stock for the 30 trading days prior to and including September 15, 2017; 

• a premium of 28.7% to the average closing price of shares of common stock for the 60 trading days prior to and including September 15, 2017; 

• a premium of 30.7% to the average closing price of shares of common stock for the 90 trading days prior to and including September 15, 2017; 

• a premium of 20.1% to the 52-week all-time high (intraday) price of shares of common stock as of September 15, 2017; and 

• a multiple of 14.4 times Orbital ATK's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the 12-month period ended July 2,
2017; 

• the Orbital ATK Board's belief, based on discussions and negotiations between Orbital ATK's Chief Executive Officer and other members of Orbital ATK's
management and Northrop Grumman, that $134.50 per share was the highest price Northrop Grumman would be willing to pay; 

• the opinion of Citigroup, dated September 16, 2017, to the Orbital ATK Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion,
of the $134.50 in cash per share merger consideration to be received by holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) pursuant to the merger
agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and qualifications on
the review undertaken as more fully described under "—Opinion of Financial Advisor" beginning on page 43; 

• the Orbital ATK Board's assessment of Orbital ATK's present and future value on a standalone basis relative to the $134.50 per share in cash to be paid in the
merger; 

• the Orbital ATK Board's belief, based on a review of the possible alternatives to a sale of Orbital ATK, including the prospects of continuing to operate in
accordance with the existing business plan or undertaking additional share buyback programs or other strategic initiatives, the potential value to stockholders of
such alternatives and the timing and likelihood of actually achieving additional value for stockholders from these alternatives, that none of these options, on a risk-
and time-adjusted basis, was reasonably likely to create value for stockholders greater than the merger consideration; 

• the continued costs, risks and uncertainties associated with continuing to operate independently as a public company, including risks associated with Orbital
ATK's operations and business plan; 

• whether there were other potential parties that might have an interest in, and be financially capable of, engaging in a strategic transaction with Orbital ATK at a
value higher than Northrop Grumman's proposal; the potential regulatory, commercial and financing issues that might arise in connection with pursuing such a
transaction; and the belief that Northrop Grumman would withdraw from consideration of a potential transaction if Orbital ATK were to pursue other potential
parties;

• the fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash (which provides certainty of value and liquidity to stockholders and does not expose them to any
future risks related to the business or the financial markets generally, as compared to a transaction in which stockholders receive equity or other securities, or as
compared to remaining independent); 

• the fact that the price Northrop Grumman will pay to stockholders was the result of extensive negotiations, as described in the section above entitled "—
Background of the Merger"; 

• the fact that the merger is not subject to approval by Northrop Grumman's stockholders; 

• the fact that Northrop Grumman had obtained debt financing, the limited number and nature of the conditions to the debt financing and the reputation of the
financing source, each of which, in the reasonable judgment of the Orbital ATK Board, increased the likelihood of such financing being consummated; 

• the provisions of the merger agreement, including: 

• subject to Orbital ATK's compliance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the Orbital ATK Board's ability to furnish information to, and
engage in negotiations with, third parties that have made a bona fide written unsolicited takeover proposal that is a superior proposal or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a superior proposal, as more fully described in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals" beginning on
page 80; 

• the $275 million termination fee, which the Orbital ATK Board believed, after consultation with Orbital ATK's legal and financial advisors, was acceptable
and not likely to preclude a superior proposal; 

• Orbital ATK's ability, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, to execute a definitive agreement with respect to a
superior proposal, as long as Orbital ATK pays Northrop Grumman the $275 million termination fee; 

• the right of the Orbital ATK Board, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and under certain circumstances, to
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to do any of the foregoing, the Orbital ATK Board's recommendation or declaration of
advisability with respect to the merger agreement or the merger; 

• sufficient operating flexibility for Orbital ATK to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice between the execution of the
merger agreement and the effective time of the merger; and 

• the fact that the conditions to the closing of the merger are specific and limited in scope; 

• the Orbital ATK Board's belief that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as a whole, provide protection against the risk that the consummation of the merger
is delayed or that the merger cannot be completed due to a failure to receive required regulatory approvals, based on, among other things: 

• the covenants contained in the merger agreement obligating each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the merger to be consummated and to
resolve objections under applicable antitrust laws; and 

• the provision of the merger agreement that allows the outside date for completing the merger to be extended to December 17, 2018, if the merger has not
been completed by the initial September 17, 2018 outside date because the required regulatory approvals have not been obtained; 

• the fact that the merger agreement permits Orbital ATK to continue to pay to its stockholders quarterly cash dividends not to exceed $0.32 per share of common
stock, which potentially

provides additional amounts to Orbital ATK stockholders prior to the effective time of the merger;

• the Orbital ATK Board's belief that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as a whole, including, among other things, the parties' representations, warranties and
covenants, and the conditions to the parties' respective obligations, are reasonable; 

• the fact that a vote of Orbital ATK stockholders is required under the DGCL to adopt the merger agreement; and 

• the Orbital ATK Board's belief, based on the Orbital ATK Board's general knowledge of Northrop Grumman's business, operations, management, reputation and
financial condition, that there was a high probability that the merger would be completed on the agreed-upon terms.

        In the course of its deliberations, the Orbital ATK Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the merger agreement and the merger,
including, among other things, the following factors:

• the possibility that the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure of the conditions specified in the merger agreement,
including, among other things, with respect to the required approvals of the merger by antitrust regulatory authorities; 

• the fact that the merger may not be completed unless and until the conditions specified in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived (see "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Merger" beginning on page 77); 

• the potential risks and costs to Orbital ATK if the merger is not consummated, or is not consummated in a timely manner, including, among other things, the
potential distraction of management and employee attention during the pendency of the merger, employee attrition, the possible impact on customer relationships,
the potential effect on existing relationships with other parties, and the impact that the failure of the merger to close could have on the trading price of shares of
common stock, Orbital ATK's operating results (including the costs incurred in connection with the merger) and Orbital ATK's ability to maintain sales; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of Orbital ATK's business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay or prevent Orbital ATK from undertaking
certain business opportunities, such as material acquisitions or divestitures; 

• the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and delays in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary for the completion of the merger; 

• the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict Orbital ATK's ability to solicit a takeover proposal to acquire Orbital ATK or to engage in discussions or
negotiations with third parties regarding a takeover proposal to acquire Orbital ATK, in the latter case unless, and subject to compliance with the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited takeover proposal which did not result from a material breach of the no
solicitation provision of the merger agreement, the Orbital ATK Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or
another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such unsolicited takeover proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
superior proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Orbital ATK under applicable law; 

• the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and completing the merger, including in connection with any litigation that
may result from the announcement or pendency of the merger, and the fact that if the merger is not consummated Orbital ATK may be required to bear such costs;

• the fact that receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger would generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (see "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 85); and 

• the fact that the all-cash consideration, while providing relative certainty of value, would prevent Orbital ATK stockholders from having an ongoing equity
interest in Northrop Grumman, meaning that stockholders will not participate in Northrop Grumman's potential revenue or earnings growth, including any growth
or share gains with current customers, and any increase in demand from customers in the industries in which Orbital ATK operates.

        In addition to considering the factors described above, the Orbital ATK Board also considered (i) the prior relationships between Citigroup and Northrop Grumman that
Citigroup disclosed to the Orbital ATK Board, as described below in the section entitled "—Opinion of Financial Advisor," and (ii) the fact that Orbital ATK's directors and
executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Orbital ATK stockholders generally, including those interests that
are a result of employment and compensation arrangements with Orbital ATK, as described in the section below entitled "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger."

        This explanation of the Orbital ATK Board's reasons for recommending the adoption of the merger agreement and other information presented in this section is forward-
looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements"
beginning on page 17.

        The Orbital ATK Board accordingly unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment
proposal.

Opinion of Financial Advisor 

        Orbital ATK retained Citigroup as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with this engagement, Orbital ATK requested that Citigroup evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $134.50 per share cash consideration to be received in the merger by holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded
shares). On September 16, 2017, at a meeting of the Orbital ATK Board held to evaluate the merger and at which the merger agreement was approved, Citigroup rendered to the
Orbital ATK Board an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 16, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citigroup as set forth in its written opinion, the
merger consideration to be received by the holders of common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

        The full text of Citigroup's written opinion, dated September 16, 2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and
qualifications on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of Citigroup's opinion set forth
below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Citigroup's opinion. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. Citigroup's opinion was provided for
the information of the Orbital ATK Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did
not address any other aspects or implications of the merger. Citigroup was not requested to consider, and its opinion did not address, the underlying business decision
of Orbital ATK to effect the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for Orbital ATK or the effect
of any other transaction in which Orbital ATK might engage. Citigroup's opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as
to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed merger or otherwise.

        In arriving at its opinion, Citigroup, among other things:

• reviewed a draft, dated September 16, 2017, of the merger agreement; 

• held discussions with certain senior officers, directors, and other representatives and advisors of Orbital ATK concerning the business, operations and prospects of
Orbital ATK; 

• examined certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Orbital ATK as well as certain financial forecasts and other information and data
relating to Orbital ATK which were provided to or discussed with Citigroup by Orbital ATK's management; 

• reviewed the financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement in relation to, among other things, current and historical market prices and trading
volumes of Orbital ATK's common stock, the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Orbital ATK and the capitalization and financial
condition of Orbital ATK; 

• considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which Citigroup considered relevant in evaluating the merger; 

• analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of other companies whose operations Citigroup
considered relevant in evaluating those of Orbital ATK; and 

• conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as Citigroup deemed
appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

        In rendering its opinion, Citigroup assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data
publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citigroup and upon the assurances of Orbital ATK's management that it was not aware of any
relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citigroup. With respect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Orbital ATK
provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citigroup, Citigroup was advised by Orbital ATK's management that such forecasts and other information and data were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Orbital ATK's management as to the future financial performance of Orbital ATK.

        Citigroup assumed, with Orbital ATK's consent, that the merger would be completed in accordance with its terms as set forth in the merger agreement, without waiver,
modification, or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and
releases for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Orbital ATK or the merger. Citigroup was advised by
representatives of Orbital ATK, and assumed, that the financial terms of the merger agreement would not vary from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citigroup. Citigroup
did not make, nor was it provided with, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Orbital ATK, nor did Citigroup make any
physical inspection of the properties or assets of Orbital ATK. Citigroup was not requested to, nor did Citigroup, solicit third party indications of interest in the possible
acquisition of all or a part of Orbital ATK, nor was Citigroup requested to consider, and its opinion does not address, the underlying business decision of Orbital ATK to effect the
merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for Orbital ATK or the effect of any other transaction in which Orbital
ATK might engage. Citigroup expressed no view as to, and its opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Citigroup's
opinion was necessarily based upon information available to Citigroup, and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing, as

of the date of its opinion. The issuance of Citigroup's opinion was authorized by Citigroup's fairness opinion committee.

        In preparing its opinion, Citigroup performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. This summary of these analyses is not a
complete description of Citigroup's opinion or the analyses underlying, and factors considered in connection with, Citigroup's opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Citigroup arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses
undertaken by it and assessed as a whole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion.
Accordingly, Citigroup believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of such analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying
such analyses and Citigroup's opinion.

        In its analyses, Citigroup considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions, and other matters existing as of the date of its
opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Orbital ATK. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical to Orbital ATK or the merger. An evaluation of these
analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions reviewed.

        The estimates contained in the analyses performed by Citigroup and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used
in, and the results derived from, the analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        Citigroup was not requested to, and it did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the merger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was
determined through negotiations between Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Orbital ATK Board.
The opinion of Citigroup was only one of many factors considered by the Orbital ATK Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the
views of the Orbital ATK Board or Orbital ATK's management with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the merger or any other aspect of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented to the Orbital ATK Board in connection with the delivery of Citigroup's opinion. The financial
analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Citigroup's financial analyses, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of such analyses.

Selected Public Companies Analysis

        Citigroup performed a selected public companies analysis, which is an analysis designed to estimate an implied value of a company through an analysis of the public
valuation and trading multiples of similar publicly traded companies. Citigroup reviewed financial and stock market information of Orbital

ATK and the selected publicly traded companies described below (the "selected companies"), which include aerospace and defense companies. No publicly traded company is
identical to Orbital ATK, but these companies were selected because, among other reasons, they possessed certain financial, operational or business characteristics that, in
Citigroup's view, were sufficiently comparable to those of Orbital ATK or otherwise relevant for purposes of comparison:

• Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.; 

• BAE Systems plc; 

• General Dynamics Corporation; 

• Harris Corporation; 

• Lockheed Martin Corporation; 

• L3 Technologies, Inc.; 

• MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates Ltd.; 

• Northrop Grumman Corporation; 

• Raytheon Company; and 

• Thales SA.

        Citigroup reviewed, among other information, (i) firm values of the selected companies, calculated as equity values (based on closing stock prices of the selected companies
on September 14, 2017) plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents and other adjustments, as a multiple of EBITDA and (ii) per share equity values of the selected companies
(based on closing stock prices of the selected companies on September 14, 2017) as a multiple of earnings per share ("EPS") using the estimated EBITDA and EPS for calendar
year 2018. The observed multiples of firm value to estimated 2018 EBITDA for the selected companies ranged from 8.8x to 13.4x (with a median of 12.4x). The observed
multiples of per share equity values to estimated 2018 EPS for the selected companies ranged from 10.9x to 26.9x (with a median of 19.4x). Based on its professional judgment
and taking into consideration the observed multiples for the selected companies, Citigroup then derived a selected range of multiples of 9.0x to 13.0x for firm value to estimated
2018 EBITDA and a selected range of multiples of 17.5x to 21.5x for per share equity value to estimated 2018 EPS, and applied these selected ranges to the 2018 estimated
EBITDA and the 2018 estimated EPS of Orbital ATK, respectively, to calculate implied firm value and equity value per share reference ranges for Orbital ATK, respectively.
Financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates, public filings and other information and took into account the pending
acquisition of Guavus, Inc. and DigitalGlobe, Inc. by Thales SA and MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates Ltd., respectively. Financial data of Orbital ATK were based on Orbital
ATK's filings and financial information provided by Orbital ATK's management. From this analysis, using its professional judgment, Citigroup derived the following implied
average per share equity value reference range (rounded to the nearest $0.05) for Orbital ATK, as compared to the merger consideration to be received in the merger:

Selected Transactions Analysis

        Citigroup performed a selected transactions analysis, which is an analysis designed to estimate an implied value of a company through an analysis of the multiples paid in
acquisitions of similar companies and businesses. Citigroup reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information for selected transactions in the aerospace and defense
industries announced between June 2012 and February 2017 with a range of approximate transaction values of $875 million to $9.0 billion, which are

collectively referred to in this proxy statement as the "selected transactions." The selected transactions are set forth in the table below.

        The transactions were generally selected because they involved companies with certain financial, operational or business characteristics that, in Citigroup's view, made them
sufficiently comparable to Orbital ATK and/or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or otherwise relevant for purposes of comparison. For each of the selected
transactions, Citigroup reviewed the firm value of the selected transaction, calculated as the diluted equity purchase price plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents and other
adjustments, as a multiple, to the extent publicly available, of, among other things, the last twelve months ("LTM") EBITDA of the relevant target company. The observed
multiples of firm value to LTM EBITDA for the selected transactions ranged from 9.2x to 12.6x (with a median of 10.4x and a mean of 10.7x). Based on its professional
judgment and taking into consideration the observed multiples for the selected transactions, Citigroup then applied a selected range of multiples of 9.5x to 11.5x to the estimated
2017 EBITDA of Orbital ATK. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on public filings and other information. Financial data of Orbital ATK were based on
financial information provided by Orbital ATK's management. This analysis implied the following approximate per share equity value reference range for Orbital ATK (rounded
to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the merger consideration to be received in the merger:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Citigroup also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Orbital ATK by calculating the estimated present value of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Orbital
ATK was forecasted to generate during calendar years 2018 through 2020 based on the Orbital ATK projections (the "projected cash flows"). For purposes of this analysis, the
projected cash flows provided by Orbital ATK's management excluded the impact of cash pension reimbursements and contributions and annual cash flows from Orbital ATK's
A350 and CRS-2 receivables, which, collectively, we refer to as the "additional cash flow items," as well as net environmental remediation payments. The additional cash flow
items were excluded from the projected cash flows because Orbital ATK management believes they are significant items that are non-perpetual. The net environmental
remediation payments were excluded because that item is also non-perpetual and is reflected as a liability on Orbital ATK's balance sheet. As described below, Citigroup included
the estimated cash flows from these items in the discounted cash flow analysis by adding the net present value of the additional cash flow items and subtracting the net
environmental remediation liability. The estimated range of terminal values of Orbital ATK was calculated by applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.5% to
2.5% to Orbital ATK's estimated unlevered, after-tax free cash flows for the terminal year (excluding the additional cash flow items and the net environmental remediation
payments), as provided by Orbital ATK's management. The projected cash flows, range of terminal values, and additional cash flow items (based on projections provided by
Orbital ATK's management) were discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2017) using discount rates ranging from 6.9% to 8.2% derived from a weighted average cost
of capital calculation, and the net environmental remediation liability, as disclosed in Orbital

Other Information

        Citigroup observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of Citigroup's financial analysis with respect to its opinion but were noted for informational
purposes for the Orbital ATK Board, including the following:

• Historical Stock Trading Analysis.  Citigroup reviewed the historical trading prices of Orbital ATK's common stock for the 52-week period ended September 14,
2017. This analysis showed an intraday trading range of $71.52 to $112.03 for the 52-week period ended September 14, 2017. Citigroup noted that the merger
consideration was above such range. 

• Analyst Price Targets.  Citigroup reviewed the public market trading price targets for Orbital ATK's common stock published by securities research analysts as of
September 14, 2017. These targets reflected each analyst's estimate of the one-year forward public market trading price for Orbital ATK's common stock. The
public market trading price targets published by the securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares and these
estimates are subject to uncertainties, including future financial performance of Orbital ATK and future financial market conditions. The securities research
analysts' price targets for Orbital ATK's common stock indicated a target stock price range of approximately $108.00 to $122.00 per share, which implied a
reference range of $99.80 to $112.75 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.05) when discounted one-year to present value at the estimated mid-point Orbital ATK
cost of equity of 8.2%. Citigroup noted that the merger consideration was above such ranges. 

• Precedent Premiums Paid Analysis.  Citigroup reviewed publicly available data relating to premiums paid in all-cash public transactions announced between
January 1, 2007, and September 14, 2017, with transaction values of greater than $5 billion (excluding transactions involving financial institutions as targets).
Citigroup applied a selected range of one-day premiums of 25% to 45% (derived from the premiums paid in such transactions over the target companies involved
in such transactions unaffected closing stock price) to the closing price of Orbital ATK's common stock on September 14, 2017, which indicated an approximate
implied per share equity value reference range of Orbital ATK of $135.50 to $157.15 per share. Citigroup also applied a selected range of 52-week high premiums
of 5% to 30% (derived from the premiums paid in such transactions over the target companies involved in such transactions 52-week intraday high unaffected
stock price) to the 52-week high unaffected closing stock price of Orbital ATK's common stock as of September 14, 2017, which indicated an approximate
implied per share equity value reference range of Orbital ATK's common stock of $117.65 to $145.65 per share.

Miscellaneous

        Orbital ATK has agreed to pay Citigroup for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of $40 million, $5 million of which became payable upon delivery
of Citigroup's opinion and $35 million of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Orbital ATK has agreed to reimburse Citigroup for
expenses incurred by Citigroup in performing its services, and to indemnify Citigroup and related parties against certain liabilities, including under federal securities laws, arising
out of Citigroup's engagement.

        Citigroup and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and other similar
financial services to Orbital ATK and its affiliates unrelated to the merger, for which Citigroup and its affiliates received and expect to receive compensation, including, during
the two year period prior to the date of its opinion, having acted (i) as joint book-runner for an offering of senior notes by Orbital ATK in September 2015 and (ii) as lender,
syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book-runner in connection with a term loan and revolving credit facility for Orbital ATK. Citigroup and its affiliates in the past
have also provided, and currently provide, services to Northrop Grumman unrelated to the proposed merger, for which services Citigroup and its affiliates have received and
expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to the date of its opinion, having acted as joint book-runner for an offering of
senior notes by Northrop Grumman in November 2016. In the ordinary course of its business, Citigroup and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of Orbital ATK
and Northrop Grumman for its own account or for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition,
Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman and their respective affiliates. In the two
year period prior to June 30, 2017, Citigroup and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues of approximately $0.6 million from Orbital ATK and certain of its affiliates and
approximately $0.4 million from Northrop Grumman and certain of its affiliates for the services unrelated to the merger.

        Orbital ATK selected Citigroup as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Citigroup's reputation, experience and familiarity with Orbital ATK and its
business. Citigroup is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and
other purposes.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        Although Orbital ATK typically issues (and updates) annual financial guidance to investors, Orbital ATK does not as a matter of course make public long-term projections as
to future performance, earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the
merger, Orbital ATK's management prepared and provided to Northrop Grumman certain unaudited prospective financial information regarding Orbital ATK's operations for
fiscal years 2017 through 2020 (the "Orbital ATK projections"). The Orbital ATK projections were provided to the Orbital ATK Board and Orbital ATK's financial advisor,
Citigroup, including in connection with Citigroup's financial analyses described above under the section entitled "—Opinion of Financial Advisor." The below summary of the
Orbital ATK projections is included for the purpose of providing stockholders certain nonpublic information that was furnished to certain parties in connection with the merger,
and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence the voting decision of any stockholder.

        The Orbital ATK projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections, the use of non-GAAP
financial measures or forward-looking statements, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public

Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. None of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman, Citigroup or their respective officers, directors,
affiliates, advisors or other representatives considered, or now consider, the inclusion of the Orbital ATK projections to be regarded as an indication that the Orbital ATK
projections are predictive of actual future events or results and such information should not be relied upon as such, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on the Orbital ATK projections. The Orbital ATK projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Orbital ATK's
management.

        While presented with numeric specificity, this unaudited prospective financial information was based on numerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related
to industry performance and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Orbital ATK's business) that are inherently subjective
and uncertain and are beyond the control of Orbital ATK's management. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause this unaudited prospective financial
information not to be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Orbital ATK's business (including its ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives
and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 17. This unaudited prospective financial information also reflects numerous variables, expectations and
assumptions available at the time it was prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained
in this unaudited prospective financial information. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Stockholders are urged
to review the most recent SEC filings of Orbital ATK for a description of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources,
including in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Orbital ATK's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. None of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman, Citigroup or their respective
officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from this unaudited prospective financial
information.

        ORBITAL ATK UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE BELOW UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE
FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE THIS UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL
INFORMATION WAS GENERATED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR. SINCE THE UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL
INFORMATION COVERS MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS NATURE BECOMES LESS PREDICTIVE WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE YEAR.

        Orbital ATK has not made and makes no representation to Northrop Grumman or any Orbital ATK stockholder, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the below
unaudited prospective financial information or regarding Orbital ATK's actual performance compared to the unaudited prospective financial information or that the projected
results will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the unaudited prospective financial information, Orbital ATK urges all of our
stockholders not to place undue reliance on such information and to review Orbital ATK's most recent SEC filings for a description of Orbital ATK's reported financial results.

        Neither Orbital ATK's independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective
financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility

        The Orbital ATK projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions, including the following: (i) the repurchase of Orbital ATK common stock in an aggregate
amount of $650 million (or approximately 1.5 million shares per year), (ii) a dividend yield on Orbital ATK common stock of approximately 1.5% with approximately 8% annual
growth, (iii) debt amortization of approximately $125 million over the three year plan, (iv) an effective tax rate of 28%, and (v) continued pension income and funding with a 7%
long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Orbital ATK Board that stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, stockholders should be aware that our directors and
executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally and that may present actual or potential
conflicts of interest. The Orbital ATK Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger

Treatment of Equity Awards

        Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase common stock that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price applicable to such option, less any applicable tax withholding. If the exercise price applicable to
shares of common stock subject to an option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the option shall terminate and be canceled for no consideration.

        None of Orbital ATK's non-employee directors hold any outstanding options. The following table sets forth, based on options outstanding as of September 21, 2017, the cash
proceeds that each of our executive officers would receive at the effective time of the merger in respect of the settlement of their options.

described above), and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. For each performance share that is forfeited due to pro-ration, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the effective time of the merger, Northrop Grumman will grant each executive officer who is an employee of Northrop Grumman as of the grant date with a
"Northrop Grumman retention grant" of Northrop Grumman restricted stock rights with a value equal to two times the value of such forfeited performance share (determined
based on target performance) that will time vest and not be dependent on the achievement of any performance metrics. One-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will
vest on March 1, 2019, and the remaining one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on March 1, 2020, in each case subject to continued employment with
Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries as of such dates; provided, however, that holders of Northrop Grumman retention grants who are involuntarily terminated other than for
cause prior to March 1, 2019 will vest in one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant upon termination and forfeit the remaining one-half.

        2016-2018 and 2017-2019 Performance Periods (if executive officer does not waive rights under income security plans).    Immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is held by an executive officer who does not waive
participation in Orbital ATK's income security plans prior to the effective time will become vested based on deemed achievement of target performance and will be converted
into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such performance share immediately prior to the effective
time (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above), and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        The following table sets forth, based on performance shares outstanding as of September 21, 2017, (i) the cash proceeds that each of the executive officers would receive at
the effective time of the merger, assuming that each of the executive officers waives his or her rights under the income security plans and assuming an effective time of

2017, the cash proceeds that each of our non-employee directors and executive officers would receive in connection with the merger in respect of the settlement of their phantom
stock units.

Change in Control Severance

        Each of Orbital ATK's executive officers participates in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans—either the Alliant Techsystems Inc. Income Security Plan (the "2013
ISP") or the Orbital ATK, Inc. Income Security Plan (the "2015 ISP"), each of which provides for severance payments upon a "qualifying termination" in connection with a
"change in control" of Orbital ATK. Generally, a "qualifying termination" is an involuntary termination of employment without "cause" or a voluntary termination of employment
for "good reason" in connection with a "change in control" (as such terms are defined in the 2013 ISP or the 2015 ISP, as applicable). All of Orbital ATK's executive officers are
participants in the 2013 ISP, with the exception of Mr. Lehr, who participates in the 2015 ISP. Absent a "change in control" of Orbital ATK (such as the merger) on or prior to
February 9, 2018, the 2013 ISP is scheduled to terminate on February 9, 2018, and upon such termination of the 2013 ISP, participants thereunder are then eligible to become
participants in the 2015 ISP as of February 10, 2018. If Orbital ATK experiences a "change in control" (such as the merger) on or prior to February 9, 2018, then the term of the
2013 ISP will extend, and the 2013 ISP will continue to govern the treatment of the executive officers participating thereunder.

Table of Contents

        All cash payments described in the 2013 ISP and 2015 ISP sections below (other than payments under any supplemental retirement benefit under the 2013 ISP) will be paid
in a lump sum not later than the 15th day of the third calendar month following the date of a participant's "qualifying termination." The supplemental retirement benefit is paid on
the later of (i) six months following termination of employment or separation of service (as defined by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code")) or (ii) February 1 of the following calendar year. A participant is entitled to such benefits under the 2013 ISP or 2015 ISP in consideration of his or her execution of a
separation agreement and general release of claims (the "release"). The obligation to provide payments and benefits to a participant will be conditioned on the participant's
continuing compliance with the confidentiality and non-disparagement, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants set forth in the release and the covenants to provide
services to Orbital ATK set forth in the release. While the confidentiality and non-disparagement obligations are in perpetuity, the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants
apply for the twelve-month period or 6-month period following such "qualifying termination" under the 2013 ISP and for the one-year period following such "qualifying
termination" under the 2015 ISP. If a breach of these post-employment restrictions occurs, Orbital ATK is entitled to injunctive relief and any other legal or equitable remedies.

        Plan Provisions under the 2013 ISP.    Under the 2013 ISP, participants are divided into two tiers with different levels of payments and benefits: "Tier 1 Participants," which
include David W. Thompson, Blake E. Larson, Garrett E. Pierce, and Thomas E. McCabe; and "Tier 2 Participants," which include Frank L. Culbertson, Antonio L. Elias,
Michael A. Kahn, and Christine A. Wolf.

        In the event of a "qualifying termination" which is generally an involuntary termination of employment without "cause" or a voluntary termination of employment for "good
reason" (i) within twelve months after a "change event" and no more than twelve months prior to a "change in control" (in limited circumstances) or (ii) within three years
following a "change in control" (each such term as defined in the 2013 ISP), each participant in the 2013 ISP will be eligible to receive:

• a cash payment equal to three times (for Tier 1 Participants) or two times (for Tier 2 Participants) the participant's annual base salary and current annual cash
incentive opportunity for which the participant is eligible, assuming the target level of performance had been achieved with respect to the annual cash incentive; 

• a prorated portion of the annual cash incentive payment for which the participant is eligible for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, calculated based on
(i) the target level of performance if the termination occurs within the first three quarters of the fiscal year or (ii) the greater of projected performance or target
performance if the termination occurs within the fourth quarter of the fiscal year; 

• a cash payment equal to the cash amount the participant would receive under any long-term cash incentive plan assuming target performance had been achieved; 

• immediate full vesting and payment of any outstanding stock awards, including performance vesting stock awards, with payment of any outstanding performance
vesting stock awards at the target level of performance; 

• a cash payment equal to three times (for Tier 1 Participants) or two times (for Tier 2 Participants) the maximum 401(k) plan match the participant would have
received for the calendar year in which the termination occurs; 

• a cash payment equal to the value of benefits that Orbital ATK would have provided to the participant under Orbital ATK's group health plan for a period
following termination of three years (for Tier 1 Participants) and two years (for Tier 2 Participants);

Table of Contents

• an additional supplemental retirement benefit equal to the increased benefit that the participant would have received under the Orbital ATK, Inc. Defined Benefit
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and/or Orbital ATK, Inc. Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that would have occurred if:
(i) the additional age and service would have been credited during the three-year period (for Tier 1 Participants) or two-year period (for Tier 2 Participants)
following the date of the termination, based on the current base salary and payments received under any annual incentive plan during the year preceding
termination for the purpose of calculating recognizable compensation, and (ii) the participant had contributed the maximum amounts allowable for before-tax or
Roth 401(k) contributions to Orbital ATK's 401(k) plan during the three-year period (for Tier 1 Participants) or two-year period (for Tier 2 Participants) following
the date of termination; 

• a cash amount, determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, with a value equal to any perquisite allowance that
would have been provided to the participant for a period of one year following the date of termination; and 

• payment for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in good faith by the participant to obtain benefits if Orbital ATK does not pay benefits under the plan.

        After five years of service in the specific Tier 1 officer position, each element of compensation payable to a Tier 1 Participant that is multiplied by three, as described above,
will be reduced by an increment of 0.2 on each of the fifth through ninth anniversaries of the date of service in that position, for a total decrease from three times compensation to
two times compensation over that five-year period. Assuming an effective time of February 1, 2018, the multiple for each of Messrs. Thompson, Pierce, Larson, and McCabe will
be three.

        The 2013 ISP includes a "280G cut back provision" and cuts back payments provided under the 2013 ISP above the limit established under Section 280G of the Code in
order to avoid the imposition of the excise tax provided by Section 4999 of the Code.

        The following table sets forth the amount that each executive officer (other than Mr. Lehr, who participates in the 2015 ISP only) would be entitled to receive under the 2013
ISP upon a "qualifying termination" in connection with the consummation of the merger, assuming an effective time of February 1, 2018. The value of performance shares
assumes that the executive officers do not waive their rights under the 2013 ISP or 2015 ISP, as applicable, and therefore do not receive the Northrop Grumman retention grant.

2013 ISP 

        Plan Provisions under the 2015 ISP.    Mr. Lehr is currently the only executive officer that participates in the 2015 ISP. However, the 2015 ISP will apply to each other
executive officer if the merger is completed after February 9, 2018. Under the 2015 ISP, in the event of a "qualifying termination," which is generally an involuntary termination
of employment without "cause" or a voluntary termination of employment for "good reason" (i) within six months after a "change event" and no more than six months prior to a
"change in control" (in limited circumstances) or (ii) within two years following a "change in control" (each such term as defined in the 2015 ISP), each participant in the 2015
ISP will be eligible to receive:

• a cash payment equal to two times the participant's annual base salary and current annual cash incentive amount opportunity for which the participant is eligible,
assuming the target level of performance had been achieved with respect to the annual cash incentive; 

• a prorated portion of the annual cash incentive payment for which the participant is eligible for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, calculated based on
the target level of performance; 

• a cash payment equal to the cash amount the participant would receive under any long-term cash incentive plan assuming target performance had been achieved; 

• immediate full vesting and payment of any outstanding stock awards, including performance vesting stock awards, with payment of any outstanding performance
vesting stock awards at the target level of performance; and 

• a cash payment equal to the value of benefits that Orbital ATK would have provided to the participant under Orbital ATK's group health plan for a period of two
years following termination.

        The 2015 ISP includes a "280G best after-tax" provision and cuts back payments provided under the 2015 ISP above the limit established under Section 280G of the Code to
the extent doing so would result in the executive officer receiving a larger after-tax amount than if he or she received the entire payment.

Table of Contents

        The following table sets forth the amount that each executive officer would be entitled to receive upon a "qualifying termination" in connection with the consummation of
the merger under the 2015 ISP, assuming an effective time of February 10, 2018 (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the 2015 ISP would not apply to any executive officer other
than Mr. Lehr unless the merger is completed after February 9, 2018). The value of performance shares assumes that the executive officers do not waive their rights under the
2013 ISP or 2015 ISP, as applicable, and therefore do not receive the Northrop Grumman retention grant.

2015 ISP 

Indemnification and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Orbital ATK's directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage as a result of
the surviving corporation assuming all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
merger existing in favor of any such Orbital ATK director or executive officer. See "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on page 77 for
additional information regarding such indemnification and insurance coverage.

Golden Parachute Compensation

        The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, regarding certain compensation that each of our named
executive officers will or may be paid in connection with the merger. Our "named executive officers" for this purpose are David W. Thompson, Garrett E. Pierce, Blake E.
Larson, Frank L. Culbertson, and Scott L. Lehr. The figures in the table are estimated based on compensation and benefit levels as of September 21, 2017, and based on the
assumption that the effective time of the merger will be February 1, 2018, and that each of the named executive officers will incur a "qualifying termination" immediately
following the merger. If the effective date of the merger occurs after February 9, 2018, the scheduled termination of the 2013 ISP, the named executive officers will only be
eligible to receive benefits under the 2015 ISP and the amounts they receive will be lower than those shown in the following table. Additionally, as noted above, certain named
executive officers may waive their right to receive benefits under the 2013 ISP or 2015 ISP in advance of the merger and would not become eligible for the benefits under the
2013 ISP or 2015 ISP. As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below determined using the

per share value of common stock have been calculated based on a per share price of common stock of $134.50 (the merger consideration). As a result of the foregoing
assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

        The merger-related compensation payable to our named executive officers is the subject of a non-binding advisory vote of the stockholders, as described under the section of
this proxy statement entitled "Proposal 2: Approval of Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Compensation" beginning on page 93. For additional details regarding the terms of the

(1) In accordance with the terms of the 2013 ISP, or in the case of Mr. Lehr, the 2015 ISP, each executive named executive officer is entitled to the
following cash severance in the event of a termination without "cause" (other than due to death or disability) or for "good reason" (i) under the 2013 ISP
within 12 months after a "change event" and no more than 12 months prior to the merger (in limited circumstances) or within three years following the
merger or (ii) under the 2015 ISP within six months after a "change event" and no more than six months prior to the merger (in limited circumstances)
or within 2 years following the merger: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to three times (for Messrs. Thompson, Pierce, and Larson) or two times (for
Messrs. Culbertson and Lehr) the sum of the executive's annual base salary in effect on the date of termination and the executive's then current target
bonus, (b) a pro-rata bonus for the year of termination, paid at target for Mr. Lehr and for the other named executive officers paid at target if termination
is during the first three quarters of the fiscal year and at the greater of target and projected performance if termination occurs in the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year, (c) except for Mr. Lehr, the maximum annual match the named executive officer would have received under Orbital ATK's 401(k) plan for
three years (or two years in the case of Mr. Culbertson), assuming the maximum annual contribution under the 401(k) plan, and (d) a lump sum cash
payment equal to the value of the benefits that would have been provided to the named executive officer under Orbital ATK's group health plan for a
period of three years (for Messrs. Thompson, Pierce, and Larson) or two years (for Messrs. Culbertson and Lehr) following termination. Orbital ATK
does not provide any long-term cash incentives or perquisites to any named executive officer. The amount reflected in the table above does not include
the named executive officer's annual base salary and other compensation earned prior to the date of termination to the extent not already paid or
payment

entitled "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger." For the avoidance of doubt, the equity column does not include outstanding
vested options that will be paid in connection with the merger. The value of performance shares assumes the named executive officers do not waive their
rights under the 2013 ISP or 2015 ISP, as applicable, and are therefore not eligible for the Northrop Grumman retention grant. As required by applicable
SEC rules, all amounts determined in this column are calculated using a per share price of common stock of $134.50 (the merger consideration). While
the 2013 ISP and 2015 ISP provisions relating to equity awards provide for "double trigger" acceleration, the merger agreement provides for "single
trigger" acceleration of equity in connection with the merger. For more information, see the discussion in the section above entitled "—Interests of
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

prior to the merger (in limited circumstances) or within three years following the merger. Mr. Lehr is not a participant in the 2013 ISP and is not eligible
for the retirement benefits. Each amount is attributable to a "double trigger" arrangement and is based upon actuarial valuations as of December 31,
2016 (the most recent valuations available).

No Financing Condition; Financing 

        The merger is not subject to a financing condition. Northrop Grumman has represented that it will have on the closing date sufficient funds available through credit
arrangements or otherwise to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all related fees required to be paid by Northrop Grumman and the surviving corporation. At the time of
the execution of the merger agreement, Northrop Grumman delivered to Orbital ATK an executed commitment letter pursuant to which Northrop Grumman's financing source
agreed to provide debt financing for the merger. On October 13, 2017, Northrop Grumman issued $8.25 billion of unsecured senior notes. Northrop Grumman intends to use the
net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, together with cash on hand, to finance the Orbital ATK acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. As a result of the
issuance of the senior unsecured notes, Northrop Grumman terminated the commitment letter.

Regulatory Approvals 

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which provides that the merger may not be completed until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is
terminated or expires, and the requirements of the European Commission with respect to the compatibility of the merger with the common market under the Council Regulation.
On October 4, 2017, Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman filed the notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Premerger Notification Office of the Federal Trade Commission.

        The waiting period in the EU begins with the filing of the requisite notification by Northrop Grumman to the European Commission which will be made after the conclusion
of the pre-notification discussions with the European Commission. The parties expect that these pre-notification discussions will continue for some weeks before Northrop
Grumman files the requisite notification with the European Commission. The initial review period (the "Phase I period") expires on the 25th business day following the filing
with the European Commission. The Phase I period may be extended to 35 business days if the European Commission receives a referral request from an EU member state or the
parties offer remedies to resolve any competition issues. If the European Commission decides to open a Phase II investigation or the matter is referred to any EU member state
for national review, the waiting period would be extended.

        At any time before or after the effective time of the merger, the U.S. reviewing antitrust authority or another person could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking a rescission or other unwinding of the merger,
or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. The European Commission could permit completion subject to regulatory conditions or prohibit the
merger. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.

Delisting and Deregistration of Common Stock 

        Upon completion of the merger, the common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the NYSE and will subsequently be deregistered under the
Exchange Act.

(4) These amounts are subject to applicable withholdings and could be reduced (i) under the 2013 ISP to the extent the payments would be considered a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or (ii) under the 2015 ISP to the extent the payments would be considered a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code if such reduction would give the named executive officer a better after-tax result
than if he received the payments in full. Based on current assumptions, Mr. Thompson would be subject to a cutback under the 2013 ISP due to
application of Section 280G of the Code.

Litigation Relating to the Merger 

        At least five purported class actions challenging the merger have been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia: the Lickteig Action, Ayzin
Action, Sedon Action, Berg Action and Simnowitz Action. The Lickteig Action and Berg Action name as defendants Orbital ATK, Oribtal ATK's directors, Northrop Grumman
and Sub. The Ayzin Action, Sedon Action and Simnowitz Action name as defendants Orbital ATK and Orbital ATK's directors. The Actions allege certain violations of the
Exchange Act and seek, among other things, damages, attorneys' fees and injunctive relief to prevent the merger from closing. Orbital ATK believes that the Actions lack merit
and intend to defend against them vigorously.

        If the Actions are not resolved on a timely basis, the Actions could delay consummation of the merger and result in additional costs to Orbital ATK, including costs
associated with the indemnification of directors. Additional plaintiffs may file lawsuits against Orbital ATK and/or our directors and officers in connection with the merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and which we incorporate
by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to
you. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the terms of the merger
agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding Representations, Warranties and Covenants in the Merger Agreement 

        In reviewing the merger agreement and this summary, please remember that they have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger
agreement and are not intended to provide any other factual information about Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman or any of their respective subsidiaries. The merger agreement
contains representations and warranties and covenants by each of the parties to the merger agreement, which are summarized below. These representations, warranties and
covenants, which are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiation of the terms of the merger agreement, have been made
solely for the benefit of the other parties to the merger agreement and:

• were not intended as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; 

• have been qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the merger agreement, which
disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement; and 

• may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by you or other investors.

        Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement and described below may have changed since
the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation, warranty or covenant may have been included in this proxy
statement or in other public filings Orbital ATK or Northrop Grumman have made with the SEC. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the
merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. See "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 99.

The Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, will be merged with and into Orbital ATK, with
Orbital ATK continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Orbital ATK will cease to be an independent, publicly-traded company and will become a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. The merger will be effective at the time a certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or, to the
extent legally permissible, at a later time, if agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State).

Merger Consideration 

        Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist and will be converted into the
right to receive $134.50 in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, other than excluded shares.

Table of Contents

Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws 

        The directors of Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will, from and after the effective time of the merger, be the directors of the surviving corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will, from and after the effective time of the merger, be the officers of the surviving corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors have been duly elected and qualified.

        The certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended in the merger to be in the form of the certificate of incorporation attached as an exhibit to the
merger agreement, until changed or amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable law. The bylaws of Sub in effect immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation (except that references therein to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to Orbital ATK, Inc.), until
changed or amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable law.

Treatment of Equity Awards 

        Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase common stock that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price applicable to such option, less any applicable tax withholding. If the exercise price applicable to
shares of common stock subject to an option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the option shall terminate and be canceled for no consideration.

        Restricted Shares.    Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each restricted share that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Performance Shares.    If the closing date occurs prior to the date on which performance shares with respect to the 2015-2017 performance period would vest in the ordinary
course of business, such performance shares will become vested based on achievement of performance metrics at the greater of target performance or actual performance and will
be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such performance share immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above), and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax
withholding.

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is
held by an individual who is not a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans or who waives participation in Orbital ATK's income security plans prior to the
effective time of the merger, will become vested based on deemed achievement of target performance, pro-rated based on the number of days elapsed from the beginning of the
performance period through and including the closing date over the total number of days from the beginning of the scheduled performance period through the end of the
performance period. Such performance shares will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above), and (ii) the
merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. For each performance share that is forfeited due to pro-ration, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective
time of the merger, Northrop Grumman will grant each holder thereof who remains an employee as of the grant date with a "Northrop Grumman retention grant" of Northrop
Grumman

Table of Contents

restricted stock units with a value equal to two times the value of such forfeited performance shares. One-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on March 1,
2019, and the remaining one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant will vest on March 1, 2020, in each case subject to continued employment with Northrop Grumman
and its subsidiaries as of such dates; provided, however, that holders of Northrop Grumman retention grants who are involuntarily terminated other than for cause prior to
March 1, 2019, will vest in one-half of the Northrop Grumman retention grant upon such termination and forfeit the remaining one-half.

        Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each performance share with respect to the 2016-2018 or 2017-2019 performance period that is outstanding and that is
held by an individual who is a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans and who does not waive participation therein prior to the effective time, will become
vested based on deemed achievement of target performance and will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
common stock subject to such performance share immediately prior to the effective time (after taking into account the vesting in connection with the merger described above),
and (ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Deferred Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each deferred stock unit that is outstanding will automatically become fully vested and will be converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such deferred stock unit immediately prior to the effective time, and
(ii) the merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. Such payment will be paid in accordance with and subject to the deferral elections applicable to such deferred
stock units as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Phantom Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each phantom stock unit that is outstanding will become fully vested and will be converted into the right to
receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such phantom stock unit immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) the
merger consideration, less any applicable tax withholding. Such payment will be paid in accordance with and subject to the deferral elections applicable to such phantom stock
units as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Notwithstanding the above, if any options, restricted shares, performance shares, or deferred stock units are granted following the date of the merger agreement and prior to
the effective time of the merger, the vesting of such awards will instead be pro-rated based on the number of days from the grant date (or for performance shares, from the
beginning of the performance period) through and including the closing date over the number of days from the grant date through the final regularly scheduled vesting date of
such award (or for performance shares, from the beginning to the end of the performance period).

        An individual who is a participant in one of Orbital ATK's income security plans and who does not waive participation therein prior to the effective time of the merger has
certain rights as provided in the applicable income security plan. The terms of the merger agreement do not alter the participant's rights under the income security plans. See "The
Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Change in Control Severance" beginning on page 58.

Stockholders Seeking Appraisal 

        The merger agreement provides that shares of common stock held by those stockholders who are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal will not be converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration, but will instead be converted into the right to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of our common stock as
determined in accordance with Delaware law. If a holder fails to perfect, or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal of their shares of common stock,
his, her or its shares will be treated as if they had been converted at the effective time of the merger into and become exchangeable for the merger consideration without

interest and the stockholder's right to appraisal will be extinguished. Orbital ATK must give Northrop Grumman prompt notice of demands for appraisal and Orbital ATK may
not make a payment with respect to a demand for appraisal or settle or offer to settle or negotiate any such demands without Northrop Grumman's prior written consent.

        The fair value of shares of our common stock as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL may be more or less than (or the same as) the merger
consideration. Stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights must precisely follow specific procedures. See "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 88.

Payment for the Shares 

        Northrop Grumman will designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to Orbital ATK, and enter into an agreement with the paying agent that is reasonably acceptable to
Orbital ATK, to make payment of the merger consideration as contemplated by the merger agreement. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Northrop Grumman will deposit
with the paying agent the cash in immediately available funds in an amount necessary for the payment of the aggregate merger consideration to the stockholders on a timely
basis.

        As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send each holder of record of a certificate representing shares of common
stock converted into the right to receive the merger consideration a customary letter of transmittal and instructions advising such holder on how to surrender such shares of
common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. The paying agent will promptly pay such holders the merger consideration upon (i) the surrender of a certificate for
cancelation to the paying agent and (ii) delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonable required by the paying agent. Interest will not
be paid or accrue in respect of cash payments. The amount of any cash payments paid to you will be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes. YOU SHOULD NOT
SURRENDER YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITHOUT A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

        If any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such stock certificate to be lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the surviving
corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such stock certificate, the paying agent or the surviving corporation, as the case
may be, shall pay the merger consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed stock certificate.

        In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of common stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of Orbital ATK, payment of the merger consideration in
exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the stock certificate so surrendered is registered if such certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the surviving corporation
that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

        For holders of uncertificated shares of common stock, as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send (i) materials
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the merger and the conversion of its uncertificated shares into the right to receive the merger consideration and (ii) a check in an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of merger consideration less any applicable withholding taxes to which such holder is entitled.

Meeting of Our Stockholders 

        Orbital ATK has agreed to, as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of our stockholders for the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon the adoption of the merger agreement and voting on the adjournment proposal and the

stockholders at such time or (b) Orbital ATK will not receive proxies sufficient to obtain the required approval for the merger proposal, whether or not a quorum is present, (ii) it
is necessary to postpone or adjourn the special meeting to ensure that any required amendment or supplement to this proxy statement is mailed to holders of shares of common
stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the special meeting or (iii) subject to certain limitations, such postponement or adjournment is required by law or a court
or any other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in connection with any actions in connection with the merger agreement or the merger or has been requested by the
SEC or its staff.

Efforts to Complete the Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman and Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

of Northrop Grumman do not receive credit for prior service.

        Northrop Grumman will use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations, exclusions or eligibility waiting periods as to preexisting conditions and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements under any health, dental, vision or other welfare plans maintained by Northrop Grumman to the extent such conditions

co-payments and deductibles paid in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under Orbital ATK's plans.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        The merger agreement provides that following the merger, the surviving corporation will assume all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger existing in favor of any person who is or prior to the effective time of the merger becomes or has been at
any time prior to the date of the merger agreement a director or officer of Orbital ATK or any of its subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of Orbital ATK or its subsidiaries as in effect on the date of the merger
agreement, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder for any indemnified party. Prior to the
effective time of the merger, Orbital ATK shall purchase a six-year "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, subject to a cap on aggregate premiums, for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the merger.

No Financing Condition; Financing 

        Northrop Grumman has represented that it will have sufficient funds available through credit arrangements or otherwise to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all
related fees required to be paid by Northrop Grumman and the surviving corporation. At the time of the execution of the merger agreement, Northrop Grumman delivered to
Orbital ATK an executed commitment letter pursuant to which Northrop Grumman's financing source agreed to provide debt financing for the merger. On October 13, 2017,
Northrop Grumman issued $8.25 billion of unsecured senior notes. Northrop Grumman intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes, together with cash
on hand, to finance the Orbital ATK acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. As a result of the issuance of the senior unsecured notes, Northrop Grumman terminated the
commitment letter.

expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), other than for such failures to be true and correct, without giving effect to any
qualifications as to materiality or material adverse effect, that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Northrop Grumman;

• Northrop Grumman and Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by them under the merger agreement at or prior
to the closing date of the merger; and 

• Orbital ATK shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Northrop Grumman by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of Northrop
Grumman certifying satisfaction of each of the above conditions.

        A "material adverse effect" with respect to Northrop Grumman means any state of facts, change, development, event, effect, condition, occurrence, action or omission that,
individually or in the aggregate, prevents or materially delays, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, the ability of Northrop Grumman or Sub to
complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals 

        The merger agreement provides that Orbital ATK (i) shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit its or their representatives to, directly
or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any takeover proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to a takeover proposal or (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person (or any representative thereof) any information with respect to or in connection with, or otherwise knowingly cooperate with any person with respect to, any
takeover proposal or any inquiries or proposals that would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to a takeover proposal, (ii) shall and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and
their respective representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any person conducted prior to the entry
into the merger agreement with respect to any takeover proposal or any inquiries or proposals that would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to a takeover proposal and
(iii) shall promptly, and in any event within two days following the date of the merger agreement, request, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the prompt
return or written acknowledgment of destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any person within 24 months prior to the date of the merger agreement for
the purposes of evaluating a possible takeover proposal to the extent that Orbital ATK is entitled to have such documents returned or destroyed.

        Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries shall be permitted to release any person from or waive any standstill provision or similar provision with respect to any capital stock of
Orbital ATK or any of its subsidiaries in any agreement to which Orbital ATK or any of its subsidiaries is a party solely to the extent that (x) such provision would otherwise
prohibit the counterparty thereto from making a confidential takeover proposal directly to the Orbital ATK Board in accordance with the merger agreement and (y) the Orbital
ATK Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Orbital ATK under applicable law. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the foregoing sentence, Orbital ATK shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, enforce the
standstill provisions of any such agreement.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing restriction, at any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited takeover proposal
received after the execution of the merger agreement which did not result from a material breach of the no solicitation provision of the merger agreement, (x) Orbital ATK and its
representatives may contact the person proposing such takeover proposal or the representatives of such person solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (y) if the
Orbital ATK Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that

takeover proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of Orbital ATK under applicable law, Orbital ATK may, and may permit and authorize its subsidiaries and its representatives and its subsidiaries'
representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with, among other things, a requirement under the merger agreement that Orbital ATK notify Northrop Grumman of the
receipt of any takeover proposal or inquiry related thereto, (1) furnish information with respect to Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries to the person making such takeover proposal
(and its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are no less restrictive of such person than those contained in the confidentiality
agreement between Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman; provided that all such information had been provided, or is concurrently provided, to Northrop Grumman, and
(2) participate in discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person making such takeover proposal (and its representatives) regarding such takeover proposal.

        The term "takeover proposal" means any proposal or offer from any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than Northrop Grumman or
any of its subsidiaries) providing for, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any (i) merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Orbital ATK or (ii) direct or indirect acquisition, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer,
exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or
similar transaction, of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) or assets of Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock or of any class
of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the subsidiaries of Orbital ATK which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or businesses
referred to in clause (A) above.

        The term "superior proposal" means any binding bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provision of the
merger agreement made by any person (other than Northrop Grumman or any of its subsidiaries) that, if completed, would result in such person (or, in the case of a direct merger
between such person and Orbital ATK, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of Orbital ATK's common stock or the outstanding
voting power of Orbital ATK or all or substantially all the assets of Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith determination of the
Orbital ATK Board (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), (i) is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of Orbital ATK than the consideration payable in the merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and
the merger agreement (including any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Northrop Grumman in response to such superior proposal or otherwise)) and
(ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

Changes in Board Recommendation; Termination For Superior Proposal 

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, neither the Orbital ATK Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify
in a manner adverse to Northrop Grumman or Sub, or propose publicly to do so, the recommendation or declaration of advisability with respect to the merger agreement or
merger or (ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable (or agree to do any of the foregoing) any takeover proposal.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, prior to the approval of the Orbital ATK stockholders of the merger proposal, the Orbital ATK Board may, under certain
circumstances, effect an adverse

recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, only if the Orbital ATK Board has
determined in good faith, after, among other things, consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Orbital ATK under applicable law. Prior to effecting an adverse recommendation change
or terminating the merger agreement pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, the Orbital ATK Board must provide written notice to Northrop
Grumman at least three business days prior to such action and during such notice period must negotiate in good faith with Northrop Grumman regarding, and consider in good
faith, any revisions to the merger agreement proposed in writing by Northrop Grumman.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the merger:

• by mutual written consent of Orbital ATK, Northrop Grumman and Sub; 

• by either Orbital ATK or Northrop Grumman: 

• if the merger shall not have been completed by September 17, 2018 (the "outside date"), for any reason, except that if, on such date, the condition to
closing with respect to termination or expiration of any waiting period under the HSR Act and the European Commission's finding the merger to be
compatible with the common market under the Council Regulation, or having been deemed to have done so pursuant to Article 10(6) of the Council
Regulation, but all other conditions to closing either have been fulfilled or are then capable of being fulfilled, then the outside date shall, without any
action on the part of the parties to the merger agreement, be extended to December 17, 2018, and provided, further that this right to terminate the merger
agreement is not available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the merger to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement; 

• if any court of competent jurisdiction issues or enters a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or other legal
restraint or prohibition that has the effect of preventing the consummation of the merger and such legal restraint has become final and non-appealable; or 

• if the special meeting of stockholders shall have been held and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of
common stock shall not have been obtained thereat or any adjournment or postponement thereof; 

• by Northrop Grumman: 

• if, prior to the receipt of stockholder approval, the Orbital ATK Board or any committee thereof (A) withholds, withdraws, modifies or qualifies in a
manner adverse to Northrop Grumman or Sub, or proposes publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Northrop Grumman
or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Orbital ATK Board or any such committee of the merger agreement or the merger or
(B) recommends, declares advisable or proposes to recommend or declare advisable the approval or adoption of any takeover proposal or resolves or
agrees to take any such action, or adopts or approves any takeover proposal;

Grumman shall not have this right to terminate the merger agreement if Northrop Grumman or Sub is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in the merger agreement) or (ii) any court of competent jurisdiction issues or enters a temporary restraining order,

ATK special meeting of stockholders was held and approval of the stockholders was not obtained or (B) Northrop Grumman because Orbital ATK breached any of
its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (a) gave rise to the failure of the applicable condition set forth under "—Conditions to the Merger—Conditions to Northrop Grumman's and Sub's
Obligations" and (b) was incapable of being cured or was not cured by Orbital ATK by the date that was 30 business days after receipt of written notice from

        All out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by the party incurring such
cost or expenses.

Amendment, Extension and Waiver 

        The parties may amend provisions of the merger agreement at any time, except that after approval of Orbital ATK's stockholders has been obtained, no amendment that
requires further approval by stockholders of Orbital ATK is permitted without the further approval of such stockholders. All such amendments must be in writing and signed by
each of the parties, except that sections pursuant to which financing sources and financing sources related parties are express third party beneficiaries, may not be amended,
modified, supplemented or waived in a manner adverse to them without the express written consent of the financing sources.

agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to the merger agreement to assert any of its rights under the merger agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER 

        The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of common stock whose shares are converted to cash in the merger.
This summary does not address any tax consequences of the merger arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction or U.S. federal laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws and does not address tax considerations applicable to holders who receive cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights. This discussion is based on the Code,
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, court decisions and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date hereof
and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be applicable to holders of common stock in light of their particular circumstances or holders of common stock subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income
tax law, such as:

• entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, S corporations or other pass-through entities; 

• persons who hold common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, synthetic security, conversion transaction or other integrated investment or risk
reduction transaction; 

• U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; 

• U.S. expatriates; 

• persons who acquired common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; 

• persons subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax; 

• banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions; 

• regulated investment companies; 

• real estate investment trusts; 

• tax-exempt organizations; 

• brokers or dealers in securities or foreign currencies; and 

• traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment.

        Stockholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of
common stock pursuant to the merger (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws).

        If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of common stock, the tax treatment of a
partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership holding shares of common stock are
encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger.

        This discussion applies only to Orbital ATK stockholders that hold their shares of common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Orbital ATK common stock that is:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

Table of Contents

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its
political subdivisions; 

• a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

        A "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner (other than a partnership) of Orbital ATK common stock that is not a U.S. holder.

U.S. Holders

Payments with Respect to Shares

        The exchange of shares of common stock for cash in the merger will generally be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a
U.S. holder whose shares of common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder's
adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of common stock
(i.e., shares of common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) owned by a U.S. holder. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. holder's holding period for the shares of common stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders
are generally subject to reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may
be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 28%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to
the merger, unless such holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a
U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

Non-U.S. Holders

Payments with Respect to Shares

        A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty,
is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by the non-U.S. holder), in which
case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation,
such corporation may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty);

• the non-U.S. holder is a non-resident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other
conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% tax on the non-U.S. holder's net gain realized in the merger, which may
be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any; or 

• Orbital ATK is, or has been at any time during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending on the date of the merger and (ii) the period during which the non-U.S.
holder held shares of our common stock, a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the non-U.S. holder owned
(actually or constructively) more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at any time during the applicable period. Orbital ATK believes that it is
not, and has not been during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger, a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, although there can be no assurances in this regard.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding will apply with respect to the cash received by a non-U.S.
holder pursuant to the merger, unless such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, you have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the "fair value" of your shares of common stock as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the court, but exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, in lieu of the merger consideration you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights.
Orbital ATK stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Orbital ATK will
require strict compliance with the statutory procedures.

        The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed properly and in a timely manner by an
Orbital ATK stockholder in order to dissent from the merger and perfect appraisal rights.

        This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of
which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in a termination or
waiver of your appraisal rights. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising appraisal rights, stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are
encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. This summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a "stockholder" are to the record holder of shares of common
stock, unless otherwise indicated.

        Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the stockholders' meeting where the
merger agreement will be voted on that appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with such notice. This proxy statement
constitutes Orbital ATK's notice to Orbital ATK stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the merger in compliance with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached hereto as Annex C. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully
review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex C to this proxy statement, since failure to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.

        If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions.

• You must deliver to Orbital ATK a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger agreement is taken. This written demand
for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the merger agreement. Voting against or
failing to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. 

• You must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement in person at the special meeting or
the submission of a proxy in favor of the merger agreement by mail, over the Internet or by telephone (that is not subsequently revoked), will constitute a waiver
of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A submitted proxy that does not
contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Therefore, an Orbital ATK stockholder who submits a
proxy and who wishes to exercise and perfect appraisal rights must vote against the merger agreement, abstain

from voting on the merger agreement or revoke any previously submitted proxy in favor of the merger agreement.

• You must continue to hold your shares of common stock through the effective date of the merger. Therefore, an Orbital ATK stockholder who is the record holder
of shares of common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made but who thereafter transfers the shares prior to the effective date of the merger
will lose any right to appraisal with respect to such shares.

        If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights
with respect to your shares of common stock.

        All demands for appraisal should be addressed to Orbital ATK, Inc., 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166, Attn: Corporate Secretary, and must be delivered before the vote
on the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting and must be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of common stock, fully and correctly, as the
stockholder's name appears in the stock ledger. The demand must reasonably inform Orbital ATK of the identity of the Orbital ATK stockholder, and the intention of the Orbital
ATK stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock.

        Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of common stock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to Orbital ATK. The beneficial holder must, in
such cases, have the registered owner, such as a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares. If shares of common stock
are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made by or for the fiduciary, and if the
shares of common stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner or owners, and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner. A record owner, such as a broker, who
holds shares of common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the shares of common stock held for one or more beneficial
owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of common stock as to which appraisal is
sought. Where no number of shares is expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner.

        If you hold your shares of common stock in an account with a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee, and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you are urged to
consult with your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal.

        Within 10 days after the closing date of the merger, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the merger has become effective to each former Orbital ATK
stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. At any time within 60 days after the
effective time of the merger, any former Orbital ATK stockholder who has demanded an appraisal and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a
proceeding as a named party, will have the right to withdraw the demand for appraisal and to accept the cash payment specified by the merger agreement for his, her or its shares
of common stock; after this 60-day period, the former Orbital ATK stockholder may withdraw such demand for appraisal only with the written consent of the surviving
corporation. Within 120 days after the closing date of the merger, any former Orbital ATK stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL will, upon written
request to the surviving corporation, be entitled to receive a written

statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been
received, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person's own name, request from the surviving corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to
the requesting former Orbital ATK stockholder within 10 days after such written request is received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period
for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Within 120 days after the closing date of the merger, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or any former
Orbital ATK stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of common stock held by Orbital ATK stockholders
who have complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights. A person who was the beneficial owner of shares of
common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the
filing of the petition by a former Orbital ATK stockholder, service of a copy of such petition must be made upon Orbital ATK, as the surviving corporation. The surviving
corporation has no obligation to file such a petition if there are dissenting former Orbital ATK stockholders. Accordingly, the failure of a former Orbital ATK stockholder to file
such a petition within the period specified could nullify the former Orbital ATK stockholder's previously written demand for appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of
Orbital ATK to file an appraisal petition, and Orbital ATK stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Orbital ATK will file such a petition or that
Orbital ATK will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, Orbital ATK stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should
initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        If a petition for appraisal is timely filed by a former Orbital ATK stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation
will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all former Orbital ATK stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares, and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving corporation. After notice is made to dissenting former Orbital ATK stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares as required by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition to determine those former Orbital ATK stockholders who have
complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights thereunder. Under Delaware law, the Delaware Court of Chancery may require
former stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their shares and who held stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any such former stockholder who held stock represented by certificates fails to comply with
that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that former stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the appraisal
proceeding unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds $1 million.

        After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which former Orbital ATK stockholders are entitled to appraisal of their shares of common stock, the appraisal proceeding
will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of common stock held by former Orbital ATK stockholders who have complied with the

requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, determining the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances
described below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment
in the appraisal proceeding). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly, and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge), as
established from time to time during the period between the closing date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the fair value is determined, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines,
to the former Orbital ATK stockholders entitled to receive the same (in the case of shares represented by certificates, payment will not be made until such certificates are
surrendered to the surviving corporation). At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each former stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid and the fair value of the shares
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

        In determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP,  Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "fair price obviously requires
consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company."

        Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co.
v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies
only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to
mean that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of
speculation, may be considered."

        You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the
value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement if you did not seek appraisal of your shares. Investment banking opinions as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the merger consideration are not necessarily opinions as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the former Orbital ATK stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding by the
Delaware Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a former Orbital ATK stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any former Orbital ATK stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any former Orbital ATK stockholder who had
demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose, or to receive payments of dividends or
any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date prior to the effective time of the merger; however, if no petition for
appraisal is filed within 120 days after the

effective time of the merger, or if the former Orbital ATK stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal, and an acceptance of the terms of the
merger within 60 days after the effective time of the merger (or thereafter with approval of the surviving corporation), then the right of that former Orbital ATK stockholder to
appraisal will cease and that former Orbital ATK stockholder will be entitled to receive the cash payment for shares of his, her or its shares of common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any former Orbital ATK stockholder without the prior approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any former Orbital ATK stockholder who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will maintain the right to withdraw its demand for appraisal, and to accept the cash that
such holder would have received pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.

        In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Orbital ATK stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal rights should consult their
legal advisors. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, Section 262 of the DGCL will govern.

PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL OF ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON COMPENSATION 

        Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are required to submit a proposal to our stockholders for a non-binding,
advisory vote to approve certain compensation that will or may be paid to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. This proposal, which we refer to as the
"compensation proposal," gives our stockholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger. This compensation is summarized in the table captioned "Golden Parachute Compensation" in the section entitled "The
Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 51, including the footnotes to the table. In accordance with the requirements of Section
14A of the Exchange Act, Orbital ATK is requesting stockholders to approve the following resolution, on a non-binding advisory basis.

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid to Orbital ATK's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the table captioned
"Golden Parachute Compensation" in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," including in the associated
narrative discussion, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be payable, are hereby APPROVED."

        The Orbital ATK Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. The
Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders approve, by advisory vote, the compensation that will or may be paid to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger.

        The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and
vote not to approve the compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Orbital ATK.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of
the outcome of the vote on the compensation proposal.

        Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the special meeting and
entitled to vote thereon.

        If you fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal, assuming a
quorum is present at the special meeting. If you mark your proxy to abstain or provide voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the compensation
proposal.

        The Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the compensation proposal.

        If you return a properly executed proxy (including proxies received via the Internet or by telephone), but do not indicate instructions on your proxy, your shares of common
stock represented by such proxy will be voted "FOR" the compensation proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        Stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the special meeting and entitled
to vote thereon.

        If you fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal, assuming a
quorum is present at the special meeting. If you mark your proxy to abstain or provide voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the adjournment
proposal.

        The Orbital ATK Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        If you return a properly executed proxy (including proxies received via the Internet or by telephone) but do not indicate instructions on your proxy, your shares of common
stock represented by such proxy will be voted "FOR" the adjournment proposal, if necessary.

MARKET PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION 

        Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol "OA." The following table sets forth on a per share basis the low and high sales prices of our
common stock as reported by the NYSE for the periods indicated:

        The closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on September 15, 2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger agreement, was $110.04 per
share. The closing price of common stock on the NYSE on October 23, 2017, the last trading day before the date of this proxy statement was $132.95 per share. As of the record
date, Orbital ATK had 57,646,130 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and Orbital ATK had approximately 4,626 holders of record.

        For the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, Orbital ATK paid three quarterly dividends of $0.32 per share, totaling approximately $55.4 million, and the most recent

liquidity position, financial condition, capital requirements and credit ratings, as well as the extent to which the payment of cash dividends may be restricted by covenants
contained in our debt instruments, including our 5.25% Senior Notes due 2021, 5.50% Senior Notes due 2023 and senior credit facility. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
Orbital ATK is permitted to, and intends to, continue paying a $0.32 per share quarterly cash dividend between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the
merger.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is completed on the expected timetable, Orbital ATK will not hold an annual meeting of its stockholders in 2018 (the "2018 annual meeting"). If, however, the
merger is not completed or is delayed, and our 2018 annual meeting is held, we expect that it will be held more than 30 days earlier than the date our annual meeting was held in
2017. We will provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2018 annual meeting will be held. If you would like to submit a proposal for us to include in
the proxy statement for our 2018 annual meeting, you must comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. In accordance with Rule 14a-8, you must also make sure that we
receive your proposal at our executive offices (sent c/o Corporate Secretary) within a reasonable time before Orbital ATK begins to print and send its proxy materials for the 2018
annual meeting. Any stockholder proposal included in our proxy statement will also be included on our form of proxy so that stockholders can indicate how they wish to vote
their shares on the proposal.

        If you would like to submit a proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 or nominate a person for election as a director at the 2018 annual meeting, you must comply with the advance
notice provisions of our bylaws. Due to the expectation that the 2018 annual meeting, if any, will be held more than 30 days earlier than the date our annual meeting was held in
2017, our bylaw provisions require that we receive your proposal or nomination at our executive offices (sent c/o Corporate Secretary) no later than the later of (i) 90 days prior
to the 2018 annual meeting and (ii) the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the public disclosure of the date of the 2018 annual meeting.

HOUSEHOLDING 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is
commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

        If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of this proxy
statement and wish to receive only one, please contact Orbital ATK at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166, attention of Corporate Secretary. Orbital ATK will promptly deliver,
upon oral or written request, a separate copy of this proxy statement to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests for additional copies
should be directed to Orbital ATK, Inc., at 45101 Warp Drive, Dulles, VA 20166, attention of Corporate Secretary or by telephone at (703) 406-5000.

Conversion of Securities 

        SECTION 2.01.    Conversion of Capital Stock.     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

        (a)    Capital Stock of Sub.    Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

        (b)    Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.    All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in

        (c)    Conversion of Company Common Stock.    Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than

$134.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and

appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence in book entry form that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL that are received by the
Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate, any such
demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

        SECTION 2.03.    Adjustments.     If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company
Common Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split or combination (including a reverse stock split), exchange, merger, consolidation or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar transaction or event, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.03 shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise
prohibited by this Agreement.

        SECTION 2.04.    Exchange of Certificates.     (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares (the "Paying Agent"), and in connection therewith,
shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in immediately available funds (such cash in immediately available funds, the "Exchange Fund") in an amount
necessary for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, it being understood that all
such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent and that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be turned over to Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(c), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, in the Exchange Fund additional cash in immediately
available funds so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund has sufficient funds available for Paying Agent to make all such payments.

        (b)    Exchange Procedure.    As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to (i) each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall include an
accompanying IRS Form W-9 or the applicable IRS Form W-8,

shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to
the Paying Agent and shall be in a customary form and have such other provisions as reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (ii) each holder of Uncertificated Shares (A) materials advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (B) a check in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and each Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.04, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

        (c)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.    All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. No cash payment with
respect to the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.04.

        (d)    No Liability.    None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration that would otherwise have been payable to a holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares has not received the Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to under this Section 2.04, and such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

        (e)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.

        (f)    Withholding Rights.    Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

        (g)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund or that had otherwise been made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and thereafter, subject to the
time limitations in Section 2.04(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such
holders or to holders of Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

Agreement (the "Company Letter") (with specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such disclosure relates; provided that disclosure of
information in any section of the Company Letter shall be deemed to qualify or apply to other Sections in this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such

organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the case of clause (i) above, with respect to the Company), or to have such power or authority,

        (t)    Organizational and Personal Conflicts.    To the knowledge of the Company, there are no activities or relationships between, on the one hand, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and, on the other hand, Parent, that would reasonably be expected to result in an organizational or personal conflict of interest, as defined by FAR,
as a result of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all organizational or personal conflict of interest (as defined by FAR) mitigation plans entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with any active program or proposal except for any noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to

existence of any prohibited organizational or personal conflict of interest in connection with any Government Contract or Government Bid that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        (u)    State Takeover Statutes.    Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Section 3.02(e), the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by
the Board of Directors of the Company referred to in Section 3.01(d) constitutes the only action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL) set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL to the extent, if any, such restrictions would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or compliance with the terms of this Agreement. No other state takeover or similar statute or regulation, and, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties in Section 3.02(e), no analogous provision in the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws, is applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

        (v)    Voting Requirements.    The affirmative vote at the Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of adopting this Agreement (the "Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
the Company's capital stock necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (w)    Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses.    No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
("Citigroup"), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements under which such fees or commissions are
payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees are payable.

        (x)    Opinion of Financial Advisor.    The Board of Directors of the Company has received an opinion of Citigroup to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion,
and based upon and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the stockholders of the
Company (other than holders of (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) Appraisal Shares) pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such
stockholders from a financial point of view, a copy of which opinion will be delivered to Parent, for informational purposes only, as promptly as reasonably practicable
upon receipt thereof by the Company.

Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement have been

enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws related

lapse of time or both) under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of Parent or Sub, (ii) any Contract or
Permit to or by which Parent or Sub is a party or bound or to or by which their respective properties or assets are subject or bound or otherwise under which Parent or Sub

Proxy Statement will, at the time it is filed with the SEC, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, as amended or supplemented at such date or time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

described in the Fee Letter), and as of the date of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties thereto, under the Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated in the Commitment Letter will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other contracts
directly related to the Financing to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party other than the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and any related customary
engagement letters and confidentiality agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment or other
fees which are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter.

and warranties made by the Company in Section 3.01, none of the Company nor any of its Representatives or any other person has made a representation or warranty to
Parent with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets of future results or future financial condition relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their

cause, the prompt return or written acknowledgment of destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any person within 24 months prior to the date of this
Agreement for the purposes of evaluating a possible Takeover Proposal to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such documents returned or destroyed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to release any person from or waive any standstill provision or similar provision with respect to any capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party solely to the extent that (x) such provision would
otherwise prohibit the counterparty thereto from making a confidential Takeover Proposal directly to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with this Section 4.02
and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal received after the execution of this Agreement which did not result from a material
breach of this Section 4.02, (x) the Company and its Representatives may contact the person proposing such Takeover Proposal or the Representatives of such person solely to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup
or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Company may, and may permit and
authorize its Subsidiaries and its Representatives and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c) and the other provisions of this
Agreement, (1) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are no less restrictive of such person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"); provided that all such information had been provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (2) participate in discussions or negotiations with, and only with,
the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.02(a) by any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company.

        For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
(other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) providing for, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any (I) merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or (II) direct or indirect acquisition, including by way of any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, license agreement or similar transaction, of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA (earnings before
interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the aggregate, directly or
indirectly hold the assets or businesses referred to in clause (A) above.

        For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any binding bona fide unsolicited written offer which did not result from a material breach of this
Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) that, if consummated, would result in such

person (or, in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the
Company Common Stock or the outstanding voting power of the Company or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which
offer, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), (1) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the consideration payable in the Merger (taking
into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise)) and (2) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

        (b)   Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration
of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (B) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or
declare advisable the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be expected to result in or
lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change under clause (A) of the definition thereof, or (y) in response to a Superior Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) to accept such Superior Proposal, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), only if the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, and after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that have been offered in writing by Parent in accordance with this Section 4.02(b), that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) unless (1) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
first provided written notice to Parent (an "Adverse Change Notice") at least three business days prior to such action that it is prepared to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor, and, if such action is in response to a Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal (including any financing thereof, to the extent such financing agreements are available) and (2) upon the end of such notice period, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have (aa) considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent by the end of such
notice period and (bb) determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Citigroup or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that (I) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (II) the failure
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment or

modification to the financial terms or conditions or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Change Notice and a new notice period
under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the three business day period referred to in clause (1) of this proviso shall instead be a two business day
period)). The Company agrees that, during the three or two business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or termination pursuant to
Section 7.01(f), the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires and is willing to do so)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

        (c)   In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any
event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that the Company
reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including
any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions and, if applicable, copies of any written requests, inquiries, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to
above, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall keep Parent (or its outside counsel) informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status, including any change to the
material terms and conditions, of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry, and the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.

        (d)   Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any such position or disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement.

Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company's stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto (including any oral response to comments), the Company (x) shall provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including any proposed oral response to comments), (y) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (z) shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of
Parent or its counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

        (b)   The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of the
information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the
Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on
behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed
with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock shall include the notice of appraisal
rights required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 262 that complies with applicable Law.

        (c)   The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval and voting on a proposal to adjourn the Stockholders Meeting (and, if
applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith), which meeting the Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint
that has the effect of preventing such action, cause to occur no later than the 35th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day
subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the date that the mailing of the Proxy Statement has been substantially completed (the "Stockholders Meeting");
provided that the Stockholders Meeting shall be held no earlier than the 50th calendar day after the date of this Agreement; and provided, further, that the Company, after
consultation with Parent, may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Stockholders Meeting if the Company
reasonably believes that (i)(A) the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time or (B) the Company will not receive proxies sufficient to obtain
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, (ii) it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting to ensure that any required amendment or

Proxy Statement is mailed to holders of Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholders Meeting or (iii) such postponement
or adjournment is required by Law or a court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction in connection with any actions in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or has been requested by the SEC or its staff, so long as, in the case of any postponement or
adjournment under clause (i) of this Section 5.01(c), the Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 30 calendar days without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that during the three business days prior to the date that the
Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent may direct the
Company to postpone the Stockholders Meeting for up to five business days and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws, the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than the next business day, postpone the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Parent's direction,
subject to the Company's right to postpone the Stockholders Meeting for a longer period pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The notice of the Stockholders
Meeting shall state that a proposal to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b), (x) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend to holders of Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
(y) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the Stockholder Approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
person of any Takeover Proposal or, other than with respect to the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 5.01(c), the making of any Adverse Recommendation
Change. The Company shall provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the Stockholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably
requested by Parent.

        SECTION 5.02.    Access to Information; Confidentiality.     (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's
Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours (under supervision of appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to afford access or furnish
information to the extent (i) relating to the minutes of the Company's Board of Directors or any committees thereof (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or
for the Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof) where the Company's Board of Directors or any such committee thereof discussed this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any similar transaction with any other person, including any Takeover Proposal, (ii) the Company determines in good
faith that affording such access or furnishing such information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or to furnish such information in a manner that does not jeopardize the attorney-client privilege), (iii) that
affording such access or furnishing such information would violate applicable Law or result in significant antitrust risk for the Company or its Subsidiaries or (iv) such request

applicable Law, Parent will hold, and will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

        (b)   Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly transition and
integration process in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the disruption to, and preserve the
value of, the business of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set
forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions and Consents from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other
persons and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act (which each of the parties hereto shall file, or cause to be
filed, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but not later than fifteen business days after the date hereof, such date to be determined by Parent in consultation
with the Company) and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, that may be required under the HSR Act or other applicable
antitrust, competition or pre-merger notification or trade regulation Laws of any jurisdiction (collectively, "Review Laws"), if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to
provide any supplemental information requested by any Governmental Entity, including participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its review of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or third party. In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take
all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms

necessary to obtain pre-merger clearance from the U.S. and E.U. antitrust and competition law authorities (specifically, for (1) any waiting period applicable to the Merger under
the HSR Act to have been terminated or expired and (2) the European Commission to have issued a decision finding the Merger to be compatible with the common market under
the Council Regulation, or to have been deemed to have done so pursuant to Article 10(6) of the Council Regulation), provided that in the aggregate any such Permitted
Restrictions would not have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Permitted Restrictions" shall mean (x) Restrictions of the type described in clause (B) or (C) of the definition thereof solely involving the businesses or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, generated no more than $450,000,000 of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 (any such Restrictions described in this clause (x), "Required Divestitures") and (y) Restrictions of the type described in clause (A) or (D) of the definition
thereof which are applied solely against and solely involve and impact the operations, businesses and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, when combined with the impact of any Required Divestitures, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent is not required to agree to or accept any Restriction that involves, applies to or impacts the operations,
businesses or assets of Parent or any of its affiliates other than Permitted Restrictions with respect to the Surviving Corporation and Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation. In
no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted to commit or agree to any Restriction without Parent's prior written consent. Nothing in this Section 5.03(a)
shall require any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations pursuant to this Section 5.03(a) unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any Proceeding brought by or against any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any Consent from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall determine the strategy to be pursued for obtaining and lead the effort to obtain all necessary
actions or nonactions and Consents from Governmental Entities in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Company shall take all reasonable actions to support Parent in connection therewith. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with any filing or submission with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any Consents from any Governmental Entity in connection therewith and any investigation or other inquiry related thereto and in connection with resolving any such
investigation or inquiry with

respect to any such filing or the Merger, (ii) not extend any waiting or suspension period under any applicable Review Laws or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger, including any timing agreements or agreements to pull and re-file their HSR filing, except with the prior written
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (iii) respond as promptly as practicable to any applicable inquiries or
requests received from any Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation, (iv) promptly make any applicable further filings or information
submissions pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable and (v) promptly make any requisite filings or submissions required under any applicable Review Laws.
Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) promptly notify the other party of any written or oral communication to that party or its Subsidiaries or Representatives from
any Governmental Entity regarding the parties' collaborative efforts to obtain the Consents, (B) subject to applicable Law and to the extent reasonably practicable, permit
the other party to review and comment on any written communication regarding such efforts prior to providing such communication to any Governmental Entity and
(C) to the extent reasonably practicable, not agree to participate, or permit its Subsidiaries or Representatives or, in the case of the Company, the Controlled Affiliate, to
participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning Consents to the Merger
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and reasonably practicable, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate. Without limiting the foregoing, neither party shall make any filings, submissions or written communications to any Governmental
Entity to obtain the Consents without first providing a written copy of such filing, submission or communication to the other party (or as appropriate to such party's
outside counsel) and allowing the other party a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on such filing, submission or communication prior to submission. Parent and
the Company covenant and agree to incorporate all reasonable comments of the other party (or as appropriate such party's outside counsel) with respect to such filings,
submissions and communications prior to delivery of the same to any Governmental Entity.

        (c)   (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material, individually or in the aggregate,
operational developments, the general status of relationships with material customers, suppliers and resellers, the general status of ongoing operations and other matters
reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent and in a manner consistent with (A) any organizational or personal conflict of
interest mitigation plans, including firewalls, entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject and
(B) applicable confidentiality obligations, including the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that no such consultation shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

         (ii)  Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of:

        (A)  (1) any representation or warranty made by Company contained in Section 3.01 becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth
in Section 6.02(a) would not be satisfied, (2) the failure of the Company to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by it under this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) would not be satisfied or (3) the occurrence of any change, development, event, effect,

Agreement;

provided, however, that no such notification shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in
this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
provided further, that the failure to deliver any such notification, in and of itself, shall not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the conditions set forth
in Article VI.

        (iii)  Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of:

forth in Section 6.03(a) would not be satisfied or (2) the failure of Parent or Sub to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such

Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that this Section 5.03(d) shall not give Parent
the right to direct such defense.

        SECTION 5.04.    Company Equity-Based Awards.     (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of a
Company Stock Option, except as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below, each then outstanding Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested and exercisable) (i) shall
automatically become fully vested and (ii) shall terminate and be converted automatically into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (A) the product of (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, and (2) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price applicable to such shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, less (B) any applicable
withholding for Taxes (the "Option Merger Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price applicable to shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall terminate and be canceled in exchange for no consideration. As of
the Effective Time, each holder of Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration related
to the applicable Company Stock Option, without interest, payable in accordance with this Section 5.04.

        (b)   Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Restricted Shares,
except as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below, each then outstanding Company Restricted Share (i) shall automatically become fully vested and all restrictions with respect
thereto shall lapse and (ii) shall terminate and be converted automatically into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, less
(B) any applicable withholding for Taxes (the "Restricted Share Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Share Merger Consideration for each Company Restricted Share, without interest,
payable in accordance with this Section 5.04.

        (c)   Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Performance
Shares, except as set forth in Section 5.04(f) below:

          (i)  in the event the Closing occurs prior to the date on which the Company Performance Shares granted in 2015 (the "2015 Company Performance
Shares"), would vest in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, each then outstanding 2015 Company Performance Share (A) shall
automatically become vested based on deemed achievement of performance metrics at the greater of target performance for all applicable metrics or actual
performance for all applicable metrics for the performance period (without pro-ration) and all restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and (B) shall terminate
and be converted automatically into the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (1) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Performance

nearest share), and (y) the Merger Consideration, less (2) any applicable withholding for Taxes (the "2015 Performance Share Merger Consideration"); and

         (ii)  each then outstanding Company Performance Share that was granted in 2016 or 2017 (the "Subsequent Period Company Performance Shares") (A) shall
automatically become vested based on deemed achievement of performance metrics at target performance for all applicable performance metrics with pro-ration
in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan and the award agreements thereunder and (B) shall terminate and be converted automatically into the right
to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (1) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance
Share immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined after taking into account the vesting set forth above), and (y) the Merger Consideration, less (2) any
applicable withholding for Taxes (the "Subsequent Period Performance Share Merger Consideration" and together with the 2015 Performance Share Merger
Consideration, the "Performance Share Merger Consideration"). With respect to each Subsequent Period Company Performance Share that is forfeited due to pro-
ration, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall grant each holder thereof who remains an employee as of the grant date with
an award of Parent restricted stock rights with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock with a value equal to two times the value of such forfeited
Company Performance Shares (for the avoidance of doubt, calculated at target performance multiplied by the Merger Consideration) (the "Parent Retention
Grant"). One-half of the Parent Retention Grant shall vest on March 1, 2019 and the remaining one-half of the Parent Retention Grant shall vest on March 1,
2020, in each case subject to continued employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries as of such dates; provided, however, that holders of Parent Retention Grants
who are involuntarily terminated other than for cause prior to March 1, 2019 shall vest in half of the Parent Retention Grant upon such termination.

        (iii)  As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Performance Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Performance Share Merger Consideration for each Company Performance Share or the Parent Retention Grant, if applicable, without interest, payable in
accordance with this Section 5.04.

        (d)   Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Deferred Stock Units, except as set
forth in Section 5.04(f) below, each then outstanding Company Deferred Stock Unit (i) shall automatically become fully vested and (ii) shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (2) the Merger Consideration, less (B) any applicable withholding for Taxes, payable in accordance with, and subject to, the
deferral elections applicable to such Company Deferred Stock Units as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (e)   Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Phantom Stock Units, each then
outstanding Company Phantom Stock Unit (i) shall automatically become fully vested and (ii) shall represent the right to receive a cash payment equal to (A) the product
of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Phantom Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (2) the Merger
Consideration, less (B) any applicable withholding for Taxes, payable in accordance with, and subject to, the deferral elections applicable to such Company Phantom
Stock Units as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary including the provisions of Sections 5.04(a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement or otherwise, with respect to Permitted
2018 Awards (as defined and permitted by Section 4.01 of the Company Letter), only the 2018 Award Pro Rata Percentage shall become vested at the Effective Time and
shall be entitled to the Option Merger Consideration, the Restricted Share Merger Consideration, the Performance Share Merger Consideration and the consideration set
forth in Section 5.04(d). The remainder of any Permitted 2018 Award shall be forfeited. The 2018 Award Pro Rata Percentage means a fraction, (i) the numerator of
which is the number of days that have elapsed from the grant date of such award (or in the case of Company Performance Shares, from the beginning of the performance
period) through and including the Closing Date and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of days from the grant date of such award (or in the case of
Company Performance Shares, from the beginning of the performance period) through the final regularly scheduled vesting date of such award. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Permitted 2018 Awards that are Company Performance Shares shall be cashed out at deemed target level performance with pro-ration in accordance with the
terms of the first sentence of Section 5.04(c)(ii).

        (g)   As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than 10 days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.04, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, through the
Surviving Corporation's payroll or a third party engaged to provide payroll services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Company Equity-Based Awards
subject to Section 409A of the Code, including the Company Deferred Stock Units and the Company Phantom Stock Units, the payments required under this Section 5.04
shall be made in accordance with the deferral elections applicable to such Company Equity-Based Awards as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
otherwise in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

        (h)   At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or if appropriate, any committee administering the applicable Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Equity-Based Awards
pursuant to this Section 5.04 and (ii) cause the Company Stock Plans (other than the Company ESPP) to terminate at the Effective Time.

        (i)    The Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Company ESPP: (i) participants in the Company ESPP ("ESPP Participants") may not increase their payroll
deductions under the Company ESPP from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) no new ESPP Participants may commence participation in the Company
ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iii) all participation in and purchases under the Company ESPP shall be suspended effective as of the last day of the offering
period that includes the date of this Agreement (the "ESPP Suspension Date"), such that the offering period in effect as of the date of this Agreement will be the final
offering period under the Company ESPP; and (iv) with respect to any offering period under the Company ESPP in effect as of the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall ensure that such offering period ends at the ESPP Suspension Date and that each ESPP Participant's accumulated contributions for such offering period are applied
to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP unless the ESPP Participant has previously withdrawn from
such offering period in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Any cash remaining in the Company ESPP after purchases occurring on the ESPP Suspension
Date shall be refunded to ESPP Participants promptly following the ESPP Suspension Date.

base cash compensation or other base wages provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) target annual incentive opportunities that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the target annual cash incentive opportunity and target annual equity incentive opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, in the case of incentive opportunities granted following the Closing, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries); (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, after taking into account the service crediting provisions of Section 5.05(b) and any
additional service performed following the Closing Date); and (iv) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding, for this purpose, the compensation contemplated by
clauses (i)-(iii) above and retention, change in control, or one-time or special benefits or arrangements) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 5.05(a) is intended to or shall create any right in any employee, consultant or
contractor of the Company to continued employment by or service to Parent, the Company, the Sub, or, in each case, any affiliate or Subsidiary thereof, or limit the ability of
Parent, the Company, the Sub, or, in each case, any affiliate or Subsidiary thereof, to terminate the employment or service of any employee, consultant or contractor of the
Company for any reason.

        (b)   To the extent that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under defined benefit pension plans and plans providing for retiree
medical or other welfare benefits, benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was recognized
under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such recognition
of service (A) shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service, and (B) shall not apply for purposes of any
plan, program or arrangement under which similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service; and (ii) with respect to any
health, dental, vision plan or other welfare plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (any such plan, a "Parent Welfare Plan")
in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent Welfare Plan to be waived with respect to
such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation, exclusion or period would have been waived or satisfied under the Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize and credit any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee
in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

        (c)   Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.05, for the performance year that includes the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable
Subsidiary to, pay such annual cash incentive bonuses following the Closing Date under the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

Plan or (ii) retain the employment or services of any Company Personnel.

        SECTION 5.06.    Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.     (a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes or has been at any
time prior to the date of this Agreement a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or

adversely affect any right thereunder of any such indemnified party, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations.

        (b)   In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

        (c)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy effective for claims asserted for a six-
year period after the Effective Time covering each person covered as of the Effective Time by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
which insurance shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such entire six-year period; provided that the Company shall not pay annual premiums for such
policy in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage (the "Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an aggregate premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Company shall

acquire the most advantageous policy obtainable for an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

        (d)   The rights of each indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such indemnified party may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 5.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are expressly intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties
and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.

        SECTION 5.07.    Financing Cooperation.     (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter until the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) timely negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the facilities contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions set forth therein (or on terms that will not materially delay or
prevent the Closing or make the funding with respect to the Financing less likely to occur), (iii) satisfy or cause to be waived on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
set forth in the Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements that are within its control and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder and (iv) upon the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions, consummate the Financing; provided, that nothing herein shall prevent Parent from replacing all or any portion of the Financing provided for in the
Commitment Letter with one or more commitments from financial institutions to provide an equal or greater amount of debt financing to be made available on or prior to the
Closing Date with conditionality no less favorable to Parent in any material respect than that provided for in the Commitment Letter, and upon any such replacement, the
definition of "Commitment Letter" set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been modified as appropriate to reflect such replacement debt financing and any related
commitment letter.

        (b)   Parent shall not amend, modify or waive, or agree to amend, modify or waive (in any case, whether by action or inaction), any term of the Commitment Letter
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing available on the Closing
Date to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (unless, in the case of this clause (i), such amount is fully replaced with an amount of new financing with conditionality
no less favorable to Parent in any material respect), or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the receipt of
the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (y) make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction
of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to the
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto in any material respect (provided, however, that Parent may, without the consent of the Company,
amend or modify the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (A) in accordance with the "market flex" provisions thereof and (B) to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other titled roles with respect to financial institutions that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of the Financing and developments with respect thereto and shall, upon the
request of the Company, provide to the Company copies of all material definitive documents related to the Financing (subject to customary redactions of fee letters).

deposited with the Paying Agent

and all other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, and such unavailable amount is reasonably required to make the payment to the Paying Agent of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, all other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such event, an
"Original Financing Failure"), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Original Financing Failure and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable, alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and in an amount, when added with cash and marketable securities of Parent and Sub,
at least equal to the Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the "Alternate Financing"), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with
respect to such Alternate Financing (the "New Commitment Letter"), which shall replace the existing Commitment Letter; provided that any such Alternate Financing
shall not obligate the Company prior to the Closing as a surety, guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to any person. Parent shall promptly provide a true and
complete copy of such New Commitment Letter to the Company. In the event a New Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" shall mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to mean the New Commitment Letter and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any
fee or other letter relating to the New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

        (d)   From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (x) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (y) the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, provide to Parent all cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Financing or any alternative financing arrangements entered into to provide
funds for the aggregate Merger Consideration, and all other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (provided that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) participate in a reasonable number of requested meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents
for, and prospective lenders, underwriters and purchasers of, the Financing and the Company's senior management and Representatives), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing, (ii) assist with the preparation of (A) materials for rating agency
presentations and investor presentations, (B) registration statements, prospectuses, offering memoranda and private placement memoranda (including use of reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents of accountants for use of their reports in any of the foregoing), (C) bank information memoranda (including a public-side version
thereof) and (D) similar documents, in each case required or customary in connection with the Financing or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) execute and
deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain) customary certificates, accountant's comfort letters (which shall provide "negative assurance" comfort), consents, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance in each case as reasonably requested by the Financing Sources, (iv) provide customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary representation that such information does not contain a material
misstatement or omission and containing a representation to the Financing Sources that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-

the Financing (including any schedules, annexes or exhibits thereto and any pro forma financial statements and financial projections required to be delivered thereunder
and such other pertinent and customary financial and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall reasonably request in order to market,
syndicate and consummate the Financing), (vii) obtain customary payoff letters and any necessary lien terminations and other instruments of discharge in connection with
the repayment of existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (viii) cooperate with Parent's
Financing Sources' due diligence, to the extent customary or reasonable; provided, however, all non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.07(d) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Company shall only be required
to furnish such information to any prospective lenders or other proposed Financing Sources, underwriters, placement agents, initial purchasers or other third parties that
have agreed to keep such information confidential; and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall require any cooperation to the extent it would (1) require the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any
commitment, financing or other fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing Date; (2) require any officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries to execute or deliver
any document or certificate in connection with the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than customary
documents or certificates solely relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the authorization letter and representation referred to in Section 5.07(d)(iv));
(3) unreasonably or materially interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (4) require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would conflict with or violate any applicable Laws or any provision of the organizational documents of the Company, or that would result in a violation or
breach of, or default under, any Specified Contract in effect as of the date of any such request; or (5) result in any officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries
incurring any personal liability in connection with the Financing. Subject to Parent's indemnification obligations under this Section 5.07, the Company hereby consents to
the customary use of its and its Subsidiaries' trademarks, service marks and logos in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Closing and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument
that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than, in each case, customary documents or certificates solely relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries including the authorization letter and management representation referred to in Section 5.07(d)(iv)). Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company and its affiliates, and their respective pre-Closing Representatives, from and against any liability, obligation or loss suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any information provided in connection therewith (other than arising from information provided by the Company or its

respective Representatives. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the financing contemplated by this Section 5.07, or any other financing, is not a
condition to the Closing, and affirms its obligations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the conditions
contained in Article VI) irrespective and independently of the availability of any such financing.

        SECTION 5.08.    Fees and Expenses.     (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.08 and in Section 5.07, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

        (b)   In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly made (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to the Company or its stockholders
or any person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or, in the case of a termination
by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i), a Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) is otherwise made privately or publicly to the
Company and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(d)(i) and (B) prior to the date that is 12 months after such termination, (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (2) any Takeover Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this Section 5.08(b)(i)(B), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall
have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 50%),
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(g) (provided that if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i)
or 7.01(b)(iii), in each case, at any time at which Parent would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(g), this Agreement
shall be deemed terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(g), as applicable, for purposes of this Section 5.08(b)(ii)) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), then, in each such case, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $275,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of
same-day funds (x) in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(g), within two business days after such termination, (y) in the case of a
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), no later than the time of such termination and (z) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in
Section 5.08(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of the events referred to in clauses (B)(1) and (B)(2) above, in each case to an account designated by Parent.

        (c)   The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.08 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this
Section 5.08 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 5.08,
the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.08 at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

Termination, Amendment and Waiver

party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the terms of such
extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights
nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other

negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all of the parties, and no

include any predecessor entities of such person.

        SECTION 8.05.    Counterparts.     This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties.

        SECTION 8.06.    Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.     This Agreement (a) together with any Exhibit hereto and the Company Letter, constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except
for the Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) except for (i) Sections 7.02, 7.03, and 8.09(b) and 8.10, of which the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources Related Parties are
express third party beneficiaries, and (ii) Section 5.06, is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (and their respective successors and assigns) any

contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such Proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of
the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such person's
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any Proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to

objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware

third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or tort or otherwise against the Financing Sources or the Financing Sources
Related Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or federal court, (ii) all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources or the Financing Sources Related Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement, shall be exclusively governed by, and constructed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, and (iii) the provisions of Section 8.10
relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such Proceedings.

        SECTION 8.10.    Waiver of Jury Trial.     Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Financing. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no Representative
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

        SECTION 8.11.    Enforcement.     The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        SECTION 8.12.    Consents and Approvals.     For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties
hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to do so.

        SECTION 8.13.    Severability.     If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other
provision hereof and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

ANNEX B—OPINION OF CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. 

September 16, 2017

The Board of Directors
Orbital ATK, Inc.
45101 Warp Drive
Dulles, VA 20166

Members of the Board:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock (other than Excluded Shares (defined below)) of Orbital
ATK, Inc. (the "Company") of the Merger Consideration (defined below) to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") proposed to be entered into among Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Parent"), Neptune Merger, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and the Company. As more fully described in the Merger Agreement, (i) Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") and (ii) each
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger, other than (a) any Appraisal Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (b) any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the
Company or owned by Parent or Sub (the shares referred to in clauses (a) and (b), "Excluded Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive $134.50 in cash (the "Merger
Consideration").

In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft dated September 16, 2017 of the Merger Agreement and held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other
representatives and advisors of the Company concerning the business, operations and prospects of the Company. We examined certain publicly available business and financial
information relating to the Company as well as certain financial forecasts and other information and data relating to the Company which were provided to or discussed with us by
the management of the Company. We reviewed the financial terms of the Merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to, among other things: current and historical
market prices and trading volumes of Company Common Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of the Company; and the capitalization and
financial condition of the Company. We considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other transactions which we considered relevant in evaluating
the Merger and analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of other companies whose operations we considered
relevant in evaluating those of the Company. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and
financial, economic and market criteria as we deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our fairness opinion committee.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data
publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any
relevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us. With respect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to the Company provided
to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, we have been advised by the management of the Company that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably

prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company.

We have assumed, with your consent, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term,
condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction
or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the Merger. Representatives of the Company have advised us, and we further have assumed,
that the final terms of the Merger Agreement will not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by us. We have not made or been provided with an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company.
We were not requested to, and we did not, solicit third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of the Company, nor were we requested to consider,
and our opinion does not address, the underlying business decision of the Company to effect the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business
strategies that might exist for the Company or the effect of any other transaction in which the Company might engage. We also express no view as to, and our opinion does not
address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger,
or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information available to us, and financial, stock market and other
conditions and circumstances existing, as of the date hereof.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the proposed Merger and will receive a fee for such services, a significant portion
of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. We also will receive a fee in connection with the delivery of this opinion. We and our affiliates in the past have
provided, and currently provide, services to the Company unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we and such affiliates have received and expect to receive
compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to the date hereof, having acted (i) as joint book-runner for an offering of senior notes by the
Company in September 2015 and (ii) as lender, syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book-runner in connection with a term loan and revolving credit facility for the
Company. We and our affiliates in the past have also provided, and currently provide, services to Parent unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which services we and such
affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to the date hereof, having acted or acting as joint
book-runner for an offering of senior notes by Parent in November 2016. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of
the Company and Parent for our own account or for the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition,
we and our affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates.

Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company in its evaluation of the proposed Merger, and
our opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the
proposed Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described above and other factors we deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as
of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares).

Very truly yours,

CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC.

ANNEX C—SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§ 262. Appraisal rights. 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to
such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
"stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
"depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251
(other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258,
§ 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock
as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and
(g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members
who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of
each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger
or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following
the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and
who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For
purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than
10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)
and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement
described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days
after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall
be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The
Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal
rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as
provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates
upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

Table of Contents

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in
the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or
consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
