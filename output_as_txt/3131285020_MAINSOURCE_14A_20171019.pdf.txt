MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Shareholder:

On July 25, 2017, First Financial Bancorp., or First Financial, and MainSource Financial Group, Inc., or MainSource, entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger agreement”) that provides for the combination of the two companies. Under the merger
agreement, MainSource will merge with and into First Financial, with First Financial as the surviving corporation, in a transaction we refer to as
the “merger.” Following the completion of the merger, MainSource Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of MainSource, will merge with and
into First Financial Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial, with First Financial Bank as the surviving bank, in a transaction we refer
to as the “bank merger.” The merger will combine two Midwest community banks to create a $13 billion institution with scale and strength in
commercial and retail banking, wealth management, and specialty finance.

In the merger, each outstanding share of MainSource common stock (except for certain specified shares of MainSource common stock held by
MainSource or First Financial) will be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock (which we
refer to as the “exchange ratio”). Although the number of shares of First Financial common stock that each MainSource shareholder will receive is
fixed, the market value of the merger consideration will fluctuate with the market price of First Financial common stock and will not be known at
the time MainSource shareholders vote on the merger. Based on the closing price of First Financial’s common stock on The NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC, or NASDAQ, on July 25, 2017, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger, the exchange ratio represented
approximately $38.99 in value for each share of MainSource common stock. Based on First Financial’s closing price on October 16, 2017, of
$26.40, the exchange ratio represented approximately $36.63 in value for each share of MainSource common stock. Based on the exchange ratio
and the number of shares of MainSource common stock outstanding and reserved for issuance under various equity plans and shares that may be
issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options as of October 13, 2017, the maximum number of shares of First Financial common stock
issuable in the merger is 36.5 million. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for First Financial (trading symbol “FFBC”) and
MainSource (trading symbol “MFSG”).

MainSource and First Financial will each hold a special meeting of their shareholders in connection with the merger. MainSource and First
Financial shareholders will be asked to vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve related matters, as described in the attached joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of First
Financial common stock and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of MainSource common stock.

The special meeting of First Financial shareholders will be held on December 4, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. local time. The First Financial special meeting
may be attended in person, at the Taft Centre at Fountain Square, 425 Walnut Street, Second Floor, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, or viewed through a
webcast via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ffbc17SM.

The special meeting of MainSource shareholders will be held on December 4, 2017 at 2105 North State Road 3 Bypass, Greensburg, Indiana
47240, at 2:00 p.m. local time.

MainSource’s board of directors unanimously recommends that MainSource shareholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and
“FOR” the other matters to be considered at the MainSource special meeting.

First Financial’s board of directors unanimously recommends that First Financial shareholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement
and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the First Financial special meeting.

The attached joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the special meeting of First Financial, the special meeting of MainSource, the merger, the
documents related to the merger, and other related matters. Please carefully read the entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 25, for a discussion of the risks relating to the merger. You also can obtain information about First Financial and
MainSource from documents that each has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities to be
issued in the merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offense.

The securities to be issued in the merger are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank or non-bank subsidiary of
either First Financial or MainSource, and they are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental
agency.

The date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is October 18, 2017, and it is first being mailed or otherwise delivered to the shareholders of First
Financial and MainSource on or about October 24, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following are some questions that you may have about the merger and the First Financial special meeting or the
MainSource special meeting, and brief answers to those questions. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be
important to you with respect to the merger, the First Financial special meeting or the MainSource special meeting.
Additional important information is also contained in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Please see “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Q: What is the merger?

A: First Financial and MainSource have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 25, 2017 (which we refer
to as the “merger agreement”). Under the merger agreement, MainSource will be merged with and into First Financial, with
First Financial continuing as the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the “merger”). Following the completion of the
merger, MainSource Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of MainSource, will merge with and into First Financial Bank, a
wholly-owned bank subsidiary of First Financial, with First Financial Bank continuing as the surviving bank (which we refer to
as the “bank merger”). A copy of the merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

   If the merger is completed, MainSource shareholders will receive 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock for each share
of MainSource common stock they hold immediately prior to the merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. As a result of
the foregoing, based on the number of shares of First Financial and MainSource common stock outstanding as of July 25, 2017,
on a fully diluted basis, approximately 63.4% and 36.6% of First Financial common stock will be held by First Financial
shareholders and former holders of MainSource common stock, respectively, immediately following the effectiveness of the
merger.

   The merger cannot be completed unless, among other things, both First Financial shareholders and MainSource shareholders
approve their respective proposals to adopt the merger agreement.

Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?

A: We are delivering this document to you because it is a joint proxy statement being used by both the First Financial and
MainSource boards of directors to solicit proxies of their respective shareholders in connection with approval of the merger and
related matters.

   In order to approve the merger and related matters, First Financial has called a special meeting of its shareholders. This
document serves as the proxy statement for the First Financial special meeting and describes the proposals to be presented at
the First Financial special meeting.

   MainSource has also called a special meeting of its shareholders to approve the merger and related matters. This document
serves as the proxy statement for the MainSource special meeting and describes the proposals to be presented at the
MainSource special meeting.

   Finally, this document is also a prospectus that is being delivered to MainSource shareholders because, in connection with the
merger, First Financial is offering shares of its common stock to MainSource shareholders in a 1.3875:1 exchange ratio.

   This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger and the other proposals being voted on
at the First Financial and MainSource special meetings and important information to consider in connection with an investment
in First Financial common stock. You should read it carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your
shares of common stock voted by proxy without attending your meeting. Your vote is important and we encourage you to
submit your proxy as soon as possible.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What are First Financial shareholders being asked to vote on at the First Financial special meeting?

A: First Financial is soliciting proxies from its shareholders with respect to the following proposals:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, as such agreement may be amended from time to time (which we refer to as the
“First Financial merger proposal”); and

• a proposal to adjourn the First Financial special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor
of the First Financial merger proposal (which we refer to as the “First Financial adjournment proposal”).

Q: What are MainSource shareholders being asked to vote on at the MainSource special meeting?

A: MainSource is soliciting proxies from its shareholders with respect to the following proposals:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, as such agreement may be amended from time to time (which we refer to as the
“MainSource merger proposal”);

• a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
MainSource’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to
which such compensation may be paid or become payable (which we refer to as the “MainSource compensation
proposal”); and

• a proposal to adjourn the MainSource special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of
the MainSource merger proposal (which we refer to as the “MainSource adjournment proposal”).

Q: What will MainSource shareholders receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, MainSource shareholders will receive 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock for each share
of MainSource common stock held immediately prior to the merger. First Financial will not issue any fractional shares of First
Financial common stock in the merger. First Financial will pay to each former MainSource shareholder who holds fractional
shares an amount in cash determined by multiplying the average of the closing sale prices of First Financial common stock for
the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the closing date of the merger (which we refer to
as the “First Financial share closing price”) by the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of First Financial common stock that such shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive. We refer to the
shares of First Financial common stock and the cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be received in the merger for each share
of MainSource common stock as the “merger consideration.”

Q: What will First Financial shareholders receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, First Financial shareholders will not receive any merger consideration and will continue to hold the
shares of First Financial common stock that they currently hold. Following the merger, shares of First Financial common stock
will continue to be traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market® (which we refer to as “NASDAQ”) under the
symbol “FFBC.”

Q: How will the merger affect MainSource equity awards?

A: The MainSource equity awards will be affected as follows:

   Options: At the effective time of the merger, each option granted by MainSource to purchase shares of MainSource common
stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, shall without any
further action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by First Financial and converted into an option to purchase from
First Financial common shares on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such MainSource options, a number
of shares of First Financial common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of MainSource common stock subject to such MainSource common stock option immediately prior to the
effective time by (y) the exchange ratio, at a per share exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per share exercise price for each share of MainSource common stock subject to such
MainSource stock option by (ii) the exchange ratio.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

   Restricted Stock: Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted share of MainSource
common stock will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition deemed satisfied to the extent provided in the
applicable award agreement) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration,
less applicable tax withholdings.

   Performance Share Units: Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding performance share unit
award in respect of MainSource common stock will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to
such performance share unit deemed satisfied at target) and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the merger consideration in respect of each share of MainSource common stock underlying such performance share
unit, less applicable tax withholdings.

Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
time the merger is completed?

A: Yes. Although the merger consideration is fixed, the value of the merger consideration will fluctuate between the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the merger based upon the market value for First Financial common
stock. Any fluctuation in the market price of First Financial common stock after the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus will change the value of the shares of First Financial common stock that MainSource shareholders will
receive.

Q: How does the First Financial board of directors recommend that I vote at the First Financial special meeting?

A: First Financial’s board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the First Financial merger proposal, and
“FOR” the First Financial adjournment proposal.

Q: How does the MainSource board of directors recommend that I vote at the MainSource special meeting?

A: MainSource’s board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the MainSource merger proposal, “FOR” the
MainSource compensation proposal, and “FOR” the MainSource adjournment proposal.

A: After you have carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and have decided how you wish to vote your shares, please
vote your shares promptly so that your shares are represented and voted at the First Financial special meeting and/or the
MainSource special meeting, as applicable. If you are a shareholder of both First Financial and MainSource, you will need to
vote your First Financial and MainSource shares separately and to submit a separate proxy card to each company. If you hold
your shares in your name as a shareholder of record, you must complete, sign, date, and mail your proxy card in the enclosed
postage-paid return envelope as soon as possible. Alternatively, you may vote through the Internet or by telephone. Information
and applicable deadlines for voting through the Internet or by telephone are set forth in the enclosed proxy card instructions. If
you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank or broker, you must direct your bank or broker how to vote in accordance
with the instructions you have received from your bank or broker. “Street name” shareholders who wish to vote in person at the
First Financial special meeting or MainSource special meeting will need to obtain a legal proxy from the institution that holds
their shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Why is my vote important?

A: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for First Financial or MainSource to obtain the necessary quorum to hold their
special meetings. In addition, your failure to submit a proxy or vote in person, or failure to instruct your bank or broker how to
vote, or abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: If my shares of common stock are held in “street name” by my bank or broker, will my bank or broker automatically
vote my shares for me?

A: No. Your bank or broker cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. If your shares are held in “street name”
through a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to
vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in “street
name” by returning a proxy card directly to First Financial or MainSource, or by voting in person at the First Financial special
meeting or the MainSource special meeting, unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker,
bank, or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks, or other nominees who hold shares of First Financial common stock or
MainSource common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to First Financial or MainSource to vote those
shares with respect to any of the proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks, and other
nominees do not have discretionary voting power on these matters. Failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: How do I vote if I own shares through the First Financial 401(k) Savings Plan?

A: If you participate in the First Financial 401(k) Savings Plan (the “First Financial Savings Plan”) and common shares have been
allocated to your account in the First Financial Savings Plan, you are entitled to instruct the trustee of the First Financial
Savings Plan, confidentially, as to how to vote those common shares pursuant to the instructions provided to plan participants.
The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your duly executed instructions received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 30, 2017. If you do not send instructions, your instructions are not timely received, or your instructions are not
properly completed, the shares credited to your account in the First Financial Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee in the
same proportion that it votes shares in the First Financial Savings Plan for which it did receive timely instructions. You may
also revoke previously given voting instructions by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 30, 2017 by filing with the trustee
either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed instruction bearing a later date.

Q: How do I vote if I own shares through the MainSource 401(k) Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan?

A: If you participate in the MainSource Financial Group, Inc. 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “MainSource
Plan”) and common shares have been allocated to your account in the MainSource Plan, you are entitled to instruct First
Bankers Trust Services, Inc., the trustee of the MainSource Plan, confidentially, as to how to vote those common shares
pursuant to the instructions provided to plan participants. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your duly
executed instructions received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 30, 2017. If you do not send instructions, your
instructions are not timely received, or your instructions are not properly completed, the shares credited to your account in the
MainSource Plan will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion that it votes shares in the MainSource Plan for which it did
receive timely instructions. You may also revoke previously given voting instructions by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 30, 2017 by filing with the trustee either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed
instruction bearing a later date.

Q: Can I attend the First Financial and MainSource special meetings and vote my shares in person?

A: Yes. All holders of the common stock of First Financial and MainSource, including shareholders of record and shareholders
who hold their shares through banks, brokers, nominees, or any other holder of record, are invited to attend their respective
special meetings. Holders of record of First Financial and MainSource common stock can vote in person at the First Financial
special meeting and MainSource special meeting, respectively. If you are not a shareholder of record (i.e., if your shares are
held for you in “street name”),

nominee, to be able to vote in person at the meetings. If you only hold common stock in your capacity as a participant in the

holder, or have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of

to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership or without proper photo identification. Whether or not
you intend to be present at the First Financial special meeting or the MainSource special meeting, you are urged to sign, date,
and return your proxy card, or to vote via the Internet or by telephone, promptly. If you are then present and wish to vote your
shares in person, your original proxy may be revoked by voting at the special meeting.

shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of First Financial common stock upon the completion of the
merger will instead receive, for the fraction of a share, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) based on the First
Financial per share closing price.

As a result of the foregoing, based on the number of shares of First Financial and MainSource common stock outstanding as of
July 25, 2017, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 63.4% and 36.6% of First Financial common stock will be held by First
Financial shareholders and former MainSource shareholders, respectively, immediately following the effectiveness of the merger.

First Financial common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “FFBC,” and MainSource common stock is listed on
NASDAQ under the symbol “MSFG.” The following table shows the closing sale prices of First Financial common stock and
MainSource common stock as reported on NASDAQ on July 25, 2017, the last full trading day before the public announcement
of the merger agreement, and on October 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This table also shows the implied value of the merger consideration payable for each share of MainSource
common stock, which was calculated by multiplying the closing price of First Financial common stock on those dates by the
exchange ratio of 1.3875.

At the July 25, 2017 meeting at which the First Financial board of directors considered and approved the merger agreement,
Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (which we refer to as “Sandler O’Neill”) delivered to the board of directors its oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of such date, and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations described in Sandler O’Neill’s opinion, the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger was fair to First Financial from a financial point of view.

The full text of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion
outlines the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion.

First Financial shareholders are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with their consideration of the
proposed merger.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was directed to First Financial’s board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the merger and is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the exchange ratio to First Financial. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any First
Financial shareholder as to how such First Financial shareholder should vote at any meeting of shareholders called to
consider and vote upon the First Financial merger proposal. It does not address the underlying business decision of First
Financial to engage in the merger, the form or structure of the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to
any other alternative business strategies that might exist for First Financial, or the effect of any other transaction in which
First Financial might engage.

connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion did not address the underlying business
decision of MainSource to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the

Financial, and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage by the surviving corporation for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the merger.

The First Financial board of directors was aware of and considered those interests, among other matters, in reaching its decisions
to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and to recommend the adoption of the merger
agreement to First Financial shareholders. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of First Financial’s Directors and

under change in control agreements entered into with certain officers, continued employment for certain executive officers of
MainSource, and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage by the surviving corporation for acts or omissions

incorporated, the holders of MainSource common stock will not be entitled to any dissenters’ rights in connection with the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Neither MainSource nor First Financial can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that
the merger will be completed. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Complete the Merger”
beginning on page 99.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 99)

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time by First Financial or MainSource prior to the effective time of the merger
under the following circumstances:

• by mutual written consent;

• if any governmental entity issues a final and nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• by either party, if the merger is not consummated by October 31, 2018, unless the failure of the merger to be
consummated by that date is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or
observe its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement; and

• subject to cure rights, if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements, or any inaccuracy of any
of the representations or warranties of the other party, such that the conditions to the terminating party’s obligations to
complete the merger would not be satisfied.

In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated:

• by MainSource if, prior to obtaining the approval of the First Financial shareholders of the First Financial merger
proposal, the First Financial board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change or breaches its obligations
with respect to calling a meeting of its shareholders or recommending that its shareholders adopt the merger agreement;
or

• by First Financial if, prior to obtaining the approval of the MainSource shareholders of the MainSource merger
proposal, the MainSource board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change or breaches its obligations with
respect to the non-solicitation of acquisition proposals, calling a meeting of its shareholders, or recommending that its
shareholders adopt the merger agreement; or

• by MainSource, in the event that (i) the volume-weighted average price of shares of First Financial common stock
quoted on NASDAQ for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the Determination Date (as defined below) (the
“First Financial Average Closing Price”) is less than $22.18 per share, and (ii) the First Financial Average Closing Price
for such period underperforms the KBW Regional Banking Index by greater than 20%. If MainSource exercises its
termination right described in the preceding sentence, First Financial will have the option to keep the merger agreement
in full force and effect by increasing the exchange ratio to adjust for such decrease in market value. The merger
agreement defines “Determination Date” as the latest of (i) the date on which all regulatory approvals (and waivers, if
applicable) necessary for consummation of the merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period); or (ii) the
date on which the shareholder approvals of both MainSource and First Financial have been received.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 99.

Termination Fee (page 101)

If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving alternative acquisition
proposals and changes in the recommendation of MainSource’s board of directors, MainSource may be required to pay to First
Financial a termination fee equal to $40 million. This termination fee could discourage other companies from seeking to acquire
or merge with MainSource. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” beginning on page 101.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

The following table shows selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information about the financial condition
and results of operations of First Financial giving effect to the merger with MainSource. The selected unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information assumes that the merger is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting,
with First Financial treated as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of MainSource, as
of the effective date of the merger, will be recorded by First Financial at their respective estimated fair values, and the excess of the
merger consideration over the fair value of MainSource’s net assets will be allocated to goodwill.

The pro forma financial condition data set forth in the table below assumes that the transactions became effective on June 30, 2017.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and June
30, 2017 present the pro forma results of operations of First Financial giving effect to the merger as if it became effective on January
1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet information as of June 30, 2017 gives effect to the merger as if
it occurred on June 30, 2017, and combines the historical balance sheets of First Financial and MainSource as of June 30, 2017. The
selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the notes thereto, which is included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.”

The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of
the period presented. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not consider any
potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues, potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and expense
efficiencies, or asset dispositions, among other factors. Further, as explained in more detail in the notes accompanying the more
detailed unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information,” the pro forma allocation of the purchase price reflected in the selected unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will
be recorded at the time the merger is completed. Additionally, the adjustments made in the unaudited pro forma condensed financial
information, which are described in the notes thereto, are preliminary and may be revised.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Some of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are forward looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 giving First Financial’s or MainSource’s
expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are typically
identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” “positions,” “projections,”
“prospects,” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may,” or by variations of
such words or by similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits
of the merger or the bank merger, including future financial and operating results of First Financial, MainSource, or the combined
company following the merger, the combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions, the expected timing of the
completion of the merger, financing plans and the availability of capital, the likelihood of success and impact of litigation, and other
statements that are not historical facts. These statements are only predictions based on First Financial’s and MainSource’s current
expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause First Financial’s and MainSource’s
actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance, or
achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In particular, you should consider the numerous risks and
uncertainties described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 25.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties which change over time. In addition
to factors previously disclosed in First Financial’s and MainSource’s reports filed with the SEC, the following factors, among
others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements:

• the inability to close the merger and the bank merger in a timely manner;

• the failure to complete the merger due to the failure of First Financial or MainSource shareholders to approve the First
Financial or MainSource merger proposals;

• failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals and meet other closing conditions to the merger on the expected terms
and schedule;

• the potential impact of announcement or consummation of the proposed merger with MainSource on relationships with
third parties, including customers, employees, and competitors;

• business disruption following the merger;

• difficulties and delays in integrating the First Financial and MainSource businesses or fully realizing cost savings and
other benefits;

• First Financial’s potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of MainSource;

• the impact of the combined company exceeding $10 billion in assets;

• the challenges of integrating, retaining, and hiring key personnel;

• failure to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the manner anticipated;

• the outcome of pending or threatened litigation, or of matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or
commencing in the future, including litigation related to the merger;

• any interruption or breach of security resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger,
deposit, loan, or other systems;

• changes in First Financial’s stock price before closing, including as a result of the financial performance of MainSource
prior to closing;

• operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes
in information technology systems, on which First Financial and MainSource are highly dependent;

financial accounting and reporting, environmental protection, and insurance, and the ability to comply with such changes
in a timely manner;

• changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board;

For any forward-looking statements made in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or in any documents incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, First Financial and MainSource claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-
looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the applicable document
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Except to the extent required by applicable law, First Financial
and MainSource do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions, or events that
occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. All written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the

RISK FACTORS

In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the section “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding how to vote for the proposals presented in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other
documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see “Where You Can Find More
Information.”

Risks Related to the Merger and First Financial’s Business Upon Completion of the Merger

Because the market price of First Financial common stock will fluctuate, MainSource shareholders cannot be certain of the
market value of the merger consideration they will receive.

Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of MainSource common stock (except for shares of MainSource common
stock owned by MainSource as treasury stock or owned by MainSource or First Financial or a subsidiary of either (in each case
other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted)) will be converted into 1.3875 shares of
First Financial common stock. The market value of the merger consideration will vary from the closing price of First Financial
common stock on the date First Financial and MainSource announced the merger, on the date that this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is mailed to MainSource shareholders, on the date of the special meeting of the MainSource shareholders, and
on the date the merger is completed. Any change in the market price of First Financial common stock prior to the completion of the
merger will affect the market value of the merger consideration that MainSource shareholders will receive upon completion of the
merger, and there will be no adjustment to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of either shares of First
Financial common stock or shares of MainSource common stock.

The market price of First Financial’s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the
market regarding First Financial’s operations or business prospects, including market sentiment regarding First Financial’s entry into
the merger agreement. These risks may be affected by:

• operating results that vary from the expectations of First Financial’s management or of securities analysts and investors;

• developments in First Financial’s business or in the financial services sector generally;

• regulatory or legislative changes affecting First Financial’s industry generally or its business and operations;

• operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to First Financial;

• changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies;

• announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings, and other material events by First
Financial or its competitors; and

• changes in global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange
rates, stock, commodity, credit, or asset valuations or volatility.

Therefore, at the time of the MainSource special meeting, you will not know the precise market value of the consideration you will
receive at the effective time of the merger. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of First Financial common stock
and for shares of MainSource common stock.

The market price of First Financial common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the
shares of MainSource or First Financial currently.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of MainSource common stock will become holders of First Financial common stock. First
Financial’s business differs in important respects from that of MainSource, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the
combined company and the market price of First Financial common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by
factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of First Financial and MainSource. For
a discussion of the businesses of First Financial and MainSource and of some important factors to consider in connection with those
businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under “Where You
Can Find More Information.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently
anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.

Before the merger and the bank merger may be completed, First Financial and MainSource must obtain approvals from the Federal
Reserve Board and the ODFI. Other approvals, waivers, or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether
to grant these approvals, the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party and the factors
described under “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger.” An adverse development in either party’s
regulatory standing or these factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may
impose conditions on the completion of the merger or the bank merger or require changes to the terms of the merger or the bank
merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or the bank merger or
imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger and the bank merger, any of
which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger. See “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals
Required for the Merger.”

In a recent approval order, the Federal Reserve Board has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a
banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity, the Federal Reserve Board will not in the future allow the
application to remain pending while the banking organization addresses its weaknesses. The Federal Reserve Board explained that,
in the future, if issues arise during the processing of an application, it will require the applicant banking organization to withdraw its
application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns. Accordingly, if there is an adverse development in either party’s
regulatory standing, First Financial may be required to withdraw some or all of the applications for approval of the proposed
mergers and, if possible, resubmit it after the applicable supervisory concerns have been resolved. See “The Merger—Regulatory
Approvals Required for the Merger.”

The success of the merger and integration of First Financial and MainSource will depend on a number of uncertain factors.

The success of the merger will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation:

• First Financial’s ability to integrate the branches acquired from MainSource Bank in the merger (which we refer to as the
“acquired branches”) into First Financial Bank’s current operations;

• First Financial’s ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by its new customers in the acquired branches and to
successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired in the merger;

• First Financial’s ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired branches in a manner that
enables it to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;

• First Financial’s ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired branches; and

• First Financial’s ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the
acquired branches.

Integrating the acquired branches will be an operation of substantial size and expense and may be affected by general market and
economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial industry generally. Integration efforts will also likely divert First
Financial’s management’s attention and resources. No assurance can be given that First Financial will be able to integrate the
acquired branches successfully, and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing
business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect First Financial’s ability to maintain
relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. First Financial
may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect its earnings and financial
condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of the acquired branches will not adversely
affect First Financial’s existing profitability, that First Financial will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved
by its existing banking business, or that First Financial will be able to manage any growth resulting from the merger effectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Combining First Financial and MainSource may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected and the anticipated
benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized.

First Financial and MainSource have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The
success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on First Financial’s ability to
successfully combine and integrate the businesses of First Financial and MainSource in a manner that permits growth opportunities
and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is
possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company’s ongoing
businesses, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to
maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees, or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of
the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect First Financial’s ability to successfully conduct its business, which
could have an adverse effect on First Financial’s financial results and the value of its common stock. If First Financial experiences
difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer
to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause First
Financial and/or MainSource to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from First Financial and/or MainSource
and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert
management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of MainSource and First
Financial during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined company. In
addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated.

The combined company may be unable to retain First Financial and/or MainSource personnel successfully after the merger is
completed.

The success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key
employees currently employed by First Financial and MainSource. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with
First Financial or MainSource, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with the combined company after the merger is
consummated. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain
effective operations, the combined company’s business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be
diverted from successfully integrating MainSource to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company’s
business to suffer. In addition, First Financial and MainSource may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key
employees who leave either company, or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document are preliminary and the actual
financial condition and results of operations of First Financial after the merger may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this document are presented for illustrative purposes only and
are not necessarily indicative of what First Financial’s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the
merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect
adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the MainSource identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary,
and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities
of MainSource as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ
materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more information, please see “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 105.

Certain of MainSource’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from the interests of
MainSource’s shareholders.

MainSource’s shareholders should be aware that some of MainSource’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of MainSource’s shareholders generally. MainSource’s board
of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making its decision to approve
the merger agreement, and in recommending that MainSource’s shareholders vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement.

If the merger agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, MainSource’s or First Financial’s
businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management
on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is
terminated, the market price of MainSource’s or First Financial’s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market
prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances, MainSource may be required to pay to First Financial a termination fee of $40 million.

MainSource and First Financial will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is
pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on MainSource or First
Financial. These uncertainties may impair MainSource’s or First Financial’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel
until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with MainSource or First Financial to seek to change
existing business relationships with MainSource or First Financial. Retention of certain employees by MainSource or First Financial
may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the
combined company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, or a desire
not to remain with MainSource or First Financial, MainSource’s business or First Financial’s business could be harmed. In addition,
subject to certain exceptions, each of First Financial and MainSource has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior
to closing. See “The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements” for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to
MainSource and First Financial.

If the merger is not completed, First Financial and MainSource will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the
expected benefits of the merger.

Each of First Financial and MainSource has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and
completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing, and
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the merger. If the
merger is not completed, First Financial and MainSource would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected
benefits of the merger.

The merger agreement limits MainSource’s ability to pursue acquisition proposals and requires MainSource to pay a termination fee
to First Financial of $40 million under limited circumstances, including circumstances relating to acquisition proposals.
Additionally, certain provisions of the First Financial and MainSource amended and restated articles of incorporation, amended and
restated regulations, and amended and restated bylaws (referenced throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus as “articles of
incorporation,” “regulations,” and “bylaws”) may deter potential acquirers.

The merger agreement prohibits MainSource from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging, or knowingly facilitating certain
third-party acquisition proposals. See “The Merger Agreement—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers.” The merger agreement
also provides that MainSource will be required to pay a termination fee in the amount of $40 million in the event that the merger
agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including a change of recommendation by MainSource’s board of directors.
See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee.” These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have
an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of MainSource from considering or proposing such an acquisition. Certain provisions
of the MainSource or First Financial articles of incorporation, regulations, or bylaws, or of the IBCL or OGCL, as applicable, could
make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of MainSource or First Financial and may discourage a potential
competing acquirer.

The shares of First Financial common stock to be received by MainSource shareholders as a result of the merger will have
different rights from the shares of MainSource common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, MainSource shareholders will become First Financial shareholders and their rights as shareholders
will be governed by the OGCL and the First Financial articles of incorporation and regulations. The rights associated with
MainSource common stock are different from the rights associated with

TABLE OF CONTENTS

First Financial common stock. Please see “Comparison of Rights of First Financial Shareholders and MainSource Shareholders”
beginning on page 119 for a discussion of the different rights associated with First Financial common stock.

Holders of MainSource and First Financial common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined
company after the merger and will exercise less influence over management.

Holders of MainSource and First Financial common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors
and on other matters affecting MainSource and First Financial, respectively. Upon completion of the merger, each MainSource
shareholder who receives shares of First Financial common stock will become a shareholder of First Financial, with a percentage
ownership of First Financial that is smaller than the shareholder’s percentage ownership of MainSource. Based on the number of
shares outstanding on July 25, 2017 and the shares expected to be issued in the merger, the former shareholders of MainSource as a
group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 36.6% of the outstanding shares of First Financial common stock
immediately after the merger. As a result, current shareholders of First Financial as a group will own approximately 63.4% of the
outstanding shares of First Financial common stock immediately after the merger. Because of this, MainSource shareholders may
have less influence on the management and policies of First Financial than they now have on the management and policies of
MainSource, and current First Financial shareholders may have less influence than they now have on the management and policies
of First Financial.

MainSource shareholders will not have dissenters’ rights in the merger.

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial
proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to shareholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the
IBCL, a shareholder may not dissent from a merger as to shares that are listed on a national securities exchange at the record date
fixed to determine the shareholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of shareholders to vote upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation.

Because MainSource common stock is listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so
listed on the record date, and because the merger otherwise satisfies the foregoing requirements of the IBCL, holders of MainSource
common stock will not be entitled to dissenters’ rights in the merger with respect to their shares of MainSource common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, First Financial will exceed $10 billion in assets, and as a result, it will become subject to
increased regulatory requirements, which could materially and adversely affect it.

Upon completion of the merger, First Financial’s bank subsidiary’s total assets will exceed $10 billion, and First Financial and its
bank subsidiary will therefore become subject to increased regulatory requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing
regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including
compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve Board’s enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing
requirements. Failure to meet the enhanced prudential standards and stress testing requirements could limit, among other things,
First Financial’s ability to engage in expansionary activities or make dividend payments to its shareholders. In addition, banks with
$10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to
various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Currently, First Financial’s bank subsidiary is subject to
regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the Federal Reserve Board is primarily responsible for examining First Financial’s bank
subsidiary’s compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and those CFPB regulations. As a relatively new agency
with evolving regulations and practices, there is uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s examination and regulatory authority might
impact First Financial’s business.

With respect to deposit-taking activities, banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to two changes. First, these
institutions are subject to a deposit assessment based on a new scorecard issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”). This scorecard considers, among other things, the bank’s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and
funding-related stress, as well as First Financial’s use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the bank’s
performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 2.5 to 45 basis points. Any increase in First Financial’s
bank subsidiary’s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to its use of deposits as a funding source.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Additionally, banks with over $10 billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve Board’s
rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. This means that, beginning on July 1 following the bank’s crossing the $10
billion threshold at the end of a calendar year, First Financial’s bank subsidiary will be limited to receiving only a “reasonable”
interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued to its customers. The Federal Reserve
Board has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus 5
basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. A
reduction in the amount of interchange fees First Financial’s bank subsidiary receives for electronic debit interchange will reduce its
revenues. During fiscal year 2016, First Financial’s bank subsidiary collected $13.7 million in debit card interchange fees. First
Financial estimates that had it been subject to this limitation during 2016 its interchange fee revenue would have been reduced by
approximately $6.2 million.

In anticipation of becoming subject to the heightened regulatory requirements, First Financial has begun to reorganize its
compliance and risk personnel and implement various initiatives to address these requirements. However, compliance with these
requirements may necessitate that it hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal
controls, and/or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition, or results of operations. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed,
may also be misinterpreted by the market generally or First Financial’s customers and, as a result, may adversely affect First
Financial’s stock price or ability to retain customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities. To ensure compliance
with these heightened requirements when effective, First Financial’s regulators may require it to take actions to prepare for
compliance even before First Financial or First Financial’s bank subsidiary’s total assets equal or exceed $10 billion at the end of
four consecutive quarters. As a result, First Financial has incurred and expects to continue to incur compliance-related costs before
it is otherwise required. First Financial’s regulators may also consider its preparation for compliance with these regulatory
requirements when examining its operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval it may make, even
requests for approvals on unrelated matters.

Risks Related to First Financial’s Business

You should read and consider risk factors specific to First Financial’s business that will also affect the combined company after the
merger. These risks are described in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in First Financial’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in other documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

This section contains information for First Financial shareholders about the special meeting that First Financial has called to allow
its shareholders to consider and vote on the merger agreement and other related matters. First Financial is mailing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to you, as a First Financial shareholder, on or about October 24, 2017. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is
accompanied by a notice of the special meeting of First Financial shareholders and a form of proxy card that First Financial’s board
of directors is soliciting for use at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Date, Time, and Place of Meeting

The special meeting of First Financial shareholders will be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on December 4, 2017. First Financial
shareholders will be able to attend the First Financial special meeting in person at the Taft Centre at Fountain Square, 425 Walnut

proxy card. Instructions on how to view the special meeting via the webcast are posted at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ffbc17SM. First Financial shareholders will not be able to vote or revoke a proxy while
viewing the First Financial special meeting virtually. While First Financial’s management will address questions from shareholders
physically present or who have submitted their questions electronically prior to the special meeting, the webcast will not allow First
Financial shareholders to ask questions of management during the meeting. First Financial shareholders may visit
www.proxyvote.com at any time prior to the special meeting to ask questions of First Financial’s executive management that may be
addressed in the special meeting. On or about October 24, 2017, First Financial commenced mailing this document and the enclosed
form of proxy card to its shareholders entitled to vote at the First Financial special meeting.

Matters to Be Considered

At the First Financial special meeting, First Financial shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:

• the First Financial merger proposal; and

• the First Financial adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of First Financial’s Board of Directors

The First Financial board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the First Financial merger proposal and “FOR” the First
Financial adjournment proposal. See “The Merger—First Financial’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of First Financial’s
Board of Directors” for a more detailed discussion of the First Financial board of directors’ recommendation.

First Financial Record Date and Quorum

The First Financial board of directors has fixed the close of business on October 13, 2017, as the record date for determining the
holders of First Financial common stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the First Financial special meeting.

As of the First Financial record date, there were 62,068,758 shares of First Financial common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
at the First Financial special meeting held by 2,332 holders of record. Each share of First Financial common stock entitles the holder
of record as of the First Financial record date to one vote at the First Financial special meeting on each proposal to be considered at
the First Financial special meeting.

A quorum must exist before business can be conducted at the special meeting. Under First Financial’s regulations, a quorum will
exist if a majority of the common shares outstanding as of the record date are present in person or by proxy. All shares of First
Financial common stock, whether present in person or represented by proxy, including abstentions, will be treated as present for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the First Financial special meeting.

Vote Required; Treatment of Abstentions and Failure to Vote

First Financial merger proposal:

Standard: Approval of the First Financial merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of First Financial common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, or fail to instruct your bank or
broker with respect to the First Financial merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

First Financial adjournment proposal:

Standard: Approval of the First Financial adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the votes present and entitled to vote at the First Financial special meeting.

Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the First Financial adjournment proposal. However, if you fail to submit a proxy card or vote in person at the First
Financial special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the First Financial adjournment
proposal, it will have no effect on the proposal.

Shares Held by Officers and Directors

As of the First Financial record date, the directors and executive officers of First Financial beneficially owned, and were entitled to
vote, 1,049,553 shares of First Financial common stock, representing approximately 1.69% of the shares of First Financial common
stock outstanding on that date. As of the First Financial record date, excluding shares held in fiduciary or agency capacity,
MainSource and its subsidiaries did not own any shares of First Financial common stock.

Each of First Financial’s directors, solely in his or her capacity as a First Financial shareholder, has entered into a voting agreement
with MainSource, pursuant to which each such director has agreed to vote in favor of the First Financial merger proposal.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

A First Financial shareholder may vote by proxy or in person at the First Financial special meeting. If you hold your shares of First
Financial common stock in your name as a shareholder of record, to submit a proxy, you, as a First Financial shareholder, may use
one of the following methods:

• By telephone: by calling the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card and following the recorded instructions.

• Through the Internet: by visiting the website indicated on your proxy card and following the instructions.

• Complete and return the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in the
United States.

First Financial requests that First Financial shareholders vote by telephone, over the Internet, or by completing and signing the
accompanying proxy card and returning it to First Financial as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

Every First Financial shareholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each First Financial shareholder should sign, date, and return the
enclosed proxy card, or vote via the Internet or by telephone, whether or not the First Financial shareholder plans to attend the First
Financial special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy card or voting by telephone or on the Internet will not prevent you from
voting your shares personally at the meeting, since you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

All shares represented by valid proxies that First Financial receives through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, will be voted
in accordance with your instructions on the proxy card. If you make no specification on your proxy card as to how you want your
shares voted before signing and returning it, your proxy will be voted “FOR” the First Financial merger proposal and “FOR” the
First Financial adjournment proposal. No matters other than the matters described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are
anticipated to be presented for action at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.
However, if other business properly comes before the special meeting, your proxy will be voted as directed by a majority of the First
Financial board of directors.

Shares Held in “Street Name”; Broker Non-Votes

If you are a First Financial shareholder and your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other holder of record,
you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in “street name” by
returning a proxy card directly to First Financial or by voting in person at the First Financial special meeting unless you provide a
“legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank, or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks, or other nominees who
hold shares of First Financial common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to First Financial to vote those
shares with respect to any of the proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks, and other nominees
do not have discretionary voting power on the proposals that will be voted upon at the First Financial special meeting.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a First Financial Shareholder’s Vote

You have the power to change your vote at any time before your shares of First Financial common stock are voted at the First
Financial special meeting by:

• signing and returning a proxy card with a later date;

• voting by telephone or the Internet at a later time;

• delivering a written revocation letter to First Financial’s corporate secretary; or

• attending the First Financial special meeting in person, notifying the corporate secretary of your revocation of your proxy,
and voting by ballot at the First Financial special meeting.

Shareholders attending the First Financial special meeting virtually will not be able to revoke their proxy through the webcast.
Physical attendance at the special meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy. A revocation or later-dated proxy received by
First Financial after the vote will not affect the vote. First Financial’s corporate secretary’s mailing address is: Attn: Shannon M.
Kuhl, Corporate Secretary, First Financial Bancorp., 255 East 5th Street, Suite 2900, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202.

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be
received before the beginning of the First Financial special meeting. If you have instructed a bank, broker, or other nominee to vote
your shares of First Financial common stock, you must follow the directions you receive from your bank, broker, or other nominee
in order to change or revoke your vote.

Participants in the First Financial 401(k) Savings Plan

If you participate in the First Financial Savings Plan and common shares have been allocated to your account in the First Financial
Savings Plan, you are entitled to instruct the trustee of the First Financial Savings Plan, confidentially, as to how to vote those
common shares pursuant to the instructions provided to plan participants. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your
duly executed instructions received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 30, 2017. If you do not send instructions, your
instructions are not timely received, or your instructions are not properly completed, the shares credited to your account in the First
Financial Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion that it votes shares in the First Financial Savings Plan for
which it did receive timely instructions. You may also revoke previously given voting instructions by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 30, 2017 by filing with the trustee either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed instruction
bearing a later date.

Solicitation of Proxies

First Financial is soliciting your proxy in conjunction with the merger. First Financial will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies
from you. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, First Financial will request that banks, brokers, and other record holders
send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of First Financial common stock and secure their voting instructions. First
Financial will reimburse the record holders for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions. If necessary, First Financial may
use its directors and several of its regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from the First
Financial shareholders, either personally or by telephone, facsimile, letter, or electronic means. First Financial has also made
arrangements with Advantage Proxy to assist it in soliciting proxies and has agreed to pay Advantage Proxy approximately $6,750,
plus the reimbursement of certain expenses, for these services.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Attending the First Financial Special Meeting in Person

All holders of First Financial common stock, including holders of record and shareholders who hold their shares through banks,
brokers, nominees or any other holder of record, are invited to attend the First Financial special meeting. Shareholders of record can
vote in person at the First Financial special meeting. If you are not a shareholder of record, you must obtain a proxy executed in
your favor from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank, or other nominee, to be able to vote in person at the First
Financial special meeting. If you plan to attend the First Financial special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or
have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo
identification with you in order to be admitted. First Financial reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof
of share ownership and without proper photo identification. The use of cameras, sound recording equipment, communications
devices, or any similar equipment during the First Financial special meeting is prohibited without First Financial’s express written
consent.

Attending the First Financial Special Meeting Virtually

All holders of the common stock of First Financial may view the First Financial special meeting virtually through a webcast.
Holders of the common stock of First Financial may view the webcast of the meeting via the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ffbc17SM when you enter your 16-digit control number included with the proxy card.
Instructions on how to view the First Financial special meeting via the webcast are posted at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ffbc17SM. You will not be able to vote your First Financial shares or revoke your proxy while
attending the First Financial special meeting virtually. While First Financial management will address questions from shareholders
physically present or who have submitted their questions electronically prior to the meeting, the webcast will not allow shareholders
to ask questions of management during the meeting. Holders of the common stock of First Financial may visit www.proxyvote.com
at any time prior to the First Financial special meeting to ask questions of our executive management that may be addressed in the
meeting.

Delivery of Proxy Materials to Shareholders Sharing an Address

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies to mail a single proxy statement to two or more shareholders sharing the same
address. This practice is known as “householding.” Householding provides greater convenience to shareholders and saves First
Financial money by reducing excess printing costs. You may have been identified as living at the same address as another First
Financial shareholder. If this is the case, and unless First Financial receives contrary instructions from you, First Financial will
continue to “household” your proxy statement for the reasons stated above.

On written or oral request to Investor Relations, 255 East 5th Street, Suite 2900, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202,or toll free at (877) 322-
9530, or First Financial’s proxy solicitor, Advantage Proxy, at P.O. Box 13581, Des Moines, WA 98198, or toll-free at (877) 870-
8565, First Financial will deliver promptly a separate copy of this document to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single
copy of the document was delivered.

FIRST FINANCIAL PROPOSALS

PROPOSAL NO. 1: FIRST FINANCIAL MERGER PROPOSAL

First Financial is asking its shareholders to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the merger, the bank merger, and the issuance of common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement. Holders
of First Financial common stock should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the
annexes, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

After careful consideration, the First Financial board of directors, by a unanimous vote of all directors, approved the merger
agreement and declared the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the bank merger, and
the issuance of common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, to be advisable and in the best interests of First
Financial and the shareholders of First Financial. See “The Merger— First Financial’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of
First Financial’s Board of Directors” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of
the First Financial board of directors’ recommendation.

The First Financial board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the First Financial merger proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 2: FIRST FINANCIAL ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

The First Financial special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among other
things, further solicitation of proxies if necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the First Financial merger proposal.

If, at the First Financial special meeting, the number of shares of First Financial common stock present or represented and voting in
favor of the First Financial merger proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal, First Financial intends to move to adjourn the
First Financial special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement. In this proposal, First
Financial is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the First Financial board of directors on a
discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the First Financial special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from First Financial shareholders who have previously voted.

The First Financial board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the First Financial adjournment proposal.

THE MAINSOURCE SPECIAL MEETING

This section contains information for MainSource shareholders about the special meeting that MainSource has called to allow its
shareholders to consider and vote on the merger agreement and other related matters. MainSource is mailing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to you, as a MainSource shareholder, on or about October 24, 2017. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is
accompanied by a notice of the special meeting of MainSource shareholders and a form of proxy card that MainSource’s board of
directors is soliciting for use at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Date, Time, and Place of Meeting

The special meeting of MainSource shareholders will be held on December 4, 2017 at 2105 North State Road 3 Bypass, Greensburg,
Indiana 47240, at 2:00 p.m. local time. On or about October 24, 2017, MainSource commenced mailing this document and the
enclosed form of proxy card to its shareholders entitled to vote at the MainSource special meeting.

Matters to Be Considered

At the special meeting of shareholders, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:

• the MainSource merger proposal;

• the MainSource compensation proposal; and

• the MainSource adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of MainSource’s Board of Directors

MainSource’s board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of MainSource and its
shareholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement. MainSource’s board of directors unanimously recommends that
MainSource shareholders vote “FOR” the MainSource merger proposal, “FOR” the MainSource compensation proposal, and “FOR”
the MainSource adjournment proposal. See “The Merger—MainSource’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of
MainSource’s Board of Directors” for a more detailed discussion of the MainSource board of directors’ recommendation.

MainSource Record Date and Quorum

MainSource’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on October 13, 2017 as the record date for determining the holders
of MainSource common stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the MainSource special meeting.

As of the MainSource record date, there were 25,582,413 shares of MainSource common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at
the MainSource special meeting held by approximately 2,842 holders of record. Each share of MainSource common stock entitles
the holder to one vote at the MainSource special meeting on each proposal to be considered at the MainSource special meeting.

The presence at the MainSource special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
MainSource common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. All shares
of MainSource common stock present in person or represented by proxy, including abstentions, will be treated as present for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the MainSource special meeting.

Vote Required; Treatment of Abstentions and Failure to Vote

MainSource merger proposal:

Standard: Approval of the MainSource merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of MainSource common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.

Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, or fail to instruct your bank or
broker with respect to the MainSource merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MainSource compensation proposal:

Standard: Approval of the MainSource compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the votes present and entitled to vote at the MainSource special meeting.

Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the MainSource compensation proposal. However, if you fail to submit a proxy card or vote in person at the
MainSource special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the MainSource compensation
proposal, it will have no effect on the proposal.

MainSource adjournment proposal:

Standard: Approval of the MainSource adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
votes present and entitled to vote at the MainSource special meeting.

Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the MainSource adjournment proposal. However, if you fail to submit a proxy card or vote in person at the
MainSource special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the MainSource adjournment
proposal, you will not be deemed to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have no effect on the proposal.

Shares Held by Officers and Directors

As of the MainSource record date, the directors and executive officers of MainSource beneficially owned and were entitled to vote
approximately 950,974 shares of MainSource common stock, representing approximately 3.7% of the shares of MainSource
common stock outstanding on that date. As of the MainSource record date, excluding shares held in fiduciary or agency capacity,
First Financial and its subsidiaries did not own any shares of MainSource common stock.

Each of MainSource’s directors, solely in his or her capacity as a MainSource shareholder, has entered into a voting agreement with
First Financial, pursuant to which each such director has agreed to vote in favor of the MainSource merger proposal.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

A MainSource shareholder may vote by proxy or in person at the MainSource special meeting. If you hold your shares of
MainSource common stock in your name as a shareholder of record, you, as a MainSource shareholder, may use one of the
following methods:

• By telephone: by calling the number indicated on your proxy card and following the recorded instructions.

• Through the Internet: by visiting the website indicated on your proxy card and following the instructions.

• Complete and return the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in the
United States.

MainSource requests that MainSource shareholders vote by telephone, over the Internet, or by completing and signing the
accompanying proxy card and returning it to MainSource as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

Every MainSource shareholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each MainSource shareholder should sign, date, and return the
enclosed proxy card, or vote via the Internet or by telephone, whether or not the MainSource shareholder plans to attend the
MainSource special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy card or voting by telephone or on the Internet will not prevent you
from voting your shares personally at the meeting, since you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

All shares represented by valid proxies that MainSource receives through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, will be voted in
accordance with your instructions on the proxy card. If you make no specification on your proxy card as to how you want your
shares voted before signing and returning it, your proxy will be voted “FOR” the MainSource merger proposal, “FOR” the
MainSource compensation proposal, and “FOR” the MainSource adjournment proposal. No matters other than the matters described
in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus are anticipated to be presented for action at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the
special meeting. However, if other business properly comes before the special meeting, your proxy will be voted as directed by a
majority of the MainSource board of directors.

Shares Held in “Street Name”; Broker Non-Votes

If you are a MainSource shareholder and your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you
must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions
provided by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in “street name” by returning a proxy card directly to MainSource or
by voting in person at the MainSource special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker,
bank, or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks, or other nominees who hold shares of MainSource common stock on behalf of their
customers may not give a proxy to MainSource to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals without specific
instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks, and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on the proposals
that will be voted upon at the MainSource special meeting.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a MainSource Shareholder’s Vote

You have the power to change your vote at any time before your shares of MainSource common stock are voted at the MainSource
special meeting by:

• signing and returning a proxy card with a later date;

• voting by telephone or the Internet at a later time;

• delivering a written revocation letter to MainSource’s Corporate Secretary; or

• attending the MainSource special meeting in person, notifying the corporate secretary of your revocation of your proxy,
and voting by ballot at the MainSource special meeting.

Attendance at the special meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy. A revocation or later-dated proxy received by
MainSource after the vote will not affect the vote. MainSource’s corporate secretary’s mailing address is: Corporate Secretary,
MainSource Financial Group, 2105 North State Road 3 Bypass, Greensburg, Indiana 47240.

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be
received before the beginning of the MainSource special meeting. If you have instructed a bank, broker, or other nominee to vote
your shares of MainSource common stock, you must follow the directions you receive from your bank, broker, or other nominee in
order to change or revoke your vote.

Participants in the MainSource 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan

If you participate in the MainSource Plan and common shares have been allocated to your account in the MainSource Plan, you are
entitled to instruct First Bankers Trust Services, Inc., the trustee of the MainSource Plan, confidentially, as to how to vote those
common shares pursuant to the instructions provided to plan participants. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your
duly executed instructions received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 30, 2017. If you do not send instructions, your
instructions are not timely received, or your instructions are not properly completed, the shares credited to your account in the
MainSource Plan will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion that it votes shares in the MainSource Plan for which it did
receive timely instructions. You may also revoke previously given voting instructions by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 30,
2017 by filing with the trustee either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed instruction bearing a later
date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Solicitation of Proxies

MainSource is soliciting your proxy in conjunction with the merger. MainSource will bear the cost of soliciting proxies from you. In
addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, MainSource will request that banks, brokers, and other record holders send proxies and
proxy material to the beneficial owners of MainSource common stock and secure their voting instructions. MainSource will
reimburse the record holders for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions. If necessary, MainSource may use its directors
and several of its regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from the MainSource shareholders,
either personally or by telephone, facsimile, letter, or electronic means. MainSource may also contract with a proxy solicitor to
solicit proxies if it determines such services are necessary.

Attending the MainSource Special Meeting

All holders of MainSource common stock, including holders of record and shareholders who hold their shares through banks,
brokers, nominees, or any other holder of record, are invited to attend the MainSource special meeting. Shareholders of record can
vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a shareholder of record, you must obtain a proxy executed in your favor from
the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank, or other nominee, to be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you
plan to attend the MainSource special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder
of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to
be admitted. MainSource reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership and without
proper photo identification. The use of cameras, sound recording equipment, communications devices, or any similar equipment
during the MainSource special meeting is prohibited without MainSource’s express written consent.

Delivery of Proxy Materials to Shareholders Sharing an Address

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies to mail a single proxy statement to two or more shareholders sharing the same
address. This practice is known as “householding.” Householding provides greater convenience to shareholders and saves
MainSource money by reducing excess printing costs. You may have been identified as living at the same address as another
MainSource shareholder. If this is the case, and unless MainSource receives contrary instructions from you, MainSource will
continue to “household” your proxy statement for the reasons stated above.

On written or oral request to Investor Relations at 2105 North State Road 3 Bypass, Greensburg, Indiana 47240, or at (812) 663-
6734, MainSource will deliver promptly a separate copy of this document to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single
copy of the document was delivered.

Assistance

If you have any questions concerning the merger or this joint proxy statement/prospectus, would like additional copies of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, or need help voting your shares of MainSource common stock, please contact Investor Relations, 2105
North State Road 3 Bypass, Greensburg, Indiana 47240, or at (812) 663-6734.

MAINSOURCE PROPOSALS

PROPOSAL NO. 1: MAINSOURCE MERGER PROPOSAL

MainSource is asking its shareholders to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby. Holders of
MainSource common stock should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes, for
more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

After careful consideration, the MainSource board of directors, by a unanimous vote of all directors, determined that the merger, on
the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, is in the best interests of MainSource and its shareholders. Please see
“The Merger—MainSource’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of MainSource’s Board of Directors” included elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the MainSource board of directors’ recommendation.

The MainSource board of directors unanimously recommends that MainSource shareholders vote “FOR” the MainSource merger
proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 2: MAINSOURCE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
MainSource is seeking non-binding, advisory approval from its shareholders of the compensation of MainSource’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed in “The Merger—Interests of MainSource Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” and “The Merger—Merger-Related Compensation for MainSource’s Named Executive Officers”
beginning on pages 80 and 84, respectively. The proposal gives MainSource’s shareholders the opportunity to express their views on
the merger-related compensation of MainSource’s named executive officers. Accordingly, MainSource is requesting its shareholders
to adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to MainSource’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in
each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—Interests of MainSource Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” and “The Merger —Merger-Related Compensation for MainSource’s Named Executive Officers,” are
hereby APPROVED.”

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is advisory only
and will not be binding on First Financial or MainSource. If the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid
to MainSource’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and
arrangements even if MainSource shareholders fail to approve the advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation.

The MainSource board of directors unanimously recommends that MainSource shareholders vote “FOR” the MainSource
compensation proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 3: MAINSOURCE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

The MainSource special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among other
things, further solicitation of proxies if necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the MainSource merger proposal.

If, at the MainSource special meeting, the number of shares of MainSource common stock present or represented and voting in
favor of the MainSource merger proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal, MainSource intends to move to adjourn the
MainSource special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger agreement. In accordance with the
MainSource bylaws, a vote to approve the proposal to adjourn the MainSource special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the MainSource special meeting to approve the MainSource merger
proposal may be taken in the absence of a quorum.

In this proposal, MainSource is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the MainSource board of
directors on a discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the MainSource special meeting to another time and place for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from MainSource shareholders who have previously
voted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER

The following discussion contains certain information about the merger. The discussion is subject, and qualified in its entirety by
reference, to the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by
reference. We urge you to read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement attached as
Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the merger.

Terms of the Merger

Each of First Financial’s and MainSource’s respective boards of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The
merger agreement provides for the merger of MainSource with and into First Financial, with First Financial continuing as the
surviving corporation. Following the completion of the merger, MainSource Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of MainSource,
will merge with and into First Financial Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of First Financial. First Financial Bank will be the
surviving bank in the bank merger.

In the merger, each share of MainSource common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger,
except for shares of MainSource common stock owned by MainSource as treasury stock or owned by MainSource or First Financial
or a subsidiary of either (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted), will
be converted into the right to receive 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock, without par value. No fractional shares of First
Financial common stock will be issued in connection with the merger.

In January, 2009, MainSource issued a warrant to the United States Department of Treasury to purchase 571,906 shares of
MainSource common stock at an initial per-share exercise price of $14.95. The warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise
price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions, including in
the event MainSource’s quarterly dividend exceeds $0.145/share. The warrant, which was subsequently sold under auction by
Treasury in a private transaction, has a term of ten years and is currently exercisable for 573,256 shares of common stock. As such,
if no further adjustments to the warrant occur prior to the consummation of the merger, the warrant will represent the right to
purchase 795,393 shares of First Financial, which represents the number of shares of First Financial that would be issuable in
exchange for 573,256 MainSource shares after giving effect to the exchange ratio.

MainSource shareholders and First Financial shareholders are being asked to adopt the merger agreement. See “The Merger
Agreement” for additional and more detailed information regarding the legal documents that govern the merger, including
information about conditions to the completion of the merger and provisions for terminating or amending the merger agreement.

Background of the Merger

In connection with the ongoing consideration and evaluation of long-term strategic alternatives and prospects, MainSource’s board
of directors and executive management have considered and regularly reviewed the strategic direction and business objectives of the
organization as part of their continuous efforts to enhance value to shareholders and other constituencies. For the past several years
this strategic planning exercise included an annual strategic planning retreat in which the board and management evaluated the
merits and drawbacks of (i) continuing to operate as an independent institution, (ii) continued expansion through de novo branch
expansion or the strategic acquisition of other institutions and branch offices, and (iii) entering into a strategic merger with another
financial institution. On several occasions the board and management invited representatives of investment banks, including Keefe,
Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW”), to participate in its strategic planning meetings to provide additional perspective and market
information regarding potential acquisition targets and potential acquirors. Management and the board also considered various
anticipated opportunities and challenges facing MainSource as it sought to achieve its strategic goals.

Additionally, from time to time during the past several years, MainSource’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Archie Brown,
met socially with chief executive officers from other financial institutions in MainSource’s footprint to discuss the banking market
in general and each institution’s goals and objectives. Mr. Brown also used these meetings to gauge other institutions’ appetite for
strategic transactions in the short or long term. These meetings were generally informal and often occurred over lunch, but also took
place informally or formally at investor or banking industry conferences.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

One of the most significant challenges facing MainSource during the past several years has been the predominantly rural nature of
its franchise. Specifically, MainSource’s branches have historically been located in small, non-metropolitan markets. These markets
were characterized by slower growth and presented few opportunities for economies through consolidation. Beginning in 2009,
MainSource’s board of directors established a strategic goal of growing through acquisitions and de novo branching with an
emphasis on entering into higher growth markets within its footprint, including the metropolitan markets of Cincinnati, Indianapolis,
and Louisville. Since then MainSource has implemented this growth strategy, during which time it has:

• opened de novo branches in Indianapolis (2), Columbus (3), Seymour and Bloomington, Indiana, Cincinnati, Ohio, and
Louisville, Kentucky;

• consummated 3 whole-bank acquisitions, including MBT Bancorp in Cincinnati, Ohio; Cheviot Financial Corp. in
Cincinnati, Ohio; and FCB Bancorp in Louisville, Kentucky; and

• made 9 branch purchases since 2009, including branches in Hope, Greensburg, Richmond, Batesville, Brownstown, and
Portland, Indiana; Lawrenceburg and Shelbyville, Kentucky; and Union City, Ohio.

On December 4-5, 2016, the MainSource board of directors and management engaged in their annual strategic planning retreat in
Indianapolis, Indiana. Representatives of KBW were invited to join portions of the retreat to discuss the state of banking and
potential merger and acquisition opportunities. Mr. Brown and MainSource’s Chief Financial Officer, James M. Anderson, also led a
discussion of the board and management regarding strategic alternatives that might be available to the company, including
remaining independent, continuing to grow through acquisitions and de novo branching, engaging in a strategic merger, or being
acquired. During this discussion, the board expressed confidence in the MainSource management team, its history of and ability to
implement MainSource’s strategic plan and the company’s general economic outlook, while acknowledging the challenges facing
MainSource in the future in the achievement of its strategic goals. The board further expressed its disinterest in engaging in a
transaction which would result in MainSource accepting another company’s stock without MainSource management having a role in
the management of the combined company.

On February 28, 2017, Mr. Brown met with First Financial’s Chief Executive Officer, Claude E. Davis, over lunch as they had done
once or twice per year in previous years. Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis discussed the state of the banking industry, strategic issues and
challenges for community banks in general, the cultures and business models of MainSource and First Financial, and related topics,
such as MainSource’s recent acquisitions and First Financial’s preparations to cross $10 billion in total assets, a threshold for
increased regulatory oversight and related compliance costs as well as certain limitations on revenues. During this meeting, it
became clear to each of Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis that they had complementary views and strategies on many of these topics, and
they concluded that it would be prudent to begin to evaluate whether a potential business combination made sense for the
companies. No specific terms of a business combination were discussed and no confidential information was exchanged.

On March 13, 2017, Mr. Brown met with the executive committee of the MainSource board of directors to relay the substance of his
February 28, 2017 conversations with Mr. Davis. The Executive Committee requested that Mr. Brown continue to meet with Mr.
Davis to gather more information regarding First Financial.

On March 16, 2017, Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis met again to discuss the culture and business strategy of their respective companies
and to evaluate whether continued discussions regarding a business combination between First Financial and MainSource would
make sense. In order to facilitate a candid discussion, Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis exchanged a letter agreement providing for the
confidentiality of any information exchanged during the preliminary discussions. The discussion focused on the general rationale for
a business combination and potential operational synergies between the companies. Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis also discussed
potential board and management organizational models for a combined company, which included a blend of First Financial and
MainSource board members and management, and First Financial’s merger and acquisition structure guidelines. No specific terms
of a business combination were discussed, but Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis agreed to speak again soon and to include in their
discussion certain key members of their executive management teams for the purpose of determining what specific information
might be shared in order to help each company properly consider a potential business combination.

On March 27, 2017, MainSource held its regularly-scheduled meeting of the board of directors. During the executive session of the
board of directors, Mr. Brown informed the board members of his meetings with

Mr. Davis and the matters that had been discussed. The board discussed their previously stated goal of remaining independent based
on their confidence in management and management’s ability to successfully implement the company’s strategy. Based on the
preliminary discussions between Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis, the board of directors discussed the need to obtain additional
information regarding First Financial in order that a full evaluation of a potential combination could occur.

On March 31, 2017, Mr. Brown, Mr. Davis, the Chief Financial Officers of each of First Financial and MainSource, and the
President, Chief Banking Officer of First Financial held a conference call for purposes of discussing various items to be shared
between the parties in order that each party could assess the financial impact of a business combination, including potential expense
savings and one-time costs.

On April 11, 2017, MainSource and First Financial entered into a Mutual Confidentiality Agreement.

In April 2017, two follow-up meetings and a conference call were conducted for the purpose of discussing financial information
about the respective companies, how the companies might fit together including potential executive management and board
structures, how fulsome due diligence might be conducted, and the status of discussions between such executives and their
respective boards of directors, each of which had been informed by Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis, respectively, of the discussions. The
first of such meetings occurred on April 11 among Mr. Brown, Mr. Davis, and key members of their executive management teams.
The second such meeting occurred on April 18 between Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis. During the April 18 meeting, Mr. Davis
presented Mr. Brown with a pricing approach for a proposed transaction which included certain pricing principles and assumptions
as well as a preliminary indicative range of exchange ratios for a transaction whereby MainSource shareholders might receive 1.35 -
1.40 shares of First Financial common stock for every share of MainSource common stock they held. On April 26, 2017, Mr. Brown
and Mr. Davis participated in a teleconference to discuss the First Financial board of directors’ agreement to continue discussions
with MainSource.

On May 3, 2017, during MainSource’s regularly-scheduled meeting of the board of directors, Mr. Brown reviewed all of the
previous discussions between MainSource and First Financial, as well as the preliminary financial information shared by the parties.
The board discussed the benefits and challenges of remaining independent versus engaging in a strategic merger; the strategic
rationale for such a merger; an overview of First Financial, including its financial highlights, market presence, lines of business, and
leadership; a preliminary pro forma financial analysis of the combined entity; the impact of such a merger on MainSource’s
constituents, including shareholders, customers, employees, and communities; and the discussions between Mr. Davis and Mr.
Brown regarding board structure and leadership of the surviving institution. Mr. Brown also reviewed certain similar transactions
with other potential strategic partners, as well as the financial ability of each potential strategic partner to enter into such a
transaction. MainSource’s legal counsel discussed with the board of directors its fiduciary duties under Indiana law, including the
board’s duties of care, loyalty and good faith. The board discussed the need for additional information in order that the board could
make an informed decision regarding MainSource’s strategy and direction. The board requested that Mr. Brown outline a “Phase 1”
diligence process for the board’s consideration prior to engaging in further discussions.

On May 11, 2017, the MainSource board of directors held a special meeting to review an outline of the proposed “Phase 1”
diligence process. Mr. Brown reviewed the goals of Phase 1, which included a detailed analysis of various strategic alternatives;
analysis of various organizational issues such as the effect of a combination on the employees and community of Greensburg,
Indiana; preliminary financial, credit, regulatory, and legal diligence; and the establishment of a transaction outline which would
include the presentation by First Financial of a term sheet at the conclusion of Phase 1. Mr. Brown also reviewed the goals of Phase
2, should the board agree following Phase 1 to continue discussions. The board discussed the potential scope and outcomes of Phase
1, as well as the various questions that would be answered. Following discussion, the board authorized Mr. Brown to proceed to
Phase 1.

In mid-May 2017, First Financial and MainSource began conducting formal due diligence with regard to the potential combination.
Throughout May 2017, certain key executives of First Financial and MainSource held meetings to further discuss operational
synergies and cultural fit of First Financial and MainSource. Each party also received a formal report on the results of due diligence
conducted to date by its respective legal advisors.

On May 22, 2017, Mr. Davis and Mr. Brown met to discuss the organizational structure of a combined company, including the
creation of an executive chair role, the division of responsibilities between the executive chair and

the Chief Executive Officer, the remaining executive roles, the size of a combined board and the representation of each party on that
board. Mr. Davis and Mr. Brown discussed the process and timing by which decisions regarding a proposed organizational structure
could be made.

Also on May 22, 2017, MainSource and First Financial amended the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated April 11, 2017, to
expand the definition of Confidential Information in order to allow the parties to share certain customer-related information.

On June 1, 2017, Mr. Davis and Mr. Brown had dinner with certain members of MainSource’s board of directors and certain
members of First Financial’s board of directors. General information regarding First Financial and MainSource was presented along
with Mr. Davis and Mr. Brown’s views of the synergies and value created through a strategic merger of the companies.

On June 5, 2017, the First Financial board of directors held a special meeting to consider a potential combination with MainSource
and the terms of a non-binding term sheet to be submitted to MainSource. First Financial’s legal counsel discussed with the board its
fiduciary duties under Ohio law, including the board’s duties of care, loyalty and good faith. First Financial’s management team
outlined the results of due diligence conducted to date and its thoughts with respect to how a combination with MainSource could
advance First Financial’s business plan, including by providing scale and access to key markets and by providing enhanced retail
banking capabilities and management depth. First Financial’s financial advisor, Sandler O’Neill, also provided an initial analysis of
the strategic and financial implications of a potential business combination, as contemplated by the draft, non-binding term sheet
provided to the board.

On June 5, 2017, First Financial submitted a non-binding term sheet to MainSource. First Financial proposed a fixed exchange ratio
of between 1.375 and 1.425 shares of First Financial common stock for each outstanding share of MainSource common stock,
which, based on the then-current trading price of First Financial, would have a value of between $34.86 and $36.12 per share of
MainSource common stock. First Financial’s term sheet indicated that, following the merger, the board of directors of First
Financial would consist of nine current members of the First Financial board of directors and six current members of the
MainSource board of directors. The term sheet also proposed alternative management structures, one of which included Mr. Davis
as Executive Chairman following the merger with Mr. Brown assuming the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the
merged entity. In addition, the term sheet contemplated retention of a significant number of MainSource employees, and a
commitment to invest in the community of Greensburg, Indiana. The term sheet also proposed to complete due diligence and
negotiate and sign a definitive transaction agreement by mid-July.

On that same date, MainSource’s board of directors held a special meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, to review the results of Phase 1
and the term sheet presented by First Financial. MainSource’s management and representatives of KBW, acting as MainSource’s
financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction, attended portions of the meeting at the board’s request. During the
meeting, the board and management reviewed, with the assistance of KBW:

• the proposed structure of the transaction, including the financial terms proposed by First Financial;

• the pro forma financial impact of the proposed combination terms on the resulting company;

• the strategic rationale for the merger of MainSource and First Financial;

• the potential impact of the transaction on key constituencies, including employees, communities, shareholders, and
customers;

• the various strategic alternatives that might be available to MainSource, including remaining independent, continued
acquisitions, or merger, with a review of the positive and negative attributes and effects of each alternative;

• the financial performance, financial condition, and market performance of First Financial, including then current trading
multiples, historic P/E multiples and publicly available research analysts’ estimates of earnings per share and dividend
growth;

• additional potential merger partners and the financial ability and capacity of each to pay in a similar transaction;

• selected bank merger and acquisition transactions, including “strategic” transactions, transformational transactions, and
transactions of similar sized institutions; and

• additional information regarding First Financial, including its strategy and vision, structure, lines of business, long-term
performance, financial highlights, leadership, financial performance, valuation, and financial comparison to peers.

The MainSource board also reviewed various additional proposed transaction terms, the proposed structure of the board of directors
and senior management, the effect of the transaction on Decatur County, Indiana, including certain commitments that First Financial
had made to keeping employees in and financially supporting the Greensburg, Indiana community, and the results of Phase 1
diligence. Additionally, the board and management reviewed certain strategic benefits of considering a business combination,
including the additional resources needed to stay competitive in technology and the creation of a larger platform with which to grow
shareholder value. The board reviewed each term of the proposed term sheet. At the conclusion of the meeting, the board voted to
approve Mr. Brown’s execution of the term sheet with certain revisions, including downside protection in the event First Financial’s
stock price dropped in excess of a market decline, a more definitive commitment to the Greensburg, Indiana community, and
inclusion of the management structure naming Mr. Brown as President and Chief Executive Officer of the merged entity.

During the days following the June 5, 2017 MainSource board meeting, management of First Financial and MainSource negotiated
the terms of the non-binding term sheet. On June 7, 2017, MainSource executed and delivered the term sheet.

In the first half of June 2017, certain key executives of First Financial and MainSource held additional meetings to further discuss
operational matters related to the potential combination of their respective companies, including the need to create a combined
management structure and team that would enable the combined company to: (i) leverage the best attributes of each of First
Financial and MainSource across a larger business and footprint; and (ii) successfully address the enhanced regulatory obligations
resulting from crossing the $10 billion asset threshold. Certain of these meetings also included other members of the executive
management teams of First Financial or MainSource. Also during June, each of First Financial and MainSource conducted
supplemental due diligence on each other. On June 23, 2017, Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP (which we refer to as “Squire Patton
Boggs”), on behalf of First Financial, sent to SmithAmundsen LLC, on behalf of MainSource, a draft merger agreement for the
proposed transaction, and the parties subsequently discussed and negotiated such draft agreement.

On June 26, 2017, Mr. Davis attended the executive session of MainSource’s regularly-scheduled meeting of the board of directors.
Mr. Davis and the MainSource board of directors discussed the advantages and benefits of a merger, including the synergies he saw
between MainSource and First Financial.

On June 27, 2017, the MainSource and First Financial credit teams met to discuss and compare commercial credit strategy and
credit administration practices of the two companies. Mr. Brown, Mr. Davis, Mr. Anderson, and Mr. Gavigan also met to discuss the
merger agreement. That evening, Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis had dinner with the members of the First Financial board of directors.

In early July, Mr. Brown, Mr. Davis, and certain members of their executive management teams continued to discuss financial
information, the business of each company, and the potential organizational structure and management of a combined company. On
July 12, 2017, the Compensation Committee of First Financial’s board of directors conducted a meeting with First Financial’s Chief
Talent Officer, its compensation consultant, and its legal counsel to evaluate potential management and compensation and benefits
structures for the combined company and a process to prepare to make recommendations to the full board of First Financial. As part
of this meeting, First Financial’s legal counsel discussed fiduciary duties with the Compensation Committee, following up on a
presentation made to First Financial’s entire board of directors in June. Likewise, First Financial’s Chief Talent Officer and
compensation consultant advised the Compensation Committee on matters of organizational design and compensation. Members of
the Compensation Committee discussed these issues at length and asked questions of all of First Financial’s Chief Talent Officer,
compensation consultant, and legal counsel.

Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis continued to discuss transaction terms, including financial terms and management structure and
compensation. On July 18, 2017, representatives of First Financial further discussed the terms of the proposed business combination
with representatives of MainSource. During such discussion, First Financial

and MainSource verbally agreed, subject to board approval, to a fixed exchange ratio of 1.3875 which, based on the then-current
trading price of First Financial’s common stock, would provide consideration with a value of $38.23 per share of MainSource
common stock. First Financial and MainSource subsequently confirmed that they each had completed due diligence and were
interested in finalizing and announcing a definitive transaction on the terms discussed.

On July 19, 2017, the MainSource board of directors held a special meeting for purposes of: reviewing a draft of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, a copy of which had been provided to the board; reviewing financial aspects of the transaction with KBW;
reviewing merger-related employee benefit matters which would be considered more fully by the Executive Compensation
Committee at a meeting on July 25, 2017; and reviewing the timeline and communication plan for the signing and announcement of
the merger. During the meeting, MainSource’s legal counsel reviewed the merger agreement with the board and the board engaged
in a discussion regarding each material term of the draft agreement, which contemplated, among other things, that: (i) MainSource
would merge with and into First Financial with First Financial surviving the merger, (ii) following the merger, MainSource Bank
would merge with and into First Financial Bank, (iii) the exchange ratio would be 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock for
each outstanding share of MainSource common stock, (iv) First Financial would set the number of directors at 15 and appoint six
MainSource directors to the First Financial board of directors and the First Financial Bank board of directors, (v) the proposed
employment agreements for Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis, and (vi) following the merger, certain executive officers of MainSource
would continue as executive officers of First Financial. The board asked numerous questions regarding the proposed merger terms
and terms of similar transactions.

Also at this meeting, KBW discussed with the MainSource board of directors financial aspects of the proposed transaction,
including, among other things, a comparison of transaction multiples as of June 2, 2017 and July 17, 2017, a comparison of the
proposed transaction to selected bank merger and acquisition transactions announced since January 1, 2016 and certain potential pro
forma effects of the transaction on First Financial, and discussed on a preliminary basis the fairness opinion to be delivered by KBW
with respect to the exchange ratio in the proposed merger. Mr. Anderson and KBW also discussed with the MainSource board of
directors the cost savings and one-time costs that could result from the merger. With the assistance of KBW, the MainSource board
of directors again considered other potential merger partners for MainSource and the apparent financial ability and capacity of each
to pay in a similar transaction. The MainSource board also considered the value of a strategic merger with First Financial, including
the financial strength and market presence of the combined company.

On July 24, First Financial’s Compensation Committee conducted a follow-up meeting, again including First Financial’s Chief
Talent Officer, compensation consultant, and legal counsel, and adopted a resolution recommending to the full board of directors a
post-merger organizational structure involving a position of Executive Chairman, to be occupied by Mr. Davis, and a Chief
Executive Officer position, to be occupied by Mr. Brown, as well as employment agreements for each of Mr. Davis and Mr. Brown.

On July 25, 2017, the First Financial board of directors met to consider approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill and Squire Patton Boggs attended
this meeting. At the meeting, the First Financial board of directors reviewed a copy of the current draft of the merger agreement
which contemplated, among other things, that: (i) MainSource would merge with and into First Financial with First Financial
surviving the merger, (ii) following the merger, MainSource Bank would merge with and into First Financial Bank, (iii) the fixed
exchange ratio would be 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock for each outstanding share of MainSource common stock,
(iv) First Financial would set the number of directors at 15 and appoint six MainSource directors to the First Financial board of
directors and the First Financial Bank board of directors, (v) the proposed employment agreements for Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis,
and (vi) following the merger, certain executive officers of MainSource would continue as executive officers of First Financial. At
the special meeting, First Financial’s legal counsel reviewed with members of the board of directors their fiduciary duties and the
material terms of the proposed merger agreement. Also at this special meeting, representatives of Sandler O’Neill reviewed with the
First Financial board of directors Sandler O’Neill’s financial analysis of the exchange ratio and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion, dated July 25, 2017, to the First Financial board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and
based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and qualifications on
the review undertaken as described in such opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to First Financial.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The board of directors discussed the rationale for and analysis of the transaction, its financial terms and other terms in the merger
agreement. The board of directors asked numerous questions of First Financial’s management, legal counsel, and financial advisors
in evaluating and considering these matters. Following these discussions and review and discussion among the members of the First
Financial board of directors, including consideration of the factors described under “—First Financial’s Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the First Financial Board of Directors,” the First Financial board of directors unanimously determined that the
merger with MainSource was advisable and in the best interests of First Financial and voted unanimously to adopt the merger
agreement, to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and to recommend that First Financial’s
shareholders approve the merger agreement.

Also on July 25, 2017, the MainSource board of directors met to consider and discuss the terms of the proposed merger with First
Financial. MainSource’s management and legal and financial advisors were also participants at this meeting. MainSource’s legal
counsel presented the final draft of the merger agreement and discussed the revisions to the agreement since the board’s meeting on
July 19, 2017. The board and management MainSource’s legal counsel also discussed the regulatory review and approval process
for the merger. KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered to the MainSource board an opinion
(which was initially rendered verbally and confirmed in writing by delivery of KBW’s written opinion, dated July 25, 2017) to the
effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of MainSource common stock.

The MainSource board discussed the merger agreement and the exchange ratio at length and asked many questions of MainSource’s
management and legal and financial advisors. The board reviewed again the strategic rationale for the merger compared to the
prospects and challenges with remaining independent or pursuing other corporate or strategic opportunities. The board discussed at
length the overall structure of the proposed merger transaction including the financial, organizational, and strategic opportunities
created by the merger. Following a lengthy discussion, and for the reasons described under “—MainSource’s Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the MainSource Board of Directors,” the MainSource board of directors unanimously determined that
the merger with First Financial was advisable and in the best interests of MainSource and voted unanimously to adopt the merger
agreement, to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and to recommend that MainSource’s
shareholders approve the merger agreement.

On the afternoon of July 25, 2017, the parties finalized and executed the merger agreement. Following market close on July 25,
2017, MainSource and First Financial issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

First Financial’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of First Financial’s Board of Directors

In evaluating the merger, the First Financial board of directors consulted with First Financial management, as well as independent
legal and financial advisors, and, in the course of reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement, to approve the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to recommend that First Financial’s shareholders adopt the merger
agreement, the First Financial board of directors considered a number of factors, including the following material factors:

• its understanding of the current and prospective environment in which First Financial and MainSource operate, including
national and local economic conditions, the interest rate environment, increased operating costs resulting from regulatory
initiatives and compliance mandates as a result of exceeding $10 billion in total assets, the competitive environment for
financial institutions generally, and the likely effect of these factors on First Financial both with and without the proposed
transaction;

• each of First Financial’s, MainSource’s, and the combined company’s business, operations, financial condition, asset
quality, earnings, and prospects. In reviewing these factors, the First Financial board of directors considered its view that
MainSource’s financial condition and asset quality were sound, that MainSource’s business and operations complemented
those of First Financial, and that the merger would result in a combined company with a larger market presence and more
diversified product mix as well as an attractive funding base, including through core deposit funding, and stronger asset
quality. The First Financial board of directors further considered that MainSource’s earnings and prospects, and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

synergies potentially available in the proposed transaction, created an opportunity for the combined company to have
superior future earnings and prospects compared to First Financial’s earnings and prospects on a stand-alone basis. In
particular, the First Financial board of directors considered the following:

• the potential for combining two high-performing Midwest community banks which would have industry leading
profitability and efficiency, a stable, low-cost funding base, and would be well-positioned for an increasing interest
rate environment;

• the complementary nature of the customers and markets of First Financial and MainSource across Ohio, Indiana, and
Kentucky with continued expansion in key markets such as Cincinnati and Indianapolis and the creation of an
immediate sizable position in Louisville;

• the long histories (over 100 years) of each company built on strong core values and the similarity of the companies’
cultures and operating philosophies;

• each company’s history of successful acquisitions providing the necessary experience for estimating potential cost
savings as well as planning and executing the integration;

• the complementary nature of First Financial’s and MainSource’s banking products including high quality, low risk
loan portfolios;

• the similarity of the businesses and management teams;

• the strength of MainSource’s retail base including its favorable composition of core deposits which First Financial
intends to leverage across the combined footprint going forward;

• the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the combined
company given its larger size, asset base, capital, and footprint;

• its review and discussions with First Financial’s management and advisors concerning First Financial’s due diligence
examination of MainSource’s business;

• the regulatory implications for the combined organization, including the fact that although the combined organization
will cross well over the $10 billion threshold resulting in greater regulatory burdens, the merger serves as an efficient
and effective means of offsetting the costs of moving beyond this threshold;

• the anticipated pro forma financial impact of the merger on the combined company, including an estimated 5%
accretion, or $0.09 in First Financial’s earnings per share in 2018, and 9% accretion, or $0.17 in earnings per share in
2019 (exclusive of restructuring charges and inclusive of estimated cost savings);

• the anticipated positive impact of the merger on the combined company’s capital position, including regulatory
capital levels, and the combined company’s potential ability to generate substantial internal capital to support future
growth;

• the participation of six of MainSource’s directors in the combined company which the First Financial board of
directors believed would enhance the likelihood of realizing the strategic benefits that First Financial expects to
derive from the merger;

• the strength of the combined management team following completion of the merger which will provide First
Financial with the necessary depth to support a larger institution and position First Financial for future growth;

• the expectation that the transaction will be generally tax-free for United States federal income tax purposes to First
Financial’s shareholders;

• the financial analyses of Sandler O’Neill presented on July 25, 2017 to the First Financial board of directors, as well
as the related opinion of Sandler O’Neill, dated July 25, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based on and
subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Sandler O’Neill, as more fully
described in the opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,
to First Financial;

• the fact that First Financial’s shareholders will have a chance to vote on the merger; and

• its review with First Financial’s independent legal advisor, Squire Patton Boggs, of the terms of the merger
agreement, including deal protection and termination fee provisions.

The First Financial board of directors also considered potential risks relating to the merger but concluded that the anticipated
benefits of the merger were likely to substantially outweigh these risks. These potential risks included:

• the possibility of encountering difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings in the amounts estimated or in the time
frame contemplated;

• the possibility of encountering difficulties in successfully integrating MainSource’s business, operations, and workforce
with those of First Financial;

• the transaction-related restructuring charges and other merger-related costs, including the payments and other benefits to
be received by MainSource management in connection with the merger pursuant to existing MainSource plans and
compensation arrangements and the merger agreement;

• initial dilution to tangible book value per common share is estimated to be $0.64 or 5.4% at closing, which First
Financial’s management believes can be earned back within approximately three years;

• diversion of management attention and resources from the operation of First Financial’s business towards the completion
of the merger; and

• the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the merger and the risk that such regulatory approvals will
not be received in a timely manner or may impose unacceptable conditions.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the First Financial board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the First Financial board of directors. In reaching its decision to adopt the
merger agreement, to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to recommend that
First Financial’s shareholders adopt the merger agreement, the First Financial board of directors did not quantify or assign any
relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The First
Financial board of directors considered all these factors as a whole and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to
support, its determination.

For the reasons set forth above, the First Financial board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of First Financial and unanimously voted
to adopt the merger agreement, to approve the merger and the transactions contemplated by it, and to recommend that First
Financial’s shareholders adopt the merger agreement.

The First Financial board of directors unanimously recommends that First Financial shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the
merger proposal and other merger-related proposals.

It should be noted that this explanation of the First Financial board of directors’ reasoning presented in this section contains
information that is forward-looking in nature, and therefore should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 23.

Opinion of Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P.

Sandler O’Neill acted as an independent financial advisor in connection with the proposed transaction and participated in certain of
the negotiations leading to the execution of the merger agreement. At the July 25, 2017 meeting at which the First Financial board
considered and approved the merger agreement, Sandler O’Neill delivered to the First Financial board its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement was
fair to First Financial from a financial point of view. The full text of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Annex B to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion outlines the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the
opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. First Financial shareholders are
urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with their consideration of First Financial’s merger proposal.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was directed to the First Financial board in
connection with its consideration of the merger and is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio to First Financial. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any First Financial
shareholder as to how such First Financial shareholder should vote at any meeting of shareholders called to consider and
vote upon the First Financial share issuance proposal. It does not address the underlying business decision of First Financial
to engage in the merger, the form or structure of the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business strategies that might exist for First Financial, or the effect of any other transaction in which First
Financial might engage. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation
to be received in the merger by any First Financial or MainSource officers, directors, or employees, or class of such persons, if any,
relative to the compensation to be received in the merger by any other shareholders. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was approved by
Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed and considered, among other things:

• an execution copy of the merger agreement, dated July 25, 2017;

• certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of First Financial that Sandler
O’Neill deemed relevant;

• certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of MainSource that Sandler
O’Neill deemed relevant;

• publicly available median analyst earnings per share estimates for First Financial for the years ending December 31, 2017
and December 31, 2018 and estimated dividends per share for the year ending December 31, 2017;

• long-term First Financial earnings per share growth rates for the years after the year ending December 31, 2018 and
dividend payout ratios for the years after the year ending December 31, 2017, as discussed with the senior management of
First Financial;

• publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for MainSource for the years ending December 31, 2017
and December 31, 2018;

• estimated dividends per share for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and estimated long-term
earnings per share growth rates and dividend payout ratios for the years thereafter, as discussed with the senior
management of MainSource;

• the pro forma financial impact of the merger on First Financial based on certain assumptions relating to transaction
expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings, and anticipated regulatory and compliance costs, as provided by
the senior management of First Financial;

• the relative contribution of assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings of First Financial and MainSource to the combined
entity;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for First Financial common stock and MainSource common
stock, including a comparison of certain stock trading information for First Financial common stock, MainSource common
stock, and certain stock indices as well as similar publicly available information for certain other companies the securities
of which are publicly traded;

• a comparison of certain financial information for First Financial and MainSource with similar bank institutions for which
information is publicly available;

• the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry (on a nationwide basis), to the
extent publicly available;

• the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and

• such other information, financial studies, analyses, and investigations and financial, economic, and market criteria as
Sandler O’Neill considered relevant.

Sandler O’Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of First Financial the business, financial condition,
results of operations, and prospects of First Financial and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior management
of MainSource and its representatives regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of
MainSource.

In performing its review, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information
that was available to and reviewed by Sandler O’Neill from public sources, that was provided to Sandler O’Neill by First Financial,
MainSource, or their respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by Sandler O’Neill and Sandler O’Neill assumed
such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion without any independent verification or investigation. Sandler
O’Neill further relied on the assurances of the respective managements of First Financial and MainSource that they are not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would have made any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Sandler O’Neill was not asked
to and did not undertake an independent verification of any of such information and Sandler O’Neill did not assume any
responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation or
perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of First Financial
or MainSource, nor was Sandler O’Neill furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Sandler O’Neill rendered no opinion or
evaluation on the collectability of any assets or the future performance of any loans of First Financial or MainSource. Sandler
O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of First Financial or MainSource,
or the combined entity after the merger and Sandler O’Neill did not review any individual credit files relating to First Financial or
MainSource. Sandler O’Neill assumed, with First Financial’s consent, that the respective allowances for loan losses for both First
Financial and MainSource are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available median analyst earnings per share estimates for First Financial for
the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, estimated dividends per share for the year ending December 31, 2017,
long-term earnings per share growth rates for the years after the year ending December 31, 2018 and long-term dividend payout
ratios for the years after the year ending December 31, 2017, as discussed with the senior management of First Financial. In
addition, in preparing its analyses Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for
MainSource for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, estimated dividends per share for the years ending
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, estimated long-term earnings per share growth rates for the years after the year ending
December 31, 2018 and long-term dividend payout ratios for the years after the year ending December 31, 2018, as discussed with
the senior management of MainSource. Sandler O’Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions
relating to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings, and anticipated regulatory and compliance costs, as
provided by the senior management of First Financial. With respect to the foregoing information, the respective managements of
First Financial and MainSource confirmed to Sandler O’Neill that such information reflected (or, in the case of the publicly
available analyst earnings per share estimates referred to above, were consistent with) the best currently available projections,
estimates, and judgments of those respective managements of the future financial performance of First Financial and MainSource,
respectively, and Sandler O’Neill assumed that such performance would be achieved. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to
such information, or the assumptions on which such information was based. Sandler O’Neill also assumed that there had been no
material change in First

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Financial’s or MainSource’s assets, financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects since the date of the most recent
financial statements made available to Sandler O’Neill. Sandler O’Neill assumed in all respects material to its analysis that First
Financial and MainSource will remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to Sandler O’Neill’s analyses.

Sandler O’Neill also assumed, with First Financial’s consent, that (i) each of the parties to the merger agreement will comply in all
material respects with all material terms and conditions of the merger agreement and all related agreements, that all of the
representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to
such agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such
party under such agreements, and that the conditions precedent in such agreements were not and will not be waived, (ii) in the
course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents, and releases with respect to the merger, no delay,
limitation, restriction, or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on First Financial, MainSource. or the merger
or any related transaction, (iii) the merger and any related transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement without any waiver, modification, or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in
compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements, and (iv) the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal
income tax purposes. Finally, with First Financial’s consent, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the advice that First Financial received
from its legal, accounting, and tax advisors as to all legal, accounting, and tax matters relating to the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to any such matters.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market, and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Sandler O’Neill as of, the date thereof. Events occurring after the date thereof could materially affect
Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. Sandler O’Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm, or withdraw its opinion or otherwise
comment upon events occurring after the date thereof. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to the trading values of First
Financial common stock or MainSource common stock at any time or what the value of First Financial common stock will be once
it is actually received by the holders of MainSource common stock.

In rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill performed a variety of financial analyses. The summary below is not a complete
description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation made by Sandler O’Neill to the First Financial board,
but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, these tables must be
read together with the accompanying text. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. The process, therefore, is not
necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. Sandler O’Neill believes that its analyses must be considered as
a whole and that selecting portions of the factors and analyses to be considered without considering all factors and analyses, or
attempting to ascribe relative weights to some or all such factors and analyses, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation
process underlying its opinion. Also, no company included in Sandler O’Neill’s comparative analyses described below is identical
to First Financial or MainSource, and no transaction is identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of comparable companies or
transactions involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies and other factors that could affect the public trading values or merger transaction values, as the case may be, of First
Financial and MainSource and the companies to which they are being compared. In arriving at its opinion, Sandler O’Neill did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Sandler O’Neill did not form an opinion as to whether any individual
analysis or factor (positive or negative) considered in isolation supported or failed to support its opinion, rather, Sandler O’Neill
made its determination as to the fairness of the exchange ratio on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all its analyses taken as a whole.

In performing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market, and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Sandler O’Neill, First
Financial, and MainSource. The analyses performed by Sandler O’Neill are not

necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, both of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. Sandler O’Neill prepared its analyses solely for purposes of rendering its opinion and provided such analyses to First
Financial’s board of directors at its July 25, 2017 meeting. Estimates on the values of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, Sandler O’Neill’s
analyses do not necessarily reflect the value of First Financial common stock or the prices at which First Financial common stock or
MainSource common stock may be sold at any time Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was among several factors taken into consideration
by the First Financial board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, the
analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the First Financial board with respect to the
fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation
between First Financial and MainSource and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the First Financial
board.

Summary of Proposed Merger Consideration and Implied Transaction Metrics

Sandler O’Neill reviewed the financial terms of the proposed merger. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon the
effective time of the merger, each share of MainSource common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately before the
effective date, except for certain shares of MainSource Common Stock as specified in the merger agreement, shall be converted into
and exchanged for the right to receive 1.3875 shares of common stock of First Financial. Using First Financial’s July 25, 2017
closing stock price of $28.10 and based upon the following (as provided by MainSource management), (a) 25,575,804 shares of
MainSource common stock outstanding and 36,442 performance share units that are assumed to be converted to common stock at
close, (b) 115,417 outstanding MainSource options with a weighted average strike price of $11.36, and (c) 572,813 outstanding
MainSource warrants outstanding with a weighted average strike price of $14.92, Sandler O’Neill calculated an implied transaction
value per share of $38.99 and an aggregate implied transaction value of approximately $1.0 billion. Based upon historical financial
information for MainSource as of or for the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended June 30, 2017, Sandler O’Neill calculated the
following implied transaction metrics:
Transaction Price / MainSource LTM Earnings Per Share(1)  19.3x
Transaction Price / MainSource 2017 Median Analyst Estimated Earnings Per Share  18.3x
Transaction Price / MainSource 2018 Median Analyst Estimated Earnings Per Share  16.4x
Transaction Price / MainSource Book Value Per Share  193%
Transaction Price / MainSource Tangible Book Value Per Share  272%
Tangible Book Premium / Core Deposits(2)  19.3%
Market Premium as of July 25, 2017  15.3%

(1) Excludes $4.8 million in after tax merger adjustments incurred during last twelve months

(2) Core deposits excludes time deposit accounts greater than $100,000; Premium based on consideration to MainSource shareholders

Net Present Value Analyses

Sandler O’Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of First Financial’s common stock, assuming
First Financial performed in accordance with publicly available analyst median consensus earnings per share estimates for First
Financial for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and estimated dividends per share for the year ending
December 31, 2017, as well as long-term earnings per share growth rates for the years after the year ending December 31, 2018 and
long-term dividend payout ratios for the years after the year ending December 31, 2017, as discussed and confirmed with the senior
management of First Financial. To approximate the terminal value of First Financial common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler
O’Neill applied price to 2021 earnings per share multiples ranging from 16.0x to 21.0x and multiples of December 31, 2021
tangible book value per share ranging from 180% to 260%. The terminal values were then discounted to present values using
different discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5%, which were chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of
return of holders or prospective buyers of First Financial common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the analysis indicated
an imputed range of values per share of First Financial common stock of $23.03 to $33.09 when applying multiples of earnings per
share and $20.31 to $31.68 when applying multiples of tangible book value per share.

Sandler O’Neill also considered and discussed with the First Financial board of directors how this analysis would be affected by
changes in the underlying assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Sandler O’Neill
performed a similar analysis, assuming First Financial’s net income varied from 20% above estimates to 20% below estimates. This
analysis resulted in the following range of per share values for First Financial common stock, applying the price to 2021 earnings
per share multiples ranging from 16.0x to 21.0x referred to above and a discount rate of 10.00%.

Sandler O’Neill also performed two analyses that estimated the net present value per share of MainSource common stock under
various circumstances. The first analysis assumed MainSource performed in accordance with publicly available analyst consensus
estimates for MainSource for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and estimated dividends per share for the
years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated long-term earnings per share growth rates for the
years thereafter and long-term dividend payout ratios for the years after the year ending December 31, 2018, as discussed and
confirmed with the senior management of MainSource (the “MainSource Stand Alone NPV Analysis”). For the second analysis,
Sandler O’Neill used the same assumptions as the MainSource Stand Alone NPV Analysis, but also included assumptions related to
after-tax cost savings, as discussed with the senior management of First Financial (the “MainSource Adjusted NPV Analysis”).

For both the MainSource Stand Alone NPV Analysis and MainSource Adjusted NPV Analysis, to approximate the terminal value of
MainSource common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2021 earnings per share multiples ranging from
16.0x to 21.0x and multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value per share ranging from 160% to 250%. The terminal values
were then discounted to present values using different discount rates ranging from 9.5% to 12.5%, which were chosen to reflect
different assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of MainSource common stock. As
illustrated in the following tables, the MainSource Stand Alone NPV Analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of
MainSource common stock of $29.52 to $42.76 when applying multiples of earnings per share and the MainSource Adjusted NPV
Analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of MainSource common stock of $40.57 to $59.14 when applying multiples
of earnings per share. In addition, as illustrated in the following tables, the MainSource Stand Alone NPV Analysis indicated an
imputed range of values per share of MainSource common stock of $24.16 to $40.88 when applying multiples of tangible book
value per share and

In connection with its analyses, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the First Financial board of directors how the present
value analyses would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions. Sandler O’Neill noted that the net present value
analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous
assumptions that must be made, and the results thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis

Sandler O’Neill analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger on First Financial assuming the merger close at the end of
the first calendar quarter of 2018. Sandler O’Neill utilized the following information and assumptions: (i) publicly available median
analyst earnings per share estimates for First Financial for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and
estimated dividends per share for the year ending December 31, 2017, as well as long-term earnings per share growth rates for the
years after the year ending December 31, 2018 and long-term dividend payout ratios for the years after the year ending December
31, 2017, as discussed and confirmed with the senior management of First Financial, (ii) publicly available consensus analyst
earnings per share estimates for MainSource for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and estimated long-
term annual asset and earnings per share growth rates, dividends per share for the year ending December 31, 2017 and December
31, 2018 and long-term dividend payout ratio for years thereafter, as discussed and confirmed with the senior management of
MainSource, and (iii) certain assumptions related to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, as well as certain cost
savings assumptions, as provided by the senior management of First Financial. The analysis indicated that the merger could be
accretive to First Financial’s earnings per share (excluding one-time transaction costs and expenses) in the years ending December
31, 2018 and thereafter and dilutive to First Financial’s estimated tangible book value per share at close.

In connection with this analysis, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the First Financial board how the analysis would be
affected by changes in the underlying assumptions and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary
from projected results and the variations may be material.

to reimburse Sandler O’Neill for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Sandler O’Neill’s engagement.
Sandler O’Neill did not provide any other investment banking services to First Financial in the two years preceding the date of its
opinion, nor did Sandler O’Neill provide any investment banking services to MainSource in the two years preceding the date
thereof. In the ordinary course of its business as a broker-dealer, Sandler O’Neill may purchase securities from or sell securities to
First Financial, MainSource, or their respective affiliates. Sandler O’Neill may also actively trade the equity or debt securities of
First Financial, MainSource, or their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers.

MainSource’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of MainSource’s Board of Directors

After careful consideration, the MainSource board of directors, at a meeting held on July 25, 2017, determined that the merger with
First Financial is in the best interests of MainSource and its shareholders and approved and declared advisable the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated therein, including the merger, and recommends that MainSource’s shareholders vote “FOR” the
adoption of the MainSource merger proposal. In reaching its decision to approve and recommend the adoption of the merger
agreement, the MainSource board of directors evaluated the merger agreement and the merger in consultation with MainSource’s
management, as well as MainSource’s financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following
material factors which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:

• the belief that the merger will create a premier Midwest community bank with a meaningful presence in large, high-
growth metropolitan markets, including Northwest Indiana, Louisville, Kentucky, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Cincinnati
and Columbus, Ohio, with industry leading profitability and efficiency;

• the anticipated earnings per share accretion for MainSource shareholders as a result of the merger;

• the anticipated increase in the dividend of approximately $0.066 per share, based upon MainSource’s and First Financial’s
third quarter 2017 dividends, to be paid to MainSource’s shareholders based on First Financial’s current and forecasted
dividend payout ratio;

• the proposed terms of the merger transaction with First Financial and the value of the proposed terms to MainSource
shareholders, including the attractive valuation, which allows MainSource shareholders to lock in stock price appreciation
gains to date plus a premium of 15.3% based upon the closing prices of MainSource common stock and First Financial
stock on July 25, 2017, the day of the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement;

• the fact that MainSource shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company following the merger;

• the significant overlap of the two bank franchises, including the fact that 35% of First Financial deposits are within 5 miles
of a MainSource branch, which provides an opportunity for the combined company to achieve significant cost savings
through branch closures without affecting customer service;

• the expectation that the merger will result in approximately $43 million in annual net cost savings following the
completion of the merger and full integration of the two companies;

• the business, earnings, operations, financial condition, stock price, performance, management, prospects, capital levels,
and credit quality of each of MainSource and First Financial, based upon MainSource’s diligence of First Financial;

• the current and prospective business and economic environment of the banking industry, the scarcity of prospects for
acquisition within the markets in which MainSource operates, and in particular the Indianapolis market, the competitive
pricing for acquisition targets and the regulatory burdens on financial institutions;

4th largest bank by deposit market share in Cincinnati, Ohio;

• the overall size of the combined company, which will position it to cross over the $10 billion asset threshold in an efficient
and meaningful way, thereby reducing the potential negative impact on the combined company’s earnings as a result of its
assets exceeding $10 billion, including the limit on the amount of debit card interchange fees that the combined company
will be able to charge under the Durbin Amendment under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the increased regulatory burden and
cost on the bank of having total assets in excess of $10 billion, including becoming subject to oversight by the CFPB;

the resulting footprint, cultural compatibility, and ability to pay for each potential merger partner;

strategic merger with First Financial, including remaining independent, continuing to grow through de novo branching or
acquisitions, merger of equals, or acquisition by a larger merger partner;

Financial’s diversified business lines, to create an even stronger, more competitive financial institution;

• the fact that the management team of the combined company will consist of current executives of both MainSource and
First Financial, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of MainSource, which will allow for
management continuity, deeper experience and greater opportunities for succession planning;

• the fact that the board of directors following the merger will consist of nine current directors of First Financial and six
current directors of MainSource, which will allow MainSource to have a significant influence on the organization
following the merger and which the MainSource board of directors believes will enhance the likelihood of realizing the
strategic benefits that the combined company expects to derive from the merger;

• the complementary and compatible aspects of the business of MainSource and First Financial, including similar cultures,
similar focus on the communities in which the banks operate and similar management philosophies with respect to credit
and operations;

• the compatible credit metrics and credit cultures (both strong), plus increased lending limits available in the merged
company;

• the potential revenue synergy opportunities resulting from the merger, including opportunities to cross-sell expanded
products and services to a larger combined customer base and to larger customers;

the five years following the merger for charitable or community groups and the retention of at least 100 jobs in
Greensburg;

• the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the combined
company given its larger size, asset base, capital, lending capacity, and footprint;

the opinion, to the holders of MainSource common stock of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger, as more fully
described below under “—Opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.”;

• terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal
(subject to payment of a $40 million termination fee); and

• terminate the merger agreement in the event of a decline in First Financial’s stock price by a certain amount in excess
of a certain decline in the KBW regional banking index; and

• the MainSource board of directors’ review and discussions with its management, financial and legal advisors concerning
MainSource’s due diligence examination of First Financial’s business and the terms of the merger agreement.

The board of directors of MainSource also considered the potential risks related to the merger but concluded that the anticipated
benefits of the merger were likely to substantially outweigh these risks. These potential risks included:

• that the exchange ratio for the merger consideration is fixed, so that if the market price of First Financial common stock is
lower at the time of the closing of the merger, the implied market value of the per share merger consideration to be
received by MainSource’s shareholders in exchange for their shares of MainSource common stock will also be lower;

• the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully integrating
MainSource’s business, operations, and workforce with those of First Financial, or achieving anticipated cost synergies
and savings within the expected period of time;

• the transaction-related restructuring charges and other merger-related costs;

• the risk that the market would react negatively to First Financial’s announcement of the merger transaction;

• the potential impact of the merger on MainSource’s employees on communities, including the anticipated loss of jobs and
branch closures;

• the reduction in board and management control of the combined entity;

• the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of MainSource’s business and
towards the completion of the merger;

• the fact that MainSource will incur substantial transaction costs even if the merger is not consummated; and

• the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the merger and the expectation that such regulatory
approvals will be received in a timely manner and without the imposition of unacceptable conditions.

In addition, the MainSource board of directors was aware of and considered the fact that some of MainSource’s directors and
executive officers may have other interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition

to, their interests as MainSource shareholders, as more fully described under “—Interests of MainSource’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.” The MainSource board of directors also realized that there can be no assurance about future results,
including results expected or considered in the factors listed above.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the MainSource board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the MainSource board of directors. In reaching its decision to approve
the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the MainSource board of
directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different
weights to different factors. The MainSource board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, and overall considered the
factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

Opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

MainSource engaged Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW”) to render financial advisory and investment banking services to
MainSource, including an opinion to the MainSource board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of MainSource common stock of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger of MainSource with and into First Financial.
MainSource selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of
financial services businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the MainSource board held on July 25, 2017, at which
the MainSource board evaluated the proposed merger. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger
and rendered to the MainSource board an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its
opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of MainSource common
stock. The MainSource board approved the merger agreement at this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached
as Annex C to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the
MainSource board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The
opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the merger to the holders of
MainSource common stock. It did not address the underlying business decision of MainSource to engage in the merger or
enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the MainSource board in connection with the merger,
and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of MainSource common stock or any shareholder of any other
entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation
regarding whether or not any such shareholder should enter into a voting, shareholders’ or affiliates’ agreement with
respect to the merger or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder.

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and procedures
established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of MainSource and First Financial and bearing upon the merger, including, among other things:

• a draft of the merger agreement, dated July 19, 2017 (the most recent draft then made available to KBW);

• the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016
of MainSource;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the unaudited quarterly financial statements and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 of
MainSource;

• certain draft and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of MainSource (provided to
KBW by representatives of MainSource);

• the audited financial statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of
First Financial;

• the unaudited quarterly financial results and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 of First
Financial;

• certain other interim reports and other communications of MainSource and First Financial to their respective shareholders;
and

• other financial information concerning the businesses and operations of MainSource and First Financial that was furnished
to KBW by MainSource and First Financial or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of KBW’s
analyses.

KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to its
analyses included, among others, the following:

• the historical and current financial position and results of operations of MainSource and First Financial;

• the assets and liabilities of MainSource and First Financial;

• the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;

• a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for MainSource and First Financial with similar
information for certain other companies the securities of which were publicly traded;

• publicly available consensus “street estimates” of MainSource, as well as assumed long-term MainSource growth rates
provided to KBW by MainSource management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by MainSource
management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and with the consent of the
MainSource board;

• publicly available consensus “street estimates” of First Financial, as well as assumed long-term First Financial growth
rates provided to KBW by First Financial management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by First
Financial management and used and relied upon by KBW based on such discussions, at the direction of MainSource
management and with the consent of the MainSource board; and

• estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on First Financial (including, without limitation, the
cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger) that were prepared by, and provided to
and discussed with KBW by, First Financial management and that were used and relied upon by KBW based on such
discussions, at the direction of MainSource management and with the consent of the MainSource board.

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general
economic, market, and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well as its experience in securities valuation
and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions held by the managements of MainSource
and First Financial regarding the past and current

business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition, and future prospects of their respective companies and such other
matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry. KBW was not requested to, and did not, assist MainSource in soliciting indications
of interest from third parties other than First Financial regarding a potential transaction with MainSource.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information that was provided to it or that was publicly available and KBW did not independently verify the
accuracy or completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or
completeness. KBW relied upon the management of MainSource as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available
consensus “street estimates” of MainSource and the assumed MainSource long-term growth rates referred to above (and the
assumptions and bases therefor), and KBW assumed that all such information was reasonably prepared and represented, or in the
case of the MainSource “street estimates” referred to above that such estimates were consistent with, the best currently available
estimates and judgments of such management and that the forecasts, projections, and estimates reflected in such information would
be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated. KBW further relied, with the consent of MainSource, upon First
Financial management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of First
Financial, the assumed First Financial long-term growth rates, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the
merger on First Financial, all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information, including, without
limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger), and KBW assumed that all such
information was reasonably prepared and represented, or in the case of the First Financial “street estimates” referred to above that
such estimates were consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of First Financial management and that the
forecasts, projections, and estimates reflected in such information would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods
estimated.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of MainSource and First Financial that was provided to KBW
was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of MainSource and First Financial, was based on numerous variables, and assumptions that
are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that,
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed, based on discussions
with the respective managements of MainSource and First Financial and with the consent of the MainSource board, that all such
information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW could form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such
information or the assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis
and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business,
or prospects of either MainSource or First Financial since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made
available to KBW. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and
KBW assumed, without independent verification and with MainSource’s consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease
losses for MainSource and First Financial are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain
any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of MainSource or
First Financial, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW examine
any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability, or fair value of MainSource or First
Financial under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or other matters. Estimates of values of
companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be
sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, KBW assumed no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:

• that the merger and any related transactions (including the subsidiary bank merger) would be completed substantially in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in
any respect material to KBW’s analyses from the draft reviewed and referred to above) with no adjustments to the
exchange ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of MainSource common stock;

• that the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments
referred to in the merger agreement were true and correct;

• that each party to the merger agreement and all related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by such party under such documents;

• that there were no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental
approval for the merger or any related transactions (including the subsidiary bank merger) and that all conditions to the
completion of the merger and any related transaction would be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the
merger agreement or any of the related documents; and

• that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the merger and any
related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements,
termination or other payments, or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a material adverse
effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of MainSource, First Financial, or the pro forma entity, or
the contemplated benefits of the merger, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the merger.

KBW assumed that the merger would be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules,
and regulations. KBW was further advised by representatives of MainSource that MainSource relied upon advice from its advisors
(other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting, and regulatory matters with
respect to MainSource, First Financial, the merger and any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), and the
merger agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the exchange ratio in the
merger to the holders of MainSource common stock. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the
merger or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), including without limitation, the
form or structure of the merger or any such related transaction, any consequences of the merger or any such related transaction to
MainSource, its shareholders, creditors, or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits, or implications of any employment, consulting,
voting, support, shareholder, or other agreements, arrangements, or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with
the merger or otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date
of such opinion and the information made available to KBW through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW’s
opinion may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did not and does not have an
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. For purposes of its analyses, KBW did not incorporate then recently-announced
proposed changes to United States tax laws regarding corporate tax rates. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no
view or opinion with respect to:

• the underlying business decision of MainSource to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement;

• the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been, or may be available to or
contemplated by MainSource or the MainSource board;

• the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of MainSource’s officers, directors, or employees, or any
class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of MainSource common stock;

• the effect of the merger or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any
class of securities of MainSource (other than the holders of MainSource common stock, solely with respect to the
exchange ratio as described in KBW’s opinion and not relative to the consideration to be received by holders of any other
class of securities) or holders of any class of securities of First Financial or any other party to any transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement;

• any adjustment (as provided in the merger agreement) to the exchange ratio assumed for purposes of KBW’s opinion;

• the actual value of First Financial common stock to be issued in the merger;

• the prices, trading range, or volume at which MainSource common stock or First Financial common stock would trade
following the public announcement of the merger or the prices, trading range, or volume at which First Financial common
stock would trade following the consummation of the merger;

• any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the merger or any other transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement; or

• any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, or similar matters relating to MainSource, First Financial, their respective
shareholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the merger or any related transaction (including the
subsidiary bank merger), including whether or not the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States
federal income tax purposes.

In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market, and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, MainSource, and First Financial. Any
estimates contained in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold.
Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, KBW’s opinion was among
several factors taken into consideration by the MainSource board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and
the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the MainSource
board with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were
determined through negotiation between MainSource and First Financial and the decision of MainSource to enter into the merger
agreement was solely that of the MainSource board.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the MainSource board in connection with its
opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation
made by KBW to the MainSource board, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with
such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic
process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but
rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that
its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the merger of $1,001.0
million, or $38.43 per outstanding share of MainSource common stock, based on the 1.3875x exchange ratio in the proposed merger
and the closing price of First Financial common stock on July 21, 2017. In addition to the financial analyses described below, KBW
reviewed with the MainSource board for

TABLE OF CONTENTS

informational purposes, among other things, implied transaction multiples for the proposed merger (based on the implied transaction
value for the merger of $1,001.0 million) of 18.4x MainSource’s estimated 2017 net income and 16.1x MainSource’s estimated
2018 net income using publicly available consensus “street estimates” of MainSource.

MainSource Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance,
financial condition and market performance of MainSource to 13 selected banks which were traded on NASDAQ, the New York
Stock Exchange, or the New York Stock Exchange Market and headquartered in the Midwest United States and which had total
assets between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion. Merger targets were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:
1st Source Corporation Midland States Bancorp, Inc.
Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc.
Enterprise Financial Services Corp Peoples Bancorp Inc.
Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. QCR Holdings, Inc.
Horizon Bancorp Republic Bancorp, Inc.
Lakeland Financial Corporation Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc.
Mercantile Bank Corporation  

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information as of, or for the fiscal quarter or latest 12 months
(“LTM”) period ended, March 31, 2017 (or, where noted in the case of MainSource, June 30, 2017) and market price information as
of July 21, 2017. Assets, capital ratios, balance sheet data, and book value and tangible book value multiples for Midland States
Bancorp, Inc., QCR Holdings, Inc., and Horizon Bancorp were pro forma for pending or recently completed acquisitions. KBW also
used 2017 and 2018 earnings per share (“EPS”) estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for MainSource and the selected
companies. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data
presented in MainSource’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared by Sandler O’Neill presented under the section “—
Opinion of Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P.,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to
compute the financial data presented.

KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the financial performance of MainSource and the selected companies:

and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Select Transactions Analysis. KBW reviewed publicly available information related to 13 selected U.S. whole bank transactions
announced since January 1, 2016, with announced transaction values between $500 million and $2.0 billion. Terminated
transactions and transactions with non-bank acquirors were excluded from the selected transactions.

The selected transactions were as follows:
Acquiror Acquired Company
Union Bankshares Corporation Xenith Bankshares, Inc.
Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc.
South State Corporation Park Sterling Corporation
PacWest Bancorp CU Bancorp
Home BancShares, Inc. Stoegate Bank
IBERIABANK Corporation Sabadell United Bank, N.A.
Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. BNC Bancorp
Columbia Banking System, Inc. Pacific Continental Corporation
Simmons First National Corporation Southwest Bancorp, Inc.
First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. Cascade Bancorp
United Bankshares, Inc. Cardinal Financial Corporation
F.N.B. Corporation Yadkin Financial Corporation
Chemical Financial Corporation Talmer Bancorp, Inc.

For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction
consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company’s then latest publicly
available financial statements and, to the extent publicly available, then next year EPS consensus “street estimates” prior to the
announcement of the respective transaction:

• price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private
acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM earnings);

• price per common share to next year estimated EPS of the acquired company in the 12 selected transactions in which
consensus “street estimates” for the acquired company were then available;

• price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions
involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by
total tangible common equity); and

• tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired
company, referred to as core deposit premium.

KBW also reviewed the price per common share paid for the acquired company for the 12 selected transactions involving publicly
traded acquired companies as a premium to the closing price of the acquired company one day prior to the announcement of the
acquisition (expressed as a percentage and referred to as the one day market premium). The resulting transaction multiples and
premiums for the selected transactions were compared with the corresponding transaction multiples and premiums for the proposed
merger based on the implied transaction value for the merger of $1,001.0 million and using historical financial information for
MainSource as of or through March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, consensus “street estimates” of MainSource for the next twelve
months (“NTM”), and the closing price of MainSource common stock on July 21, 2017.

The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiple for one of the selected
transactions, which multiple was considered to be not meaningful because it was greater than 50.0x):

(1) Tangible book value multiple and core deposit premium were pro forma for then pending acquisition of FCB Bancorp, Inc.

(2) Excluding non-recurring expenses from net income, the implied LTM earnings multiple for the merger would be 21.3x.

(3) Excluding non-recurring expenses from net income, the implied LTM earnings multiple for the merger would be 20.0x.

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to MainSource or the
proposed merger. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Relative Contribution Analysis. KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of First Financial and MainSource to various
pro forma balance sheet and income statement items and the pro forma market capitalization of the combined entity. This analysis
did not include purchase accounting or merger-related adjustments. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet and net
income data for First Financial and MainSource as of or through June 30, 2017, (ii) publicly available consensus “street estimates”
of First Financial and an assumed long-term EPS growth rate for First Financial provided by First Financial management, (iii)
publicly available consensus “street estimates” of MainSource and an assumed long-term EPS growth rate for MainSource provided
by MainSource management, and (iv) market price data as of July 21, 2017. The results of KBW’s analysis are set forth in the
following table, which also compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of First
Financial and MainSource shareholders in the combined company based on the 1.3875x exchange ratio provided for in the merger:

Forecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis. KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected
income statement and balance sheet information of First Financial and MainSource. Using (i) closing balance sheet estimates as of
March 31, 2018 for First Financial and MainSource, extrapolated from historical data using growth rates taken from consensus
“street estimates”, (ii) publicly available consensus “street estimates” of First Financial and an assumed long-term EPS growth rate
for First Financial provided by First Financial management, (iii) publicly available consensus “street estimates” of MainSource and
an assumed long-term EPS growth rate for MainSource provided by MainSource management, and (iv) pro forma assumptions
(including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the merger and certain accounting
adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto) provided by First Financial management, KBW analyzed the
potential financial impact of the merger on certain projected financial results of First Financial. This analysis indicated the merger
could be accretive to First Financial’s estimated 2018 EPS (excluding the impact of one-time deal charges) and estimated 2019 EPS
and could be dilutive to First Financial’s estimated tangible book value per share as of March 31, 2018. Furthermore, the analysis
indicated that, pro forma for the merger, First Financial’s Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio as of March 31, 2018 could be higher and
each of First Financial’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio, and Total
Risk Based Capital Ratio as of March 31, 2018 could be lower. For all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by First
Financial following the merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

MainSource Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis of MainSource to estimate a range
for the implied equity value of MainSource. In this analysis, KBW used publicly available consensus “street estimates” of
MainSource and assumed long-term growth rates for MainSource provided by MainSource management, and assumed discount
rates ranging from 10.0% to 14.0%. The ranges of values were derived by adding (i) the present value of the estimated excess cash
flows that MainSource could generate over the period from June 30, 2017 through December 31, 2021 as a stand alone company,
and (ii) the present value of MainSource’s implied terminal value at the end of such period. KBW assumed that MainSource would
maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In
calculating the terminal value of MainSource, KBW applied a range of 13.5x to 17.5x estimated 2022 net income. This discounted
cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of MainSource common stock of $29.85 per share to $42.67 per
share.

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly
dependent on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates,
and discount rates. The foregoing discounted cash flow analyses did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected
values of MainSource.

First Financial Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis of First Financial to estimate a
range for the implied equity value of First Financial. In this analysis, KBW used publicly available consensus “street estimates” of
First Financial and assumed long-term growth rates for First Financial provided by First Financial management, and assumed
discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 14.0%. The ranges of values were derived by adding (i) the present value of the estimated
excess cash flows that First Financial could generate over the period from June 30, 2017 through December 31, 2021 as a stand
alone company, and (ii) the present value of First Financial’s implied terminal value at the end of such period. KBW assumed that
First Financial would maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to

range of 13.5x to 17.5x estimated 2022 net income. This discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied values per
share of First Financial common stock of $21.45 per share to $30.54 per share.

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly
dependent on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates,
and discount rates. The foregoing discounted cash flow analyses did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected
values of First Financial or the pro forma combined company.

Miscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to MainSource in connection with the proposed merger and did not act as an advisor
to or agent of any other person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank
and bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking
companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking enterprises. KBW and its affiliates, in the ordinary
course of its and their broker-dealer businesses (and further to existing sales and trading relationships between a KBW broker-dealer
affiliate and each of MainSource and First Financial), may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to,
MainSource and First Financial. In addition, as a market maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a
long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of MainSource or First Financial for its and their own respective
accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and clients.

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, MainSource agreed to pay KBW a total cash fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate
merger consideration, $1,200,000 of which became payable to KBW with the rendering of its opinion, and the balance of which is
contingent upon the closing of the merger. MainSource also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
disbursements incurred in connection with its retention and to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of
KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in connection therewith. In addition to the present engagement, in the two years preceding the
date of its opinion, KBW has provided investment banking and financial advisory services to MainSource and received
compensation for such services. KBW acted as financial advisor to MainSource in connection with its April 2017 acquisition of
FCB Bancorp, Inc. In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking or financial
advisory services to First Financial. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to
MainSource or First Financial and receive compensation for such services.

Interests of First Financial’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the First Financial board of directors with respect to its adoption of the merger agreement,
First Financial shareholders should be aware that First Financial’s directors and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, those of First Financial shareholders generally. The First Financial board of directors was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in adopting the merger agreement and making its recommendation that
First Financial shareholders vote “FOR” the proposals set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see “—First
Financial’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of First Financial’s Board of Directors.”

These interests are summarized below.

Continuing Service as Directors on the First Financial Board

The First Financial board of directors after the merger will include nine of the current directors from the First Financial board of
directors as of the effective time and six directors from the current MainSource board of directors. Such continuing directors have
not yet been identified. The First Financial board of directors presently consists of thirteen directors, which will be increased to
fifteen directors effective as of the effective time of the merger.

Continuing Employment with the First Financial Surviving Corporation

It is currently expected that most executive officers of First Financial will continue their employment with First Financial following
the effective time of the merger on similar terms and conditions as in existence immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
Anthony M. Stollings, Bradley Ringwald, Paul Silva, Richard S. Dennen, John Gavigan, William R. Harrod, Shannon M. Kuhl, and
Matthew Burgess, current executive officers of First Financial, will continue as officers of First Financial following the closing of
the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Employment Agreement with Claude E. Davis

On July 25, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, First Financial entered into an Employment and Non-Competition
Agreement with its current Chief Executive Officer, Claude E. Davis, effective upon consummation of the merger, pursuant to
which Mr. Davis will serve as the Executive Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company (the “Davis Employment
Agreement”). Upon consummation of the merger, Mr. Davis’ prior employment agreement pursuant to which he served as Chief
Executive Officer of First Financial and First Financial Bank will terminate.

The Davis Employment Agreement has an initial term of three years and entitles Mr. Davis to an initial annual base salary of
$776,900. Upon expiration of the three-year term, Mr. Davis shall voluntarily resign his employment with First Financial but shall
not resign his position on the board of directors. Mr. Davis is eligible to participate in First Financial’s Annual Short-Term Incentive
Plan (with a target incentive amount equal to 60% of Mr. Davis’ annual base salary) and other employee benefit plans offered
generally to First Financial’s executive officers. During the first two years of the employment term, Mr. Davis is further eligible to
receive long-term incentive awards with a target award opportunity having a value equal to 110% of annual base salary. Long-term
incentive awards during the third year of employment shall be determined at the discretion of First Financial’s board of directors. If
Mr. Davis remains employed through the three-year term and, thereafter, resigns his employment as required by the Davis
Employment Agreement, all outstanding time-based restricted stock awards that have not yet vested shall immediately vest
notwithstanding any later vesting date provided in the applicable award agreement.

Subject to certain terms and conditions, in the event Mr. Davis remains employed through the term of his employment agreement,
terminates his employment for Good Reason, or is terminated by First Financial without Cause (as each such term is defined in the
Davis Employment Agreement), he shall be entitled to outplacement assistance, COBRA coverage, and a severance compensation
payment payable over a 24-month period equal to (i) two years of base salary plus (ii) the lesser of (x) two and one-half times Mr.
Davis’ target incentive amount under First Financial’s Annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (set at 60% of Mr. Davis’ annual base
salary) or (y) two times the three year average of the actual annual incentive awards paid (or payable) to Mr. Davis by First
Financial for the three completed calendar years that immediately precede the termination of employment.

Subject to certain terms and limitations, the Davis Employment Agreement further provides that during the term of the agreement
and for a period of two years thereafter (or 18 months in the case of the non-compete covenant), Mr. Davis may not compete with,
or solicit customers or employees of, First Financial.

Employment Arrangement with John M. Gavigan

On September 22, 2017, John M. Gavigan, the current Chief Financial Officer of First Financial, accepted an offer letter from First
Financial to become, effective upon the closing of the merger and subject to Mr. Gavigan’s continued employment by First Financial
through the effective time of the merger and the ratification of Mr. Gavigan’s arrangement by the Compensation Committee of the
surviving corporation following the merger closing, the Chief Administrative Officer of the surviving corporation. Mr. Gavigan’s
starting salary will be $310,000 annually, and he will participate in the short term incentive plan and the long term incentive plan of
First Financial, as well as other employee benefit plans offered generally to First Financial’s executive officers. Pursuant to the
letter, Mr. Gavigan’s annual target under the short term incentive plan will be 50% of his eligible base compensation, and his target
under the long term incentive plan beginning in 2018 will be 50%.

Also on September 22, 2017, Mr. Gavigan entered into a Severance and Change in Control Agreement with First Financial (the
“Gavigan Severance Agreement”). The Gavigan Severance Agreement has a term commencing upon the day immediately following
the effectiveness of the merger and continuing until April 30, 2019, and will renew automatically for successive one-year periods
unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal.

Upon termination of Mr. Gavigan without “Cause” (other than as a result of death or disability) and not in connection with a
“Change in Control” (each such term as defined in the Gavigan Severance Agreement), Mr. Gavigan will be entitled to receive the
following payments and benefits: (i) earned and unpaid base salary and vacation pay through the date of termination; (ii) continued
payment of base salary for 24 months; (iii) an amount equal to a multiple of Mr. Gavigan’s target bonus amount under the short term
incentive plan as described below; (iv) outplacement assistance at First Financial’s expense (at a cost of up to 5% of Mr. Gavigan’s
base salary); and (v) up to twelve months of the employer portion of the health insurance premium payment contributions from First
Financial. If Mr. Gavigan is a covered employee for purposes of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Section 162(m)(3) of the Code for the year in which employment terminates (or would have been a covered employee if Mr.
Gavigan had continued employment until the end of the year), the short term incentive plan severance amount payable to Mr.
Gavigan will be equal to the lesser of (i) two times the average of the short term incentive plan bonuses earned during the three
years prior to the qualifying termination (or such lesser period for which Mr. Gavigan was eligible to participate in the short term
incentive plan) or (ii) two times the short term incentive plan bonus target in effect for the year of termination. If Mr. Gavigan is not
a covered employee or if a severance benefit is being paid in connection with a Change in Control, the short term incentive plan
severance amount will be two times his target bonus amount under the short term incentive plan.

If, immediately prior to a Change in Control or during the one-year period that commences upon a Change in Control, First
Financial terminates Mr. Gavigan’s employment without Cause (other than for disability or death) or if Mr. Gavigan terminates his
employment for “Good Reason,” as defined in the Gavigan Severance Agreement, Mr. Gavigan will be entitled to receive the
following payments and benefits: (i) earned and unpaid base salary and vacation pay through the date of termination; (ii) continued
payment of base salary for 24 months; (iii) an amount equal to two times his target amount under the Short Term Incentive Plan; (iv)
outplacement assistance at First Financial’s expense (at a cost of up to 5% of Mr. Gavigan’s base salary); and (v) up to twelve
months of the employer portion of health insurance premium payment contributions from First Financial.

The Gavigan Severance Agreement also provides that during his employment with First Financial and for six months thereafter, Mr.
Gavigan must not compete with First Financial, and for two years after termination, Mr. Gavigan must not solicit customers or
employees of First Financial.

Offers of Employment to Other First Financial Executive Officers

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, we have delivered standard offers of employment to certain other First Financial
executive officers, including William R. Harrod, Shannon M. Kuhl, Bradley Ringwald, and Paul Silva, each of which has been
accepted and provides for employment with the surviving corporation. Such offers provide for a base salary, target annual incentive
compensation and standard benefits. Each of the offers of employment is conditioned upon (i) closing of the merger, (ii) continued
employment by the offeree through the effective time of the merger, (iii) if the individual was previously a party to a severance or
change in control agreement, execution of a Severance and Change in Control Agreement, as described below under “—Severance
and Change in Control Agreements with First Financial Executive Officers,” and (iv) appropriate ratification by the board of
directors and compensation committee of the surviving corporation.

Anthony M. Stollings, First Financial’s Chief Banking Officer, has executed an amendment to his current Employment and Non-
Competition Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013. Mr. Stollings will retain his current position with First Financial and such
amendment provides for substantially similar compensation and performance by Mr. Stollings of substantially similar duties. The
amendment provides for severance and change in control benefits similar to those described below under “—Severance and Change
in Control Agreements with First Financial Executive Officers.”

Severance and Change in Control Agreements with First Financial Executive Officers

In connection with the above-referenced offers of employment, First Financial has entered into a Severance and Change in Control
Agreement (we refer to these agreements as CIC Agreements) with each of Mr. Harrod, Ms. Kuhl, Mr. Ringwald, and Mr. Silva.
Each CIC Agreement will become effective only if (i) the merger consummates, and (ii) the individual continues to be employed by
First Financial Bank immediately before consummation of the merger.

The CIC Agreements have an initial term ending on April 30, 2019, subject to automatic successive one-year renewals after the
initial term unless a party to CIC Agreement provides written notice of non-renewal to the other party as specified in the CIC
Agreement. In the event the employee party to the CIC Agreement is terminated by First Financial for a reason other than Cause,
Disability of the employee party, or death of the employee party and such termination is not in connection with a Change in Control
(as each such term is defined in the CIC Agreement), such employee shall be entitled to (i) a severance payment equal to 24 months
base salary, or, in the case of Mr. Harrod and Mr. Silva, 12 months base salary, (ii) a short-term bonus payment equal to the lesser of
(a) two times (or, in the case of Messrs. Harrod and Silva, one times) the executive’s target annual short-term incentive plan bonus,
or (b) two times (or, in the case of Messrs. Harrod and Silva, one times)

the average of the three most recent actual annual bonus awards paid (or payable) to the executive by First Financial or MainSource;
provided, however that for any year in which an executive is not deemed a covered executive (for purposes of Section 162(m) of the
Code), such executive shall be entitled to receive a short term bonus payment equal to two times (or, in the case of Messrs. Harrod
and Silva, one times) the executive’s target annual short-term incentive plan bonus in effect for the year of termination, (iii)
outplacement assistance, and (iv) subject to certain terms and conditions, COBRA coverage. If, immediately prior to a Change in
Control or during the one year period that commences upon a Change in Control, First Financial terminates the employee party for a
reason other than Cause, Disability of the employee party, or death of the employee party, or the employee party resigns from
employment for Good Reason (as such term is defined in the CIC Agreement), then such employee shall be entitled to (i) a
severance payment equal to 24 months base salary, (ii) a short-term bonus payment equal to two times the executive’s target annual
short-term incentive plan bonus in effect for the year of termination, (iii) outplacement assistance, and (iv) subject to certain terms
and conditions, COBRA coverage.

Subject to certain terms and limitations, each CIC Agreement further provides that (i) during the term of the agreement and for a
period of 24 months thereafter (or, in the case of Messrs. Harrod and Silva, 12 months thereafter), the employee party to the CIC
Agreement may not solicit customers of First Financial, (ii) during the term of the agreement and for a period of six months
thereafter, the employee party may not compete with First Financial, and (iii) during the term of the agreement and for a period of
one year thereafter, employee party may not solicit employees of First Financial.

Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

First Financial will continue to provide indemnification and insurance coverage to the directors and executive officers of First
Financial.

Interests of MainSource’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendations of MainSource’s board of directors with respect to the merger, you should be aware that
MainSource’s directors and executive officers have agreements or arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger,
including financial interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other shareholders of MainSource.
MainSource’s board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations of the merits of the merger and in determining
to recommend to MainSource’s shareholders that they vote for the MainSource merger proposal and thereby approve the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. See the sections entitled “The Merger—Background of
the Merger” and “The Merger— MainSource’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of MainSource’s Board of Directors” of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, respectively. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are
quantified in the narrative and table below.

Treatment of MainSource Equity Awards

• Options. At the effective time of the merger, each option granted by MainSource to purchase shares of MainSource
common stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested,
shall, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by First Financial and converted into an
option to purchase from First Financial common shares on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
MainSource options, a number of shares of First Financial common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of MainSource common stock subject to such MainSource stock
option immediately prior to the effective time by (y) the exchange ratio, at a per share exercise price (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per share exercise price for each share of MainSource
common stock subject to such MainSource stock option by (ii) the exchange ratio.

• Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted share of MainSource
common stock will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition deemed satisfied to the extent provided in
the applicable award agreement) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger
consideration, less applicable tax withholdings.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Performance Share Units. Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding performance share unit
award in respect of MainSource common stock will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to
such performance share unit deemed satisfied at target) and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the merger consideration in respect of each share of MainSource common stock underlying such performance
share unit, less applicable tax withholdings.

• Quantification of Payments. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of MainSource’s named
executive officers upon settlement of their options and equity awards, see “—Merger-Related Compensation for
MainSource’s Named Executive Officers” below. The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to MainSource’s
8 non-employee directors upon settlement of their equity awards if the effective time of the merger occurred on October
17, 2017 is $144,596. The amounts specified in this paragraph are determined using a price per share of MainSource
common stock of $35.25, the average closing price per share over the first five business days following the announcement
of the merger agreement.

Existing Change in Control Agreements

MainSource has Change in Control Agreements (which we refer to as the “Existing Change in Control Agreements”) in place with
its current executive officers, specifically Archie M. Brown, Jr., James M. Anderson, Karen B. Woods, and Chris M. Harrison. The
purpose of the Existing Change in Control Agreements is to secure the continued service and dedication of the executives in the
event of an actual or threatened “Change in Control,” as defined in the Existing Change in Control Agreements. The merger is a
Change in Control under the Existing Change in Control Agreements.

Each Existing Change in Control Agreement has a “double trigger” feature which provides that in the event the executive’s
employment is terminated by MainSource other than for “Cause” (as defined in the Agreement) or by the executive for “Good
Reason” (as defined in the Agreement) in connection with or within 12 months of a Change in Control of MainSource, the executive
will be entitled to receive certain specified cash benefits and continuation of medical, dental, accident, disability and life insurance
benefits for the executive and his or her dependents for a period of 12 months following the executive’s date of termination.

As discussed below under “Employment Agreement with Archie M. Brown, Jr.”, Mr. Brown has entered into an employment
agreement with First Financial and the other executive officers of MainSource have entered into severance and change in control
agreements with First Financial. These agreements with First Financial will become effective only if the merger is consummated. If
the merger is consummated and these new agreements with First Financial become effective, the Existing Change in Control
Agreements with MainSource will be terminated and the executive officers will have waived all benefits under these agreements.
The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to MainSource’s current executive officers under the Existing Change in
Control Agreements, if such benefits had not been waived (assuming a closing date of October 17, 2017 and that each executive
officer experienced a qualifying termination at the closing of the merger) is $4,883,892 without taking into account any reduction
which would be required under the Existing Change in Control Agreements to avoid being characterized as an “excess parachute
payment” under section 280G of the Code.

Employment Agreement with Archie M. Brown, Jr.

On July 25, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, First Financial entered into an Employment and Non-Competition
Agreement with Mr. Brown, effective upon consummation of the merger, pursuant to which Mr. Brown will serve as the Chief
Executive Officer and President of each of First Financial and First Financial Bank (the “Brown Employment Agreement”). The
Brown Employment Agreement has an initial term of three years and entitles Mr. Brown to an initial annual base salary of
$776,900. Mr. Brown is also eligible to participate in First Financial’s Annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (with a target incentive
amount equal to 60% of Mr. Brown’s annual base salary) and other employee benefit plans offered generally to First Financial’s
executive officers. Mr. Brown is further eligible to receive long-term incentive awards with a target award opportunity having a
value equal to 110% of annual base salary.

Subject to certain terms and conditions, in the event Mr. Brown terminates his employment for Good Reason or is terminated by
First Financial without Cause (as each such term is defined in the Brown Employment Agreement), he shall be entitled to
outplacement assistance, COBRA coverage, and a lump sum severance

compensation payment equal to (i) two years of base salary plus (ii) the lesser of (x) two and one-half times Mr. Brown’s target
incentive amount under First Financial’s Annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (set at 60% of Mr. Brown’s annual base salary) or (y)
two times the three year average of the actual annual incentive awards paid (or payable) to Mr. Brown by First Financial or
MainSource for the three completed calendar years that immediately precede the termination of employment.

Subject to certain terms and limitations, the Brown Employment Agreement further provides that during the term of the agreement
and for a period of two years thereafter (or 18 months in the case of the non-compete covenant), Mr. Brown may not compete with,
or solicit customers or employees of, First Financial. The Brown Employment Agreement also terminates the Change in Control
Agreement, dated November 14, 2011, between Mr. Brown and MainSource.

Employment Arrangement with James M. Anderson

On September 18, 2017, James M. Anderson, the current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MainSource,
accepted an offer letter from First Financial to become, effective upon the closing of the merger and subject to Mr. Anderson’s
continued employment by MainSource through the effective time of the merger and the ratification of Mr. Anderson’s arrangement
by the Compensation Committee of the surviving corporation following the merger closing, the Chief Financial Officer of the
surviving corporation. Mr. Anderson’s starting salary will be $360,000 annually, and he will participate in the short term incentive
plan and the long term incentive plan of First Financial, as well as other employee benefit plans offered generally to First Financial’s
executive officers. Pursuant to the letter, Mr. Anderson’s annual target under the short term incentive plan will be 50% of his eligible
base compensation, and his target under the long term incentive plan beginning in 2018 will be 50%.

Also on September 18, 2017, Mr. Anderson entered into a Severance and Change in Control Agreement with First Financial (the
“Anderson Severance Agreement”). The Anderson Severance Agreement has a term commencing upon the day immediately
following the effectiveness of the merger and continuing until April 30, 2019, and will renew automatically for successive one-year
periods unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal.

Upon termination of Mr. Anderson without “Cause” (other than as a result of death or disability) and not in connection with a
“Change in Control” (each such term as defined in the Anderson Severance Agreement), Mr. Anderson will be entitled to receive
the following payments and benefits: (i) earned and unpaid base salary and vacation pay through the date of termination; (ii)
continued payment of base salary for 24 months; (iii) an amount equal to a multiple of Mr. Anderson’s target bonus amount under
the short term incentive plan as described below; (iv) outplacement assistance at First Financial’s expense (at a cost of up to 5% of
Mr. Anderson’s base salary); and (v) up to twelve months of the employer portion of the health insurance premium payment
contributions from First Financial. If Mr. Anderson is a covered employee for purposes of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code for the
year in which employment terminates (or would have been a covered employee if Mr. Anderson had continued employment until
the end of the year), the short term incentive plan severance amount payable to Mr. Anderson will be equal to the lesser of (i) two
times the average of the short term incentive plan bonuses earned during the three years prior to the qualifying termination (or such
lesser period for which Mr. Anderson was eligible to participate in the short term incentive plan) or (ii) two times the short term
incentive plan bonus target in effect for the year of termination. If Mr. Anderson is not a covered employee or if a severance benefit
is being paid in connection with a Change in Control, the short term incentive plan severance amount will be two times his target
bonus amount under the short term incentive plan.

If, immediately prior to a Change in Control or during the one-year period that commences upon a Change in Control, First
Financial terminates Mr. Anderson’s employment without Cause (other than for disability or death) or if Mr. Anderson terminates
his employment for “Good Reason,” as defined in the Anderson Severance Agreement, Mr. Anderson will be entitled to receive the
following payments and benefits: (i) earned and unpaid base salary and vacation pay through the date of termination; (ii) continued
payment of base salary for 24 months; (iii) an amount equal to two times his target amount under the Short Term Incentive Plan; (iv)
outplacement assistance at First Financial’s expense (at a cost of up to 5% of Mr. Anderson’s base salary); and (v) up to twelve
months of the employer portion of health insurance premium payment contributions from First Financial.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Anderson Severance Agreement also provides that during his employment with First Financial and for six months thereafter,
Mr. Anderson must not compete with First Financial, and for two years after termination, Mr. Anderson must not solicit customers
or employees of First Financial.

If and when the Anderson Severance Agreement becomes effective, the Existing Change in Control Agreement between
MainSource and Mr. Anderson will be terminated and Mr. Anderson will have waived all benefits thereunder.

Offers of Employment to Other MainSource Executive Officers

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, First Financial delivered standard offers of employment to certain other MainSource
executive officers, including Karen B. Woods, the Executive Vice President, Corporate Counsel, and Chief Risk Officer of
MainSource, and Chris M. Harrison, the Chief Consumer Banking Officer of MainSource, which have been accepted by Ms. Woods
and Mr. Harrison. These offers of employment provide for a base salary, target annual incentive compensation and standard benefits.
Each of the above-referenced offers of employment is conditioned upon (i) closing of the merger, (ii) continued employment by the
offeree through the effective time of the merger, (iii) execution of the below-referenced Severance and Change in Control
Agreements, and (iv) appropriate ratification by the board of directors and compensation committee of the surviving corporation.

Change in Control Agreements with MainSource Executive Officers

MainSource is currently a party to an Existing Change in Control Agreement with Karen B. Woods and Chris M. Harrison. In
connection with the above-referenced offers of employment, First Financial entered into a Severance and Change in Control
Agreement (which, similar to the identical agreements offered to First Financial executive officers, we refer to as CIC Agreements)
with Ms. Woods and Mr. Harrison. Each CIC Agreement will become effective only if (i) the merger consummates, and (ii) the
individual continues to be employed by MainSource Bank immediately before consummation of the merger. Pursuant to such
agreements, if and when the CIC Agreements become effective, the Existing Change in Control Agreements between MainSource
and the executive officers will be terminated and the executive officers will have waived all benefits thereunder.

The CIC Agreements have an initial term ending on April 30, 2019, subject to automatic successive one-year renewals after the
initial term unless a party to CIC Agreement provides written notice of non-renewal to the other party as specified in the CIC
Agreement. In the event the employee party to the CIC Agreement is terminated by First Financial for a reason other than Cause,
Disability of the employee party, or death of the employee party and such termination is not in connection with a Change in Control
(as each such term is defined in the CIC Agreement), such employee shall be entitled to (i) a severance payment equal to 24 months
base salary, (ii) a short-term bonus payment equal to the lesser of (a) two times the executive’s target annual short-term incentive
plan bonus, or (b) two times the average of the three most recent actual annual bonus awards paid (or payable) to the executive by
First Financial or MainSource; provided, however that for any year in which an executive is not deemed a covered executive (for
purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code), such executive shall be entitled to receive a short term bonus payment equal to two times
the executive’s target annual short-term incentive plan bonus in effect for the year of termination, (iii) outplacement assistance, and
(iv) subject to certain terms and conditions, COBRA coverage. If, immediately prior to a Change in Control or during the one year
period that commences upon a Change in Control, First Financial terminates the employee party for a reason other than Cause,
Disability of the employee party, or death of the employee party, or the employee party resigns from employment for Good Reason
(as such term is defined in the CIC Agreement), then such employee shall be entitled to (i) a severance payment equal to 24 months
base salary, (ii) a short-term bonus payment equal to two times the executive’s target annual short-term incentive plan bonus in
effect for the year of termination, (iii) outplacement assistance, and (iv) subject to certain terms and conditions, COBRA coverage.

Subject to certain terms and limitations, each CIC Agreement further provides that (i) during the term of the agreement and for a
period of 24 months thereafter, the employee party to the CIC Agreement may not solicit customers of First Financial, (ii) during the
term of the agreement and for a period of six months thereafter, the employee party may not compete with First Financial, and (iii)
during the term of the agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, employee party may not solicit employees of First
Financial.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Other Compensation Matters

All of MainSource’s executive officers are participants in the MainSource Short Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the
STIP). In the event of a change in control, the STIP provides that participants may receive an incentive compensation payment
based upon actual performance (measured immediately prior to the change in control) compared to the performance measures
prorated to reflect the period prior to the change in control. Such awards will be paid in a single sum, in cash, on or before the
effective date of the change in control. The merger is a change in control under the STIP. For an estimate of the value of the prorated
incentive compensation payable to each of the named executive officers in connection with the merger, see “—Merger-Related
Compensation for MainSource’s Named Executive Officers.”

Merger-Related Compensation for MainSource’s Named Executive Officers

This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each of
MainSource’s named executive officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. The merger-related compensation
payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of MainSource’s shareholders, as described above in
“MainSource Proposals—Proposal No. 2: MainSource Compensation Proposal.”

The tables below set forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of MainSource’s named executive officers would receive
in connection with the merger, assuming that the merger were consummated and each such named executive officer remained
employed by the merged company after the merger was consummated. The amounts below are determined using a price per share of
MainSource common stock of $35.25, the average closing price per share over the first five business days following the
announcement of the merger agreement, and are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate
on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table. The amounts below do not reflect
compensation actions that may occur after the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus but before the effective time of the
merger. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a MainSource named executive
officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

(3) Mr. Brown has entered into the Brown Employment Agreement, and Messrs. Anderson and Harrison have each entered in to a Severance and Change in
Control Agreement with First Financial. These agreements with First Financial will become effective only if the merger is consummated, and in the case of the
Severance and Change in Control Agreements, if Messrs. Anderson and Harrison remain employed by MainSource Bank immediately prior to the merger. If
the merger is consummated and these new agreements with First Financial become effective, the Existing Change in Control Agreements with MainSource will
be terminated and the executive officers will have waived all benefits under these agreements. The only merger-related compensation Messrs. Brown,
Anderson, Goodwin, and Harrison will receive in connection with the merger is (i) a lump sum cash payment under the STIP (except for Mr. Goodwin), and
(ii) the vesting of previously awarded restricted stock awards, performance share units (excluding Mr. Goodwin), and stock options, under 2007 Stock
Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the “2007 Plan”) and MainSource Financial Group, Inc., 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the “2015

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

The merger agreement provides that after the effective time of the merger, First Financial and the surviving corporation will
indemnify and hold harmless all present and former directors, officers, and employees of MainSource and its subsidiaries against
any costs or liabilities arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, or employee of MainSource or any of its
subsidiaries and pertaining to matters, acts, or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and will also advance expenses to such persons to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, provided that such person provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification.

Subject to certain limitations, the merger agreement also requires the surviving corporation to maintain, for a period of six years
after the completion of the merger, MainSource’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, or policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured, with respect to claims against present and former officers and directors of MainSource and its
subsidiaries arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the effective time of the merger. First Financial will not,
however, be required to spend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
MainSource under its current policy. In lieu of the foregoing, MainSource, in consultation with First Financial, may obtain at or
prior to the effective time a six-year prepaid “tail” policy under MainSource’s existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence, if such policy can be obtained at an aggregate price of no
more than the cap described in the preceding sentence. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement
—Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance” of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Board of Directors of First Financial and First Financial Bank Following the Merger

Pursuant to the merger agreement, First Financial has agreed to cause the number of directors that will comprise the board of
directors of First Financial effective as of the effective time of the merger to be 15. Effective as of the effective time of the merger,
the board of directors of First Financial shall consist of nine current members of the First Financial board of directors (the “First
Financial Continuing Directors”) and six current members of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MainSource board of directors (the “MainSource Continuing Directors”). The First Financial Continuing Directors and the
MainSource Continuing Directors shall be mutually agreed upon by the chairperson of the board of directors and Chief Executive
Officer of First Financial and the lead director and Chief Executive Officer of MainSource. Such continuing directors have not yet
been identified.

First Financial’s Dividend Policy

Subject to the approval of the board of directors of the surviving corporation, following the completion of the merger, each of First
Financial and MainSource intend to maintain First Financial’s quarterly dividend and expect to continue to increase it over time.
However, the First Financial board may change its dividend policy at any time, and no assurances can be given that dividends will
continue to be paid by First Financial or the surviving corporation or that dividends, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in
future periods because any such dividend would be dependent upon First Financial’s or the surviving corporation’s future earnings,
capital requirements, and financial condition. In addition, the payment of dividends by financial holding companies is generally
subject to legal and regulatory limitations. For further information, see “Comparative Market Prices and Dividends.”

Public Trading Markets

First Financial common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ under the symbol “FFBC,” and MainSource common stock is listed
on NASDAQ under the symbol “MSFG.” Upon completion of the merger, MainSource common stock will no longer be quoted on
NASDAQ. Following the merger, shares of First Financial common stock will continue to be traded on NASDAQ.

Under the merger agreement, First Financial will cause the shares of First Financial common stock to be issued in the merger,
including with respect to MainSource restricted stock and MainSource restricted stock units, to be approved for listing on
NASDAQ, subject to notice of issuance, and the merger agreement provides that neither First Financial nor MainSource will be
required to complete the merger if such shares are not authorized for listing on NASDAQ subject to notice of issuance.

Dissenters’ Rights in the Merger

Under Section 23-1-44-8 of the IBCL, the holders of MainSource common stock will not be entitled to dissenters’ rights in
connection with the merger if, on the record date for the MainSource special meeting, their shares are listed on a national securities
exchange. MainSource common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to
be so listed on the record date for the MainSource special meeting. Accordingly, holders of MainSource common stock will not be
entitled to any dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of all approvals and consents required to complete the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement from (i) the Federal Reserve Board under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”) and
the Bank Merger Act, (ii) the ODFI, and (iii) any other regulatory approval the failure of which to obtain would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the surviving corporation (which First Financial and MainSource currently expect to
be none), and the expiration of any applicable statutory waiting periods, in each case, without the imposition of a condition or
requirement that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, First Financial and
MainSource have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts and cooperate to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to obtain as promptly as practicable all regulatory approvals necessary or advisable to complete the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such approvals. First Financial and MainSource have filed
applications and notifications to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

Federal Reserve Board

The application is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board under section 3 of the BHC Act and the Bank Merger Act.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In considering an application under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the
following factors: (1) the effect of the proposal on competition; (2) the financial and managerial resources and the effect of the
proposed merger on these resources); (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the records of performance
of the institutions under the Community Reinvestment Act; and (4) conformity to applicable law.

Under the Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for the merger of MainSource Bank with and
into First Financial Bank. In reviewing applications under the Bank Merger Act, the Federal Reserve Board must consider a number
of factors, including: (1) the effect of a proposed merger on competition; (2) financial and managerial resources and future
prospects; (3) convenience and needs of the communities to be served; (4) the effectiveness of both institutions in combating money
laundering; and (5) the risk to stability of the U.S. banking and financial system. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board considers
the capital level of the resulting bank, the conformity of the transaction to applicable law, the purpose of the merger, the impact of
the merger on the safety and soundness of the bank, and the effect on the bank’s or savings association’s stockholders, depositors,
other creditors and customers. Finally, the Federal Reserve Board will evaluate the merger application under the CRA and will
consider the performance of the institutions in helping to meet the credit needs of the relevant communities, including low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

Merger transactions approved under the Bank Merger Act generally may not be completed until 30 days after the approval of the
applicable federal agency is received, during which time the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) may challenge the transaction on
antitrust grounds. With the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the concurrence of the DOJ, the waiting period may be
reduced to no less than 15 days. The commencement of an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of such an approval unless a
court specifically ordered otherwise. In reviewing the proposed transaction, the DOJ could analyze the proposed transaction’s effect
on competition differently than the Federal Reserve Board , and thus it is possible that the DOJ could reach a different conclusion
than the Federal Reserve Board regarding the proposed transaction’s effects on competition. A determination by the DOJ not to
object to the proposed transaction may not prevent the filing of antitrust actions by private persons or state attorneys general.

Notice of these applications must be published. The Federal Reserve Board takes into account the views of third party commenters,
particularly on the subject of the acquirer and target’s service to their respective communities, and any hearing, meeting or
comments provided by third parties could prolong the period during which the notice is under review by the Federal Reserve Board.

Ohio Division of Financial Institutions

In reviewing bank merger applications, the superintendent of ODFI will consider the following factors: (1) whether the transaction
would result in a monopoly or would further any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business
of banking in any part of the state and any markets served by the resulting or surviving bank; (2) whether the effect of the proposed
transaction in any part of the state and any markets served by the resulting or surviving bank may be to substantially lessen
competition, tend to create a monopoly, or in any other manner restrain trade, unless the superintendent finds the anticompetitive
effects of the transaction would clearly be outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the
convenience and needs of the community to be served; (3) the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the banks
involved; (4) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; (5) whether, upon completion of the transaction, the
resulting or surviving state bank will meet the Ohio statutory requirements applicable to financial institutions; and (6) the comments
of any regulatory authority notified of the merger.

Additional Regulatory Approvals and Notices

In addition, notifications and/or applications requesting approval may be submitted to various other federal and state regulatory
authorities and self-regulatory organizations, including certain state insurance departments.

Based on information available to us as of the date hereof, First Financial and MainSource believe that the merger does not raise
substantial antitrust or other significant regulatory concerns and that we will be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals.
However, neither First Financial nor MainSource can assure you that all of the regulatory approvals described above will be
obtained and, if obtained, we cannot assure you as to the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

timing of any such approvals, our ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms, or the absence of any litigation challenging
such approvals. In addition, there can be no assurance that such approvals will not impose conditions or requirements that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, assets, or business of the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger. There can likewise be no assurances
that U.S. federal or state regulatory authorities will not attempt to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds or for other reasons, or
if such a challenge is made, as to the result of such challenge.

Neither First Financial nor MainSource is aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required for completion
of the merger other than those described above. It is presently contemplated that if any such additional governmental approvals or
actions are required, those approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or
actions will be obtained.

The processing time for obtaining regulatory approvals for bank mergers, particularly for larger institutions, has increased since the
financial crisis. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act requires bank regulators to consider financial stability concerns when evaluating a
proposed bank merger.

In a recent approval order, the Federal Reserve Board stated that it expects that a banking organization will resolve all material
weaknesses identified by examiners before applying to engage in expansionary activity. The Federal Reserve Board stated that, in
the future, if issues arise during processing of an application, the Federal Reserve Board expects that a banking organization will
withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns. Accordingly, if there is an adverse development in either
party’s regulatory standing, First Financial may be required to withdraw some or all of the applications for approval of the proposed
mergers and, if possible, resubmit it after the applicable supervisory concerns have been resolved.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following describes certain aspects of the merger, including certain material provisions of the merger agreement. The following
description of the merger agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the merger agreement, which is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document governing
the merger.

Structure of the Merger

Each of First Financial’s and MainSource’s respective boards of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The
merger agreement provides for the merger of MainSource with and into First Financial, with First Financial continuing as the
surviving corporation. Following the completion of the merger, MainSource Bank, an Indiana state chartered bank and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of MainSource, will merge with and into First Financial Bank, an Ohio state chartered bank and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of First Financial, with First Financial Bank continuing as the surviving entity.

Before the completion of the merger, First Financial and MainSource may, by mutual agreement, change the method or structure of
effecting the combination of First Financial and MainSource, to the extent that First Financial and MainSource both decide that such
change is necessary, appropriate, or desirable, except that no such change may (1) alter or change the exchange ratio or the number
of shares of First Financial common stock received by MainSource shareholders in exchange for each share of MainSource common
stock, (2) adversely affect the tax treatment of First Financial’s shareholders or MainSource’s shareholders, (3) adversely affect the
tax treatment of First Financial or MainSource, or (4) materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement in a timely manner. The merger agreement further provides that if either MainSource or First
Financial fails to obtain the required vote of its shareholders to adopt the merger agreement, each of the parties will in good faith use
its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction (provided that neither party will have any obligation to alter
or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued MainSource shareholders as provided
for in the merger agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit the merger agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated thereby (or as restructured) to its respective shareholders for adoption.

Merger Consideration

Each share of MainSource common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock, except for shares of MainSource common stock
owned by MainSource as treasury stock or owned by MainSource or First Financial or a subsidiary of either (in each case other than
in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted).

If the number of outstanding shares of First Financial common stock or MainSource common stock is increased, decreased, changed
into, or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there is any extraordinary
dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment will be made to the exchange ratio.

Fractional Shares

First Financial will not issue any fractional shares of First Financial common stock in the merger. Instead, a MainSource shareholder
who otherwise would have received a fraction of a share of First Financial common stock will receive an amount in cash rounded to
the nearest whole cent. This cash amount will be determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices of First
Financial common stock for the twenty consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the closing date of the
merger by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of First Financial common
stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

Governing Documents; Directors and Officers; Governance Matters; Headquarters

At the effective time of the merger, the First Financial articles of incorporation and regulations in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be the articles of incorporation and regulations of the surviving corporation after completion of the
merger until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also at the effective time, the number of directors on the First Financial board of directors will be increased to 15 and six then-
former MainSource directors will join nine First Financial directors to form the board of directors of the combined company. At the
effective time, the number of directors on the board of directors of First Financial Bank will also be increased to 15, constituted in
the same manner and with the same individuals as the board of directors of First Financial.

At the effective time of the merger, Claude E. Davis will serve as Executive Chairman and Archie M. Brown, Jr., will serve as
President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company.

At the effective time of the merger, the location of the headquarters and principal executive offices of First Financial will be
Cincinnati, Ohio.

Treatment of MainSource Equity-Based Awards

Options. At the effective time of the merger, each option granted by MainSource to purchase shares of MainSource common stock
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, shall without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by First Financial and converted into an option to purchase from First Financial
common shares on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such MainSource options, a number of shares of First
Financial common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of
MainSource common stock subject to such MainSource stock option immediately prior to the effective time by (y) the exchange
ratio, at a per share exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per share
exercise price for each share of MainSource common stock subject to such MainSource stock option by (ii) the exchange ratio.

Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted share of MainSource common
stock will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition deemed satisfied to the extent provided in the applicable award
agreement) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration, less applicable tax
withholdings.

Performance Share Units. Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding performance share unit award in
respect of MainSource common stock will fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to such performance
share unit deemed satisfied at target) and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger
consideration in respect of each share of MainSource common stock underlying such performance share unit, less applicable tax
withholdings.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The merger will be completed only if all conditions to the merger discussed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and set forth in
the merger agreement are either satisfied or waived. Please see “—Conditions to Complete the Merger” beginning on page 99.

The merger will become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio
and the articles of merger filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
the merger will occur at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time on a date no later than seven calendar days after the satisfaction or waiver
of the last to occur of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. It
currently is anticipated that the completion of the merger will occur in early 2018 subject to the receipt of shareholder and
regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, but neither First Financial nor MainSource can guarantee when or if
the merger will be completed.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates

The conversion of MainSource common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the
effective time of the merger. After completion of the merger, the exchange agent will exchange certificates representing shares of
MainSource common stock for the merger consideration to be received pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. Shares of
MainSource common stock held in book-entry form automatically will be exchanged for book-entry shares of First Financial

TABLE OF CONTENTS

effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender shares of MainSource common stock in
exchange for the merger consideration the holder is entitled to receive under the merger agreement.

If a certificate for MainSource common stock has been lost, stolen, or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the merger
consideration upon receipt of (1) an affidavit of that fact by the claimant and (2) if required by First Financial, the posting of a bond
in an amount as First Financial may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such certificate.

After completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of MainSource of shares of
MainSource common stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.

Withholding

First Financial and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares, dividends,
or distributions payable, or any other consideration payable under the merger agreement to any MainSource shareholder the
amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign tax law. If any such
amounts are withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the
merger agreement as having been paid to the shareholders from whom they were withheld.

Dividends and Distributions

No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to First Financial common stock will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificates of MainSource common stock until the holder surrenders such certificate in accordance with the merger
agreement. After the surrender of a certificate in accordance with the merger agreement, the record holder thereof will be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest, which had previously become payable with respect to the
whole shares of First Financial common stock that the shares of MainSource common stock represented by such certificate have
been converted into the right to receive under the merger agreement.

Representations and Warranties

The representations, warranties, and covenants described below and included in the merger agreement were made only for purposes
of the merger agreement and as of specific dates, may be subject to limitations, qualifications, or exceptions agreed upon by the

between First Financial and MainSource rather than establishing matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality that
differ from those standards relevant to investors. You should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, or any
description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of First Financial, MainSource, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties, and
covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in
public disclosures by First Financial or MainSource. The representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger
agreement should not be read alone but, instead, should be read only in conjunction with the information provided elsewhere in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please

respective businesses. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time of the merger.

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by each of MainSource and First Financial relating to a number
of matters, including the following:

announcement of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby on relationships with
customers or employees (including the loss of personnel subsequent to the date of the merger agreement); except, with respect to

properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations, or financial condition of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as
compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and its subsidiaries operate), or (ii) the ability of such party to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

Covenants and Agreements

First Financial and MainSource have agreed that, prior to the effective time of the merger (or earlier termination of the merger
agreement), subject to specified exceptions, they will, and will cause each of their respective subsidiaries to, (a) conduct their
respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects, and (b) use reasonable best efforts
to maintain and preserve intact their respective business organizations, employees, and advantageous business relationships. In
addition, each of MainSource and First Financial has agreed that, during the same period, subject to specified exceptions, it will, and
will cause each of its subsidiaries to, take no action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or delay the ability of
either First Financial or MainSource to obtain any necessary approvals of any governmental entity or regulatory agency required for
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or to perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement, or
to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby on a timely basis.

Additionally, MainSource and First Financial have undertaken further covenants. Prior to the effective time of the merger (or earlier
termination of the merger agreement), subject to specified exceptions, neither MainSource nor First Financial may, and neither
MainSource nor First Financial may permit any of its subsidiaries to, without prior written consent of the other party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), undertake the following:

capital stock (except (A)(i) regular quarterly cash dividends by MainSource in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice at a dividend payout ratio between 30% and 40%, and (ii) regular quarterly cash dividends by First
Financial in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (B) dividends paid by any of the subsidiaries of
either party to such party or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or (C) the acceptance of shares of either party’s

stock options or equity awards, in each case, in accordance with past practice and the terms of the applicable award
agreements);

• other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, grant any stock options, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, restricted stock units, restricted shares, or other equity-based awards or interests, or grant any
individual, corporation, or other entity any right to acquire any shares of its capital stock;

accordance with their terms;

• agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of its board of directors or similar governing body in
support of, any of the actions prohibited by the merger agreement.

Regulatory Matters

First Financial and MainSource have agreed to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and
file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions, and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of all such government entities. However, in no event will First Financial or
MainSource be required to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the required permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger.
First Financial and MainSource have also agreed to furnish each other with all information reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any statement, filing, notice, or application to any governmental entity in connection with the merger, as well as to
promptly keep each other apprised of the status of matters related to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Employee Benefit Matters

First Financial has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to provide each MainSource continuing employee for so long as such
employee is employed, following the effective time, with employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of First Financial and its subsidiaries; provided that First Financial may
satisfy this obligation by providing such continuing employees with employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to the employee benefits provided by MainSource or its subsidiaries to such continuing employees immediately prior to the effective
time. Except for any MainSource employee who has or is a party to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in
control agreement, or any other agreement that may be triggered by the merger or the bank merger, those employees of MainSource
or any subsidiary as of the effective time whom First Financial or its subsidiaries elect not to employ after the effective time as a
result of the merger, who are employed and then terminated as a result of the merger within six (6) months subsequent to the
conversion of the operating system of MainSource Bank into First Financial Bank (including through an involuntary termination),

TABLE OF CONTENTS

or those employees who voluntarily resign employment due to an involuntary relocation of the employee’s principal place of
employment to a location which is more than twenty-five (25) miles from the employee’s principal place of employment
immediately prior to the effective time and who would have been considered eligible for a payment under First Financial’s
applicable severance plan shall be entitled to severance benefits equal to two (2) weeks of annual base pay for each year of service
(including years of service with MainSource and/or any of its subsidiaries) with a minimum of four (4) weeks of annual base pay
and a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of annual base pay.

Following the effective time of the merger, subject to certain customary exclusions, First Financial will or will cause the surviving
corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions, and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements under any employee benefit plans of First Financial or its subsidiaries in which
any MainSource continuing employees are eligible to participate after the effective time of the merger (“new plans”), except to the
extent they would apply under the analogous MainSource benefit plans, (ii) provide credit for any eligible expenses incurred prior to
the effective time of the merger under a MainSource benefit plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous
MainSource benefit plan prior to the effective time of the merger) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, or out-of-
pocket requirements under any new plans, and (iii) recognize all service of MainSource continuing employees for all purposes in
any new plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous MainSource benefit plan prior to the
effective time of the merger. First Financial also will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, assume and honor all MainSource
benefits which are vested upon consummation of the merger.

At least 90 business days prior to the effective time of the merger, First Financial may request that MainSource terminate the
MainSource Plan effective as of the day immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and contingent upon the occurrence of
the closing under the merger agreement. In this event, MainSource continuing employees will be eligible to participate, effective as
of the effective time of the merger, in the First Financial Savings Plan, and will be permitted to make rollover contributions to the
First Financial Savings Plan.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

The merger agreement provides that following completion of the merger, First Financial and the surviving corporation each will
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all present and former directors, officers, and
employees of MainSource and its subsidiaries (in their capacity as such) against any costs and liabilities, whether arising before or
after the effective time of the merger, arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, or
employee of MainSource or its subsidiaries, and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
merger, and will also advance expenses to such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, provided that such person
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

The merger agreement requires the surviving corporation to maintain, for a period of six years after completion of the merger,
MainSource’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, or policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured, with respect
to claims against present and former officers and directors of MainSource and its subsidiaries arising from facts or events that
occurred at or prior to the completion of the merger. However, the surviving corporation is not required to spend annually more than
300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date of the merger agreement by MainSource for such insurance (which we refer
to as the “premium cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed that amount, then the surviving
corporation will maintain policies of insurance which, in its good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, MainSource, in consultation with First Financial, may (and,
at First Financial’s request, will use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the effective time of the merger a six-year
“tail” policy under MainSource’s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence if such a policy can be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the premium cap. If
MainSource purchases such a “tail” policy, First Financial or the surviving corporation must maintain the policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations under the policy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Dividends

First Financial and MainSource must coordinate with the other for the declaration of any dividends in respect of First Financial
common stock and MainSource common stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto to ensure that MainSource
shareholders do not fail to receive one dividend (or receive two dividends) in any quarter.

Corporate Governance

First Financial shall take all actions necessary to cause the size of the board of directors of the surviving corporation to be 15
directors, effective as of the effective time. Effective as of the effective time, the board of directors of the surviving corporation shall
consist of nine current members of the First Financial board of directors and six current members of the MainSource board of
directors. The First Financial continuing directors and the MainSource continuing directors shall be mutually agreed upon by the
chairperson of the board of directors and chief executive officer of First Financial and the lead director and chief executive officer of
MainSource. The First Financial continuing directors and the MainSource continuing directors shall continue in office and shall
serve on the board of directors of the surviving corporation until such time as their successors are duly elected and qualified. The
board of directors of the surviving corporation (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall cause the First Financial continuing
directors and the MainSource continuing directors to be nominated for election at the first annual meeting of shareholders of the
surviving corporation following the effective time.

Civic Commitment

The merger agreement requires the surviving corporation to contribute not less than $1 million over five years to the greater
Greensburg, Indiana community.

Certain Additional Covenants

The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, obtaining required consents, the listing of the shares of First Financial common stock to be issued in the
merger, access to information, exemption from takeover laws, public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, and First Financial’s assumption of MainSource’s obligations in respect of its outstanding debt,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.

Shareholder Meetings and Recommendation of MainSource’s and First Financial’s Boards of Directors

Each of MainSource and First Financial has agreed to hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of voting upon adoption of
the merger agreement as soon as reasonably practicable and upon other related matters. The board of directors of each of
MainSource and First Financial has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the vote required to
adopt the merger agreement, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in this joint proxy statement/prospectus) that they adopt and approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. However, if the board of directors of MainSource or First Financial, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to continue to recommend the merger agreement, then it may (but shall not be required to) submit the merger agreement to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving the merger agreement may not be rescinded or amended)
and may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or a
supplemental amendment thereto to the extent required by law, provided that (1) it gives the other party at least seven calendar days’
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by MainSource’s board in response to an acquisition
proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third-party in any such acquisition proposal, or any
amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances); and (2) at the end of such
notice period, the board of directors takes into account any amendment or modification to the merger agreement proposed by the
other party and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, determines in good faith that it nevertheless would be reasonably
likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend the merger agreement. Any
material amendment to any acquisition proposal will require a new notice period.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding any change in recommendation by the board of directors of MainSource or First Financial, unless the merger
agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each party is required to convene a meeting of its shareholders and to
submit the merger agreement to a vote of such shareholders. First Financial and MainSource shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate to hold the MainSource special meeting and the First Financial special meeting on the same day and at the same time as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement and to set the same record date for each such meeting. First
Financial and MainSource must adjourn or postpone such meeting if there are insufficient shares of First Financial common stock or
MainSource common stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting MainSource or First Financial, as applicable, has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary for adoption of the merger agreement.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers

MainSource has agreed that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors, and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any acquisition proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations
with any person concerning any acquisition proposal, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or
participate in any discussions with, any person relating to, any acquisition proposal except to notify a person that has made or, to the
knowledge of MainSource, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an acquisition proposal, of the
existence of MainSource’s obligations with respect to such acquisition proposals under the merger agreement. For purposes of the
merger agreement, an “acquisition proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer,
proposal, or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its subsidiaries, or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a
party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of
MainSource, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third-
party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of MainSource or its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of MainSource, or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or other similar transaction
involving MainSource or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of MainSource.

However, in the event that prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by MainSource’s shareholders, MainSource receives an
unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal, it may, and may permit its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors,
agents, advisors, and representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its board of directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that, prior to providing any such nonpublic information,
MainSource enters into a confidentiality agreement with such third-party on terms no less favorable to it than the confidentiality
agreement between First Financial and MainSource, and which confidentiality agreement does not provide such person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with MainSource. MainSource will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to, cause its and its
subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, advisors, and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions, or negotiations conducted before the date of the merger agreement with any person other than First Financial with
respect to any acquisition proposal. MainSource will promptly (within 24 hours) advise First Financial following receipt of any
acquisition proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, and the substance thereof
(including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or acquisition proposal and a copy thereof
if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence), and will keep First Financial apprised of any related developments,
discussions, and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or
acquisition proposal. In addition, MainSource has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or
standstill agreements to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Conditions to Complete the Merger

First Financial’s and MainSource’s respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
following conditions:

• the adoption of the merger agreement by First Financial’s shareholders and by MainSource’s shareholders;

• the authorization for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, of the First Financial common stock to be
issued upon the consummation of the merger;

• the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals contemplated by the merger agreement, except for those the failure of which
to be obtained would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
combined company, and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, without the imposition of any
condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger;

• the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part with respect to the
First Financial common stock to be issued upon the consummation of the merger, and the absence of any stop order (or
proceedings for that purpose initiated or threatened and not withdrawn);

• the absence of any order, injunction, or decree by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition preventing the completion of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction, or decree enacted, entered, promulgated, or enforced by any
governmental entity which prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the merger;

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement as of the date on
which the merger agreement was entered into and as of the date on which the merger is completed, subject to the
materiality standards provided in the merger agreement (and the receipt by each party of an officer’s certificate from the
other party to such effect);

• the performance by the other party in all material respects of all obligations required to be performed by it under the
merger agreement at or prior to the date on which the merger is completed (and the receipt by each party of an officer’s
certificate from the other party to such effect); and

• receipt by such party of an opinion of legal counsel to the effect that on the basis of facts, representations, and assumptions
set forth or referred to in such opinion, the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

Neither MainSource nor First Financial can provide assurance as to when or if all of the conditions to the merger can or will be
satisfied or waived by the appropriate party. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, neither MainSource nor First
Financial has reason to believe that any of these conditions will not be satisfied.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to completion of the merger in the following circumstances:

• by mutual written consent of First Financial and MainSource, if the board of directors of each so determines by a vote of a
majority of the members of its entire board;

• by either First Financial or MainSource, if any governmental entity that must grant a requisite regulatory approval has
denied approval of the merger or the bank merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable, or any
governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting, or making illegal, the consummation of the merger or the bank merger, unless the failure to obtain a requisite
regulatory approval is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe its
covenants and agreements under the merger agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• by either First Financial or MainSource, if the merger has not been completed on or before October 31, 2018, unless the
failure of the merger to be consummated by that date is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger
agreement to perform or observe its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement;

• by either the board of directors of First Financial or the board of directors of MainSource (provided that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained in the merger
agreement), if there is a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in the merger agreement on the part of the other party
which, either individually or in the aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the date the merger is
completed, the failure of a closing condition of the terminating party and which is not cured within 45 days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such
fewer days as remain prior to October 31, 2018);

• by First Financial, if (i) the board of directors of MainSource shall have (a) failed to recommend in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus that the shareholders of MainSource adopt the merger agreement, or withdrawn, modified or
qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to First Financial, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within three calendar days after First Financial requests in writing that such action be taken, or failed to
recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding MainSource common stock that has
been publicly disclosed (other than by First Financial or an affiliate of First Financial) within 10 business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms of the merger
agreement, or (b) recommended or endorsed an acquisition proposal, or (ii) MainSource or its board of directors has
breached its obligations with respect to the MainSource’s shareholder approvals or any acquisition proposal required by
the merger agreement in any material respect (we refer to any actions taken by the MainSource board of directors under
clauses (i) or (ii) of this paragraph as a “MainSource board of directors change of recommendation”);

• by MainSource, if (i) the board of directors of First Financial shall have failed to recommend in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus that the shareholders of First Financial adopt the merger agreement, or withdrawn, modified or
qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to MainSource, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within three calendar days after MainSource requests in writing that such action be taken, or (ii) First
Financial or its board of directors has breached its obligations with respect to the First Financial shareholder approvals
required by the merger agreement in any material respect; or

• by MainSource, in the event that (i) the volume-weighted average price of shares of First Financial common stock quoted
on NASDAQ for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the Determination Date (as defined below) (the “First
Financial Average Closing Price”) is less than $22.18 per share and (ii) the First Financial Average Closing Price for such
period underperforms the KBW Regional Banking Index by greater than 20%. If MainSource exercises its termination
right described in the preceding sentence, First Financial will have the option to keep the merger agreement in full force
and effect by increasing the exchange ratio to adjust for such decrease in market value. The merger agreement defines
“Determination Date” as the latest of (i) the date on which all regulatory approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary
for consummation of the merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period); or (ii) the date on which the
shareholder approvals of both MainSource and First Financial have been received.

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and have no effect, except that (1) both First Financial and MainSource
will remain liable for any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of the merger
agreement (which, for MainSource, includes loss of economic benefits of the merger, including the loss of the premium for
MainSource shareholders and holders of MainSource equity awards) and (2) designated provisions of the merger agreement will
survive the termination, including those relating to payment of the termination fee and the confidential treatment of information.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Termination Fee

MainSource will pay First Financial a termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated in the following circumstances:

• In the event that after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the termination of the merger agreement, a bona fide
acquisition proposal has been made known to senior management of MainSource or has been made directly to its
shareholders generally, or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an acquisition proposal with
respect to MainSource and (A) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated by either First Financial or MainSource
because the merger has not been completed prior to October 31, 2018, and MainSource has failed to obtain the required
vote of its shareholders at the duly convened special meeting of MainSource’s shareholders or any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement is taken or (B) thereafter the merger
agreement is terminated by First Financial as a result of a breach of the merger agreement by MainSource that would
constitute the failure of a closing condition and that has not been cured during the permitted time period, or by its nature
cannot be cured during such period, and (C) prior to the date that is twelve months after the date of such termination,
MainSource enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal
(whether or not the same acquisition proposal as that referred to above), then MainSource will, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay First Financial, by wire
transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $40 million (the “termination fee”) (provided that for purposes of the foregoing,
all references in the definition of acquisition proposal to “20%” will instead refer to “50%”).

• MainSource will pay First Financial by wire transfer of same day funds the termination fee in the event that First Financial
terminates the agreement because of a MainSource board of directors change of recommendation.

Expenses and Fees

All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by
the party incurring such expense, except that the costs and expenses of printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the merger will be borne equally by First Financial and MainSource.

Amendment, Waiver, and Extension of the Merger Agreement

Subject to compliance with applicable law, the merger agreement may be amended by the respective boards of directors of First
Financial and MainSource at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the merger by the
shareholders of First Financial and MainSource, except that after adoption of the merger agreement by the respective shareholders
of First Financial or MainSource, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of the merger
agreement that requires further approval under applicable law.

At any time prior to the completion of the merger, the respective boards of directors of First Financial and MainSource may, to the
extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the
merger agreement, and waive compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained in the merger
agreement, except that after adoption of the merger agreement by the respective shareholders of First Financial or MainSource, there
may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of the merger agreement or any portion thereof
that requires further approval under applicable law.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

The accounting principles applicable to this transaction as described in FASB ASC 805 provide transactions that represent business
combinations are to be accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquisition method requires all of the following steps: (a)
identifying the acquirer; (b) determining the acquisition date; (c) recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; and (d) recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a
bargain purchase.

The appropriate accounting treatment for this transaction is as a business combination under the acquisition method, as defined by
ASC 805. The results of operations for the combined company will be reported prospectively subsequent to the acquisition date.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of
MainSource common stock that exchange their shares of MainSource common stock for shares of First Financial common stock in
the merger. The following discussion is based upon the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial
and administrative authorities, rulings, and decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These
authorities may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, or foreign jurisdiction, or under any U.S. federal laws other than those
pertaining to the income tax.

The following discussion applies only to holders of MainSource common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider
all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances and does not
apply to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as, for example, dealers or brokers in
securities, commodities, or foreign currencies; traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting; banks
and certain other financial institutions; insurance companies; mutual funds; tax-exempt organizations; holders subject to the
alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code; partnerships; S corporations or other pass-through entities or investors in
partnerships; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; controlled foreign corporations; passive foreign
investment companies; former citizens or residents of the United States; U.S. expatriates; holders whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar; holders who hold shares of MainSource common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, or conversion
transaction or other integrated investment; holders who acquired MainSource common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation; holders who exercise appraisal rights; or
holders who actually or constructively own more than 5% of MainSource’s voting stock).

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of MainSource common stock that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (1) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation, or entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia, (3) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made
a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (4) an estate, the income of which is
includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of its source.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a holder of MainSource common stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is a holder of MainSource common stock,
and any partners in such partnership, should consult their own independent tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the
merger to their specific circumstances.

Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complex and will depend on your specific situation and on
factors that are not within First Financial’s or MainSource’s control. You should consult your own independent tax advisor as to the
specific tax consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative
minimum tax and any state, local, foreign, and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally

Subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described herein, Squire Patton Boggs, counsel to First Financial, and
SmithAmundsen LLC, counsel to MainSource, are of the opinion that the merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It

TABLE OF CONTENTS

is a condition to the obligation of First Financial to complete the merger that First Financial receive an opinion from Squire Patton
Boggs, dated the closing date of the merger, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to the obligation of MainSource to complete the merger that MainSource receive an
opinion from SmithAmundsen, dated the closing date of the merger, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions will be based on facts and representations contained in
representation letters provided by First Financial and MainSource and on customary factual assumptions. Neither of the opinions
described above will be binding on the IRS or any court. First Financial and MainSource have not sought and will not seek any
ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue
Service will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition, if
any of the representations or assumptions upon which those opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders of MainSource
common stock.

If you are a U.S. holder of MainSource common stock:

• you will not recognize gain or loss if you are a MainSource shareholder who receives only First Financial stock in the
merger;

• the aggregate tax basis of the First Financial common stock that you receive in the merger (including any fractional shares
deemed received and redeemed for cash as described below) will equal your aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of
MainSource common stock you surrender in the merger; and

• the holding period for the shares of First Financial common stock that you receive in the merger (including any fractional
share deemed received and redeemed for cash as described below) will include your holding period of the shares of
MainSource common stock that you surrender in the merger.

If you acquired different blocks of MainSource common stock at different times or at different prices, the First Financial common
stock you receive will be allocated pro rata to each block of MainSource common stock, and the basis and holding period of each
block of First Financial common stock you receive will be determined on a block-for-block basis depending on the basis and
holding period of the blocks of MainSource common stock exchanged for such block of First Financial common stock.

If you receive cash instead of a fractional share of First Financial common stock, you generally will be treated as having received
such fractional share of First Financial common stock pursuant to the merger and then as having sold such fractional share of First
Financial common stock for cash. As a result, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
of cash received and the tax basis in your fractional share of First Financial common stock as set forth above. Such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the merger, the holding
period for such fractional share (including the holding period of shares of MainSource common stock surrendered therefor) exceeds
one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders of MainSource common stock, including individuals, are
generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

If you are a non-corporate holder of MainSource common stock, you may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information
reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on any cash payments you receive. Backup withholding may be
imposed on the above payments if you are a U.S. holder that (1) fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or appropriate
certificates or (2) otherwise fails to comply with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules or establish an
exemption. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and will generally be allowed as a
refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided you timely furnish the required information to the IRS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, tax
advice. Holders of MainSource common stock are urged to consult their independent tax advisors with respect to the application of
U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or
gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and explanatory notes show the historical financial
positions and results of operations of First Financial and MainSource, and have been prepared to illustrate the effects of the merger
involving First Financial and MainSource under the acquisition method of accounting with First Financial treated as the acquirer.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of MainSource, as of the effective date of the merger, will be
recorded by First Financial at their respective fair values and the excess of the merger consideration over the fair value of
MainSource’s net assets will be allocated to goodwill. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30,
2017 is presented as if the merger occured on June 30, 2017 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for
the periods ended June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are presented as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2016, the first
day of the First Financial 2016 fiscal year. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually
supportable items that are directly attributable to the merger and, with respect to the income statement only, expected to have a
continuing impact on consolidated results of operations.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of
the period presented. The adjustments included in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are
preliminary and may be revised. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not consider any
potential impacts of potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and expense efficiencies, or asset dispositions, among
other factors.

As explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the
pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is subject to
adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded at the time the merger is completed.
Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) MainSource’s balance sheet through the effective time of the merger;
(ii) the aggregate value of merger consideration paid if the price of First Financial’s stock varies from the assumed $28.10 per share;
(iii) total merger-related expenses if consummation and/or implementation costs vary from currently estimated amounts; and (iv) the
underlying values of assets and liabilities if market conditions differ from current assumptions.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information is not necessarily, and should not be assumed to be, an indication of the results
that would have been achieved had the transaction been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined
company after completion of the proposed transaction. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information and related adjustments required management to make certain assumptions and estimates. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements should be read together with:

• The accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information;

• First Financial’s separate unaudited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the
six months ended June 30, 2017, included in First Financial’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information

Note 1-Description of Transaction

On July 25, 2017, First Financial and MainSource announced that they had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which
MainSource will be merged with and into First Financial, with First Financial continuing as the surviving corporation. Following the
completion of the merger, MainSource Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of MainSource, will merge with and into First
Financial Bank, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of First Financial, with First Financial Bank continuing as the surviving bank. In
the merger, each share of MainSource common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger,
except for specified shares of MainSource common stock held by MainSource or First Financial, will be converted into the right to
receive 1.3875 shares of First Financial common stock. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares of First Financial common
stock that would otherwise be issued in connection with the merger.

Note 2-Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting
giving effect to the merger involving First Financial and MainSource, with First Financial as the acquirer. Certain reclassifications
have been made to MainSource historical information so as to conform to First Financial’s presentation, including instances where
certain amounts reflected individually by MainSource have been combined for presentation purposes as well as other instances
where accounts previously disclosed in footnotes by MainSource have been reflected individually for presentation purposes. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily
indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of the period
presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information provides for the issuance of 36,141,109 shares of
First Financial common stock in connection with the merger based on the number of shares of MainSource common stock
outstanding and reserved for issuance under various equity plans as of June 30, 2017, and the 1.3875 exchange ratio. Based on First
Financial’s closing stock price on July 25, 2017, the value of the aggregate stock consideration would be approximately $1.0 billion.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of MainSource will be recorded at the respective fair values on
the merger date. The fair value on the merger date represents management’s best estimates based on available information and facts
and circumstances in existence on the merger date. The pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will
be recorded at the time the merger is completed. Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) MainSource’s
balance sheet through the effective time of the merger; (ii) the aggregate value of merger consideration paid if the price of First
Financial’s stock varies from the assumed $28.10 per share; (iii) total merger-related expenses if consummation and/or
implementation costs vary from currently estimated amounts; and (iv) the underlying values of assets and liabilities if market
conditions differ from current assumptions.

The accounting policies of both First Financial and MainSource are in the process of being reviewed in detail. Upon completion of
such review, conforming adjustments or financial statement reclassification may be determined.

Note 3-Estimated Merger and Integration Costs

In connection with the merger, the plan to integrate First Financial’s and MainSource’s operations is still being developed. Over the
next several months, the specific details of these plans will continue to be refined. First Financial and MainSource are currently in
the process of assessing the two companies’ personnel, benefit plans, premises, equipment, computer systems, and service contracts
to determine where they may take advantage of redundancies or where it will be beneficial or necessary to convert to one system.
Certain decisions arising from these assessments may involve involuntary termination of employees, vacating leased premises,
changing information systems and benefit plans, cancelling contracts with service providers and selling or otherwise disposing of
certain premises, furniture and equipment. First Financial and MainSource expect to incur merger-related expenses including system
conversion costs, employee retention and severance agreements, communications to customers, and others. To the extent there are
costs associated with these actions, the costs will be recorded based on the nature and timing of these integration actions. Most

costs are recognized separately from a business combination and generally will be expensed as incurred. We estimated the merger-
related costs to be approximately $63 million and expect they will be incurred primarily in fiscal year 2018, which are not reflected
in the accompanying pro forma financial information.

Note 4-Estimated Annual Cost Savings

First Financial and MainSource expect to realize approximately $43 million in annual pre-tax cost savings following the merger,
which management expects realize to 75% in the first 12 months subsequent to closing the transaction and 100% thereafter.
However, there is no assurance that the anticipated cost savings will be realized on the anticipated time schedule or at all. These cost
savings are not reflected in the presented pro forma financial information.

Note 5-Estimated Regulatory Adjustments

Upon completion of the merger, First Financial’s bank subsidiary’s total assets will exceed $10 billion, and First Financial and its
bank subsidiary will therefore become subject to increased regulatory requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing
regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including
compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing
requirements. No adjustments related to compliance with these additional regulatory requirements were made to the pro forma
financial statements included herein.

Note 6-Pro Forma Merger Adjustments

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. All
taxable adjustments were calculated using a 35% tax rate to arrive at deferred tax asset or liability adjustments. All adjustments are
based on current assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change.

Note 7-Preliminary Purchase Accounting Allocation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects the issuance of approximately 36,141,091 shares of
First Financial common stock totaling approximately $1.0 billion. The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of
accounting; accordingly the First Financial cost to acquire MainSource will be allocated to the assets (including identifiable
intangible assets) and liabilities of MainSource at their respective estimated fair values as of the merger date. Accordingly, the pro
forma purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values as summarized in the following table.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF FIRST FINANCIAL

As a result of the merger, MainSource shareholders who receive shares of First Financial common stock in the merger will become
shareholders of First Financial. Your rights as a shareholder of First Financial will be governed by the OGCL, the First Financial
articles of incorporation, and the First Financial regulations. The following briefly summarizes the material terms of First Financial
common stock that will be issued in connection with the merger. We urge you to read the applicable provisions of the OGCL, the
First Financial articles of incorporation, and the First Financial regulations. Copies of First Financial’s and MainSource’s governing
documents have been filed with the SEC. To find out where copies of these documents can be obtained, see “Where You Can Find
More Information.”

Authorized Capital Stock

First Financial’s authorized capital stock consists of 160,000,000 common shares, without par value (“common shares”) and
10,000,000 preferred shares, with or without par value as determined by First Financial's board of directors (“preferred shares”). As
of the First Financial record date, 62,068,758 of First Financial’s common shares were outstanding, 6,661,973 of First Financial’s
common shares were held by First Financial in treasury, and none of First Financial’s preferred shares were issued or outstanding.

Common Shares

Holders of First Financial’s common shares are entitled to:

• cast one vote for each common share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders;

• receive dividends when, as and if declared by First Financial’s board of directors from funds legally available therefor,
subject to the rights of holders of preferred shares, if any; and

• share ratably in First Financial’s net assets legally available to First Financial’s shareholders in the event of its liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up, after provision for the distribution of any preferential amounts to the holders of preferred
shares, if any.

Holders of First Financial’s common shares have no preemptive, subscription, preference, redemption, conversion, exchange, or
cumulative voting rights. The rights, preferences, and privileges of the holders of First Financial’s common shares are subject to,
and may be adversely affected by, the rights, preferences, and privileges of holders of any preferred shares that First Financial may
designate and issue in the future.

Subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, First Financial’s common shares may be transferred without
any restrictions or limitations. The transfer agent and registrar for First Financial’s common shares is Registrar and Transfer
Company.

First Financial’s common shares are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market® under the symbol “FFBC.” First
Financial’s outstanding common shares are, and any common shares that First Financial issues under this prospectus and any
applicable prospectus supplement will be, when issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Preferred Shares

First Financial’s articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue, without any further vote or action by First
Financial’s shareholders, subject to certain limitations prescribed by law and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on
which First Financial’s securities may be listed, up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 preferred shares in one or more series.

Subject to the limitations described in the next paragraph, the First Financial board of directors is also authorized to determine and
fix the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, conversion, and other special rights of each series of
preferred shares issued from time to time, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof, including the designation and
authorized number of each series, dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, redemption and exchange rights, sinking fund
requirements, and liquidation rights. The First Financial board of directors may increase or decrease the number of shares of any
series of preferred shares before or after the issue of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding.
If the number of preferred shares of any series is so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease will resume the status of
authorized but unissued shares. Under Ohio law, the authority of a board to establish the par value of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

preferred shares is not settled even if such authority is provided in the corporation’s articles. Consequently, First Financial’s
preferred shares will be issued without par value unless the board of directors determines to issue preferred shares with par value
after having been advised by counsel that it has the authority to do so.

The First Financial articles of incorporation provide that the voting rights of each preferred share are limited to no more than one
vote per share when voting as a class with the common shares, and the preferred shares will not vote as a separate class or series
except as required by Ohio law. The First Financial board of directors has represented that it will not issue, without prior shareholder
approval, any series of preferred shares for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose, for the purpose of implementing a shareholder
rights plan, or with features specifically intended to make any attempted acquisition of the company more difficult or costly.

The First Financial board of directors will fix the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, conversion,
and other special rights of each series of preferred shares that First Financial offers under this prospectus and any applicable
prospectus supplement, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of such series, in a certificate of amendment to First
Financial’s articles of incorporation relating to that series. First Financial will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which
this prospectus is a part, or incorporate by reference therein from another report that First Financial files with the SEC, the form of
any certificate of amendment to First Financial’s articles of incorporation that describes the terms of the series of preferred shares
that First Financial is offering before the issuance of the related series of preferred shares. First Financial will also describe in the
applicable prospectus supplement the terms of the series of preferred shares being offered.

First Financial’s board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with voting, conversion, or other rights that could
adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of First Financial’s common shares. The issuance of preferred shares
could have the effect of decreasing the market price of First Financial’s common shares, restricting First Financial’s ability to
repurchase outstanding common shares, decreasing the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of First
Financial’s common shares and creating restrictions upon the payment and amount of dividends and other distributions to holders of
First Financial’s common shares. The issuance of preferred shares also could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a
change in control of First Financial without further action by First Financial’s shareholders. When First Financial issues preferred
shares under this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, such preferred shares will be fully paid and nonassessable.

Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of First Financial’s Articles of Incorporation and Ohio Law

First Financial’s articles of incorporation and the OGCL contain certain provisions that make it more difficult to acquire control of
First Financial by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, a proxy fight or otherwise. These provisions are designed to
encourage persons seeking to acquire control of First Financial to negotiate with the board of directors. First Financial believes that,
as a general rule, the interests of its shareholders would be best served if any change in control results from negotiations with the
board of directors. Certain provisions of First Financial’s articles of incorporation and regulations may have the effect of impeding
the acquisition of control of First Financial by means of a tender offer, a proxy fight, open-market purchases or otherwise in a
transaction not approved by First Financial’s board of directors.

The provisions of First Financial’s articles of incorporation and regulations which may discourage efforts to acquire control include
the following:

• First Financial’s articles of incorporation do not allow cumulative voting for election of directors;

• if a special shareholders meeting of First Financial is called by shareholders, it must be called by holders of not less than
one-half of the outstanding voting power of First Financial;

• nomination of candidates for election to First Financial’s board of directors requires advance notice containing certain
information of the nominee. First Financial may also require any proposed nominee to furnish other information
reasonably required by First Financial to determine the proposed nominee’s eligibility to serve as a director; and

• First Financial’s regulations may be amended only (a) by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding voting power of First Financial, unless such amendment is recommended by the affirmative vote of two-thirds
of the whole authorized number of directors, in which case the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

regulations may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of First
Financial, or (b) by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the whole authorized number of directors to the extent permitted
by Ohio law.

The provisions described above are intended to reduce First Financial’s vulnerability to takeover attempts and certain other
transactions which have not been negotiated with and approved by members of First Financial’s board of directors.

The OGCL provides that the approval of two-thirds of the voting power of a corporation is required to effect mergers and similar
transactions, to adopt amendments to the articles of incorporation of a corporation and to take certain other significant actions.
Although under Ohio law the articles of incorporation of a corporation may permit such actions to be taken by a vote that is less
than two-thirds (but not less than a majority), First Financial’s articles of incorporation do not contain such a provision. The two-
thirds voting requirement tends to make approval of such matters, including further amendments to the articles of incorporation,
relatively difficult, and a vote of the holders of in excess of one-third of First Financial’s outstanding common shares would be
sufficient to prevent implementation of any of the corporate actions mentioned above.

Ohio Revised Code Section 1701.831 is a “control share acquisition” statute. The control share acquisition statute basically provides
that any person acquiring shares of an “issuing public corporation” (which definition First Financial meets) in any of the following
three ownership ranges must seek and obtain shareholder approval of the acquisition transaction that first puts such ownership
within each such range: (i) more than 20% but less than 33 1/3%; (ii) 33 1/3% but not more than 50%; and (iii) more than 50%.

The purpose of the control share acquisition statute is to give shareholders of Ohio corporations a reasonable opportunity to express
their views on a proposed shift in control, thereby reducing the coercion inherent in an unfriendly takeover. The provisions of the
control share acquisition statute grant to First Financial’s shareholders the assurance that they will have adequate time to evaluate
the proposal of the acquiring person, that they will be permitted to vote on the issue of authorizing the acquiring person’s purchase
in the same manner and with the same proxy information that would be available to them if a proposed merger of First Financial
were before them and, most importantly, that the interests of all shareholders will be taken into account in connection with such vote
and the probability will be increased that they will be treated equally regarding the price to be offered for their common shares if the
purchase is approved.

The control share acquisition statute applies not only to traditional offers but also to open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions and original issuances by an Ohio corporation, whether friendly or unfriendly. The procedural requirements of the
control share acquisition statute could render approval of any control share acquisition difficult because it must be authorized at a
special meeting of shareholders, at which a quorum is present, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power
represented and by a majority of the portion of such voting power, excluding interested shares. Any corporate defense against
persons seeking to acquire control may have the effect of discouraging or preventing offers which some First Financial shareholders
might find financially attractive. On the other hand, the need on the part of the acquiring person to convince First Financial’s
shareholders of the value and validity of the offer may cause such offer to be more financially attractive in order to gain shareholder
approval.

Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1704 is a “merger moratorium” statute. The merger moratorium statute provides that, unless a
corporation’s articles of incorporation or regulations otherwise provide, an “issuing public corporation” (which definition First
Financial meets) may not engage in a “Chapter 1704 transaction” for three years following the date on which a person acquires
more than 10% of the voting power in the election of directors of the issuing corporation, unless the Chapter 1704 transaction is
approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to such transaction. A person who acquires such voting power is an
“interested shareholder,” and “Chapter 1704 transactions” involve a broad range of transactions, including mergers, consolidations,
combinations, liquidations, recapitalizations and other transactions between an issuing public corporation and an interested
shareholder if such transactions involve 5% of the assets or shares of the issuing public corporation or 10% of its earning power.
After the initial three year moratorium, Chapter 1704 prohibits such transactions absent approval by disinterested shareholders or
the transaction meeting certain statutorily defined fair price provisions. One significant effect of Chapter 1704 is to encourage a
person to negotiate with a corporation’s board of directors prior to becoming an interested shareholder.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Ohio also has enacted Ohio Revised Code Section 1707.043, which provides that a person who announces a control bid must
disgorge profits realized by that person upon the sale of any equity securities within 18 months of the announcement.

In addition, Section 1701.59 of the Ohio Revised Code provides that, in determining what a director reasonably believes to be in the
best interests of the corporation, such director may consider, in addition to the interests of the corporation’s shareholders, any of the
interests of the corporation’s employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the State of Ohio and the United States,
community and societal considerations and the long-term as well as the short-term interests in the corporation and its shareholders,
including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation.

The overall effect of these statutes may be to render more difficult or discourage the removal of incumbent management or the
assumption of effective control by other persons.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF FIRST FINANCIAL SHAREHOLDERS AND MAINSOURCE SHAREHOLDERS

MainSource shareholders who receive First Financial common shares as consideration in the merger will become shareholders
of First Financial at the effective time of the merger. First Financial is an Ohio corporation while MainSource is an Indiana
corporation. Although the rights of the holders of First Financial common shares and those of holders of MainSource shares are
similar in many respects, there are some differences. These differences relate to differences between the laws governing Ohio
corporations, the OGCL and the laws governing Indiana corporations, the IBCL, as well as differences between provisions of First
Financial’s articles of incorporation and regulations and MainSource’s articles of incorporation and bylaws.

Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the rights of First Financial shareholders and the rights of
MainSource shareholders. This description is not intended to be a complete statement of the differences affecting the rights of
MainSource shareholders, but rather describes the more significant differences affecting the rights of MainSource shareholders and
certain important similarities. Copies of First Financial’s and MainSource’s governing documents have been filed with the SEC. To
find out where copies of these documents can be obtained, please see “Where You Can Find More Information.”

FIRST FINANCIAL MAINSOURCE
AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

First Financial is authorized to issue 160,000,000 shares of
common stock, without par value, and 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, without par value.

MainSource is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common
stock, without par value, and 400,000 shares of preferred stock,
without par value.

As of the First Financial record date, First Financial had
62,068,758 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares
of preferred stock outstanding. First Financial common stock is
listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “FFBC.”

As of the MainSource record date, MainSource had 25,582,413
shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred
stock outstanding. MainSource common stock is listed on
NASDAQ under the symbol “MSFG.”

First Financial’s board of directors is authorized, by filing
articles of amendment, to provide for the issuance of preferred
stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences, and
rights thereof. First Financial’s board of directors has the
authority to determine and fix any express terms with respect
to each series to the fullest extent permitted by the Ohio
Revised Code.

MainSource’s board of directors has authority by resolution to
issue preferred stock in one or more series. If any series of
preferred stock is issued, the MainSource board of directors may
fix the designation, powers, preferences and voting, relative
participating, optional and other rights, and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions of the shares of that series of preferred
stock.

DIVIDENDS
Subject to any rights of holders of First Financial preferred
stock, the holders of First Financial common stock are entitled
to receive dividends, if and when declared payable from time
to time by First Financial’s board of directors, from any funds
legally available therefor.

MainSource may pay dividends and make other distributions at
such times, in such amounts, to such persons, for such
consideration, and upon such terms and conditions as
MainSource’s board of directors may determine, subject to all
statutory restrictions, including banking law restrictions.

However, the Federal Reserve Board expects First Financial, as
a bank holding company, to serve as a source of strength to its
subsidiary banks, which may require First Financial to retain
capital for further investments in its subsidiary banks, rather
than for dividends for its shareholders.

Under the IBCL, no distribution may be declared or paid if, after
giving it effect, (1) the corporation would not be able to pay its
debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (2)
the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its
total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit
otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation
were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the
preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose

 preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

The board of directors may base a determination regarding the
legality of the declaration or payment of a distribution on
financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices
and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair
valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS; CLASSIFICATION
First Financial’s board of directors currently consists of
thirteen members. First Financial’s regulations provide that the
number may be increased or decreased (provided the number is
never less than nine or more than 25) by resolution of the
board of directors (by vote of two-thirds of the whole
authorized number of directors) or by resolution of the
shareholders at a meeting of shareholders for electing directors
(by vote of two-thirds of the outstanding voting power). First
Financial’s board of directors consists of a single class of
directors.

MainSource’s board of directors currently consists of nine
members. MainSource’s bylaws provide that the number of
directors shall be not less than five (5) and not more than fifteen
(15), as fixed by resolution of the board of directors from time to
time. The MainSource articles of incorporation do not provide for
a division of the MainSource board of directors into classes, and
the MainSource bylaws specifically opt out of the provision in the
IBCL providing for staggered terms of directors

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; VACANCIES
Director nominees who receive the greatest number of
shareholder votes are automatically elected to the board, but
First Financial has adopted a policy requiring nominees who
receive a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or her
election than votes “for” his or her election to tender written
resignation to the Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee for consideration.

Pursuant to the IBCL, the MainSource directors are elected by a
plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the
election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
   
MainSource’s articles of incorporation do not grant cumulative
voting rights to the MainSource shareholders.
   
MainSource’s bylaws provide that any vacancy occurring in
MainSource's board of directors, including a vacancy created by
an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled for the
remainder of the unexpired term only by a majority vote of the
members of the board of directors of MainSource then in office.

First Financial’s articles of incorporation provide that
shareholders shall not have the right to vote cumulatively in
the election of directors.
The First Financial directors are elected at a meeting of
shareholders, except that a majority of the directors in office at
any time, though less than a majority of the whole authorized
number of directors, may, by the vote of a majority of their
number, fill any director’s office that is created by an increase
in the number of directors or by a vacancy. However, in any
period between annual meetings of shareholders, the directors
cannot increase the number of directors by more than three.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
A First Financial director may be removed with or without
cause.

Under the MainSource bylaws, any director or the entire board of
directors may be removed, with or without cause, by a vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an
election of directors. Additionally, any director may be removed,
with or without cause, by a vote of the board of directors.

a signed and dated written demand for a special meeting from the
holders of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of all the votes
entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the
proposed special meeting.

First Financial’s regulations provide that the holders of record
of a majority of shares entitled to vote at each meeting of

quorum.

MainSource’s bylaws provide that a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall

FIRST FINANCIAL MAINSOURCE
ADVANCE NOTICE REGARDING SHAREHOLDERS NOMINATION OF CANDIDATES FOR ELECTION TO THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
First Financial’s regulations provide that nomination for
election of directors may be made by any shareholder by
delivering written notice to the Secretary of First Financial not
later than (i) for an annual meeting of shareholders, 90 days
prior to the date one year from the date of the immediately
preceding annual meeting of shareholders, and (ii) for a special
meeting of shareholders, the close of business on the tenth day
following the date on which notice of such meeting is first
given to shareholders.

MainSource’s bylaws provide that shareholders may nominate
directors for election, provided such nominations are made
pursuant to timely notice in writing to the nominating committee,
care of the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a
shareholder’s notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received
at the principal office of the Corporation not less than 60 days nor
more than 90 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that
in the event that less than 70 days’ notice or prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so
received not later than the close of business on the 10th day
following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting
was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such
shareholders’ notice shall set forth such information, as the
nominating committee shall determine.

The notice shall set forth the information about the nominee
specified in First Financial’s regulations. First Financial may
also require any proposed nominee to furnish other information
reasonably required by First Financial to determine the
proposed nominee’s eligibility to serve as a director.

SHAREHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT
Under the OGCL, unless a corporation’s articles of
incorporation or regulations prohibit action by shareholders
without a meeting, shareholders may act without a meeting on
any action required or permitted to be taken at a shareholder
meeting, provided that all shareholders entitled to notice of the
meeting sign a writing authorizing the action, and the
shareholders file the writing with the records of the
corporation.

The IBCL permits any action required or permitted to be taken at
a meeting of shareholders to be taken without a meeting, by
unanimous written consent of all shareholders entitled to vote on
the matter.
   
MainSource’s articles of incorporation and bylaws do not alter
such shareholders’ right.

First Financial’s articles of incorporation regulations do not

FIRST FINANCIAL MAINSOURCE
AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND REGULATIONS

First Financial’s articles of incorporation do not specifically
provide for its amendment and, therefore, may be amended in
accordance with the OGCL.

The IBCL generally requires the approval of at least a majority of
a quorum of shareholders present at a shareholders’ meeting (and,
in certain cases, a majority of all shares held by any voting group
entitled to vote) for amendments to an Indiana corporation’s
articles of incorporation. Amendments to the MainSource articles
of incorporation must be approved by a majority vote of
MainSource’s board of directors and also by a majority vote of
the outstanding shares of MainSource’s voting stock.
   
MainSource’s bylaws may be amended or repealed by a vote of a
majority of the entire board of directors of MainSource. The
MainSource bylaws may not be amended or repealed by the
shareholders of MainSource.

First Financial’s regulations provide that the regulations may
be amended only (a) by the vote of the holders of two-thirds of
the outstanding voting power of First Financial voting as a
single class at a meeting of shareholders called for such
purpose, unless such amendment is recommended by the vote
of two-thirds of the whole authorized number of directors, in
which case the regulations may be amended by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting
power voting as a single class at a meeting of shareholders
called for such purpose or (b) by the affirmative vote of two-
thirds of the whole authorized number of directors to the extent
permitted by Ohio law.
