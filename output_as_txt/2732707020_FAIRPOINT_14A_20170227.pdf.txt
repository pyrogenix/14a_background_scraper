Merger Proposal—Your Vote Is Important

To the Stockholders of Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. and
the Stockholders of FairPoint Communications, Inc.:

          On December 3, 2016, Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. ("Consolidated") and FairPoint Communications, Inc. ("FairPoint") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Consolidated has agreed to acquire FairPoint. The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of FairPoint through a statutory merger of Falcon Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Consolidated, with and into FairPoint, with FairPoint as the surviving entity (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and FairPoint will continue as the surviving corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated.

          In the proposed Merger, each issued and outstanding share of FairPoint common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.7300 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Consolidated common stock, subject to certain
exceptions, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each share of FairPoint common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. Each certificate formerly representing any share of FairPoint common stock and each uncertificated share registered to a holder on
the stock transfer books of FairPoint, shall thereafter represent only the right to receive shares of Consolidated common stock.

          Consolidated common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "CNSL." On February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of
Consolidated common stock was $25.72 per share. FairPoint common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "FRP." The shares of Consolidated common stock issued pursuant to the Merger will be registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and will trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

          FairPoint will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on March 28, 2017 at 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, at The Westin Charlotte, 601 South College Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202. At the FairPoint special meeting, FairPoint's
stockholders will be asked (i) to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (ii) to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the change in control payments to FairPoint's named executive
officers, and (iii) to adjourn or postpone the FairPoint special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, for, among other reasons, the solicitation of additional proxies.

          Consolidated will hold a special meeting of stockholders on March 28, 2017 at 9:00 a.m., Central time, at Consolidated's corporate headquarters, 121 South 17th Street, Mattoon, Illinois 61938. At the Consolidated special meeting,
Consolidated's stockholders will be asked (i) to approve the issuance of Consolidated common stock to FairPoint stockholders in the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) to adjourn or postpone the Consolidated special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, for, among other reasons, the solicitation of additional proxies.

          The board of directors of FairPoint recommends that FairPoint's stockholders vote "FOR" each of (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
(ii) the approval, by a non-binding advisory vote, of the change in control payments to FairPoint's named executive officers, and (iii) the proposal to adjourn or postpone the FairPoint special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, for,
among other reasons, the solicitation of additional proxies.

          The board of directors of Consolidated recommends that Consolidated's stockholders vote "FOR" each of (i) the issuance of Consolidated common stock to FairPoint stockholders in the Merger contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (ii) the proposal to adjourn or postpone the Consolidated special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, for, among other reasons, the solicitation of additional proxies.

          YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend the Consolidated special meeting or the FairPoint special meeting, as applicable, please take the time to vote by using the Internet or by telephone as
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or by completing the enclosed proxy card and mailing it in the enclosed envelope. Information about the meetings, the Merger and the other business to be considered at the meetings is
contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully.

          In particular, you should read the section entitled "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger" beginning on page 35 for a discussion of some of the risks you should consider in
evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Merger and how they will affect you.

          Thank you for your cooperation and continued support.

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulator has approved or disapproved the Merger Agreement and the Merger described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the Consolidated common
stock to be issued in the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

   

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is dated February 24, 2017 and is first being mailed to Consolidated's and FairPoint's stockholders on or about February 28, 2017.

        For certain questions and answers about the Consolidated special meeting, see the section entitled "Questions and Answers about the Consolidated Special Meeting" on page 10.

What is the purpose of this joint proxy statement/prospectus? 

        The purpose of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is to provide information regarding matters to be voted on at the FairPoint special meeting. Proxies are solicited by the FairPoint
board of directors (the "FairPoint Board") to give all FairPoint's stockholders of record as of the record date, February 17, 2017, an opportunity to vote on the matters to be presented at the
FairPoint special meeting, even if the stockholders cannot attend the meeting. The FairPoint Board has designated Karen D. Turner and Peter G. Nixon as proxies, who will vote the shares
represented by proxies at the FairPoint special meeting in the manner indicated by the proxies.

What proposals will be voted on at the FairPoint special meeting? 

        FairPoint's stockholders will vote on the following proposals at the FairPoint special meeting:

• The proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into FairPoint, with FairPoint as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Consolidated, and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger (the "FairPoint Merger Proposal");

Table of Contents

• The proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the change in control payments to FairPoint's named executive officers (the "FairPoint Change in Control Payments
Proposal"); and 

• The proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the FairPoint special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, for, among other reasons, the solicitation of additional
proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes at the time of the FairPoint special meeting to approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal (the "FairPoint Adjournment
Proposal").

What is the Merger? 

        In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, if FairPoint's stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, and Consolidated's stockholders approve the issuance of Consolidated common stock to FairPoint's stockholders in the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into FairPoint, and FairPoint will be the surviving corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex I to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Is my vote necessary to complete the Merger? 

        The Merger cannot be completed unless, among other things, FairPoint's stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger.

        FairPoint and Consolidated have agreed to combine the two companies upon the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement that is described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
You are receiving these proxy materials to help you decide, among other matters, how to vote your shares of FairPoint with respect to the proposed Merger.

        The FairPoint special meeting is being held to vote on, among other matters, the proposals necessary to complete the Merger. Information about the FairPoint special meeting, the Merger
and the other business to be considered by FairPoint's stockholders is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Your vote is important. FairPoint encourages you to vote as soon as possible.

Are there other matters related to the Merger that require the vote of FairPoint's stockholders? 

        Yes. At the FairPoint special meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the agreements and understandings of
FairPoint and its named executive officers concerning compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the aggregate total of all
such compensation that may be paid or become payable to or on behalf of such executive officers (the "change in control payments"), as disclosed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in
the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of FairPoint Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Change in Control Benefits for Executive Officers" on page 85.

What will stockholders receive in the Merger? 

        FairPoint's stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.7300 shares of Consolidated common stock for each share of FairPoint common stock owned at the effective time of the Merger. No
fractional shares of Consolidated common stock will be issued. Each of FairPoint's stockholders will be entitled to receive, in lieu of any fractional share of Consolidated common stock, an
amount in cash equal to the

value of the fractional share of Consolidated common stock to which such stockholder would otherwise have been entitled, less applicable taxes required to be withheld.

        After completion of the Merger, each Consolidated stockholder will have the same number of shares of Consolidated common stock that such stockholder held immediately prior to the
completion of the Merger. However, upon issuance of the shares of Consolidated common stock to FairPoint's stockholders in connection with the Merger, each share of Consolidated common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Merger will represent a smaller percentage of the aggregate number of shares of Consolidated common stock outstanding after the
completion of the Merger. On the other hand, each share of Consolidated common stock will then represent an interest in a company with more assets.

What happens if the Merger is not consummated? 

        If (i) FairPoint's stockholders do not approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal, (ii) the issuance of Consolidated common stock to FairPoint's stockholders in the Merger as contemplated by
the Merger Agreement is not approved by the Consolidated's stockholders or (iii) the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any shares of Consolidated common
stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, FairPoint will remain an independent public company and its common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Capital
Market. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, FairPoint may be obligated to pay Consolidated a termination fee of $18.9 million, and upon termination of the
Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances, Consolidated may be obligated to pay FairPoint a termination fee of $18.9 million, as described more fully in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees; Expenses" on page 112.

Where and when is the FairPoint special meeting? 

        The FairPoint special meeting will be held at 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, on March 28, 2017, at The Westin Charlotte, 601 South College Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202. Cameras,
recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the FairPoint special meeting.

What should I do if I want to attend the FairPoint special meeting? 

        To be admitted to the FairPoint special meeting, FairPoint's stockholders should:

• Provide enough time to ensure that they are seated by the commencement of the FairPoint special meeting at 11:00 a.m., Eastern time; 

• Bring photo identification, such as a driver's license; and 

• Bring proof of ownership of FairPoint stock on the record date, February 17, 2017, such as a brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker indicating ownership on
February 17, 2017, a proxy card, legal proxy or voting instruction card provided by such stockholder's broker, bank or nominee.

        Any holder of a proxy from a stockholder must present a properly executed legal proxy and a copy of the proof of ownership. If a FairPoint stockholder does not provide photo
identification and comply with the other procedures outlined above for attending the FairPoint special meeting in person, such stockholder will not be admitted to attend in person.

Table of Contents

Who can vote at the FairPoint special meeting? 

        All of FairPoint's stockholders can vote at the FairPoint special meeting if such stockholders owned shares of FairPoint common stock as of the close of business on February 17, 2017,
which is the record date for the FairPoint special meeting.

What vote of FairPoint's stockholders is required to approve the proposals? 

• The FairPoint Merger Proposal.  The FairPoint Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of FairPoint's common stock
entitled to vote on such proposal. 

• The FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal.  The FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal. 

• The FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.  The FairPoint Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal.

What constitutes a quorum for the FairPoint special meeting? 

        FairPoint will hold the FairPoint special meeting if stockholders representing the required quorum of shares of common stock entitled to vote either sign and return their proxy card by
mail, deliver their proxy via the Internet at the website provided in the proxy materials, deliver their proxy via the toll free number provided on the proxy card or attend the FairPoint special
meeting. FairPoint's bylaws provide that holders of one-third in voting power of the capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the FairPoint special meeting, present in person
or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the FairPoint special meeting. If you submit a proxy, whether by Internet, telephone or mail, your shares will be counted to determine
whether we have a quorum even if you abstain or fail to vote as indicated on the proxy card. Broker non-votes will not count towards the quorum requirement.

How does the FairPoint Board recommend that FairPoint's stockholders vote? 

        The FairPoint Board has determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable to, and in the best interest of, FairPoint and
its stockholders and recommends that FairPoint's stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

        The FairPoint Board is soliciting stockholder votes consistent with the FairPoint Board's recommendation. You should read the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the
FairPoint Board; FairPoint's Reasons for the Merger" on page 55 for a discussion of the factors that the FairPoint Board considered in deciding to recommend voting "FOR" the FairPoint
Merger Proposal.

How do I vote? 

        If you are a FairPoint stockholder of record, as of the record date, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you may vote
by any of the following methods:

• Internet.  Electronically through the Internet by accessing www.envisionreports.com/FRP or use your smartphone to scan the QR code on your proxy card. You may vote
through the Internet until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on March 27, 2017. Have your proxy card in hand when you access the website and follow the instructions to obtain your
records and create an electronic voting instruction form. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day, and the procedures are designed to authenticate votes cast by using a control
number located on your proxy card. These procedures allow you to give a proxy to vote your shares and to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you
vote through the Internet, you should not return your proxy card. 

• Telephone.  By calling 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) within the United States, U.S. territories and Canada on a touch tone telephone. You may vote by telephone until 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern time, on March 27, 2017. This toll free number is also included on the proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day, and the procedures are designed to
authenticate votes cast by using a control number located on your proxy card. These procedures allow you to give a proxy to vote your shares and to confirm that your
instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone, you should not return your proxy card. 

• Mail.  By returning your proxy through the mail. If you complete and properly sign the accompanying proxy card and return it to FairPoint, it will be voted as you direct on the
proxy card. You should follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card, being sure to complete it, to sign it, and to mail it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. 

• In Person.  To vote in person at the FairPoint special meeting, you will need to request a ballot at the FairPoint special meeting.

        FairPoint recommends that you vote in advance even if you plan to attend the FairPoint special meeting so that FairPoint will know as soon as possible that enough votes will be present
for FairPoint to hold the FairPoint special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record and attend the FairPoint special meeting, you may vote at the FairPoint special meeting or deliver your
completed proxy card in person.

        If your shares are held in "street name," please refer to the information forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other holder of record to see what you must do to vote your shares,
including whether you may be able to vote electronically through your bank, broker or other record holder. If so, instructions regarding electronic voting will be provided by the bank, broker or
other holder of record to you as part of the package that includes this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If you are a "street name" beneficial holder of shares and you wish to vote in person at
the FairPoint special meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy from the institution that holds your shares and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot when you vote at the
FairPoint special meeting.

What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote? 

        If you properly return or submit your proxy but do not indicate how you wish to vote, FairPoint will count your proxy as voted as the FairPoint Board recommends. Therefore, your proxy
will be counted as a vote:

• "FOR" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and

Table of Contents

• "FOR" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

How are failures to vote and abstentions treated? 

        A failure to vote will:

• be treated as a vote "AGAINST" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• have no effect on the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• have no effect on the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

        Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote:

• "AGAINST" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• "AGAINST" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• "AGAINST" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

How are broker non-votes treated? 

        A broker "non-vote" occurs on a proposal when shares held of record by a broker are present or represented at a stockholder meeting but the broker is not permitted to vote on that
proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction has been given. Brokerage firms have the authority under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
rules to cast votes on certain "routine" matters if they do not receive instructions from their customers, but they do not have the authority to vote on "non-routine" matters. The FairPoint
Merger Proposal, the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal and the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal are considered "non-routine" matters. To the extent there are broker non-votes,
they will:

• be treated as a vote "AGAINST" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• have no effect on the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• have no effect on the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a "street name" beneficial holder of shares? 

        If your shares are registered directly in your name with FairPoint's transfer agent, Computershare, Inc., you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If this is
the case, the stockholder proxy materials have been sent or provided directly to you by FairPoint.

        If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial holder" of the shares held for you in what is known as "street name."
If this is the case, the proxy materials have been forwarded to you by your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, which is considered the stockholder of record with respect to these shares.
As the beneficial holder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Please contact your broker, bank, or other nominee for instructions on how to
vote any shares you beneficially own.

If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me? 

        If your shares are held for you as a beneficial owner in "street name," your broker will vote your shares on the proposals only if you provide instructions to your broker on how to vote.
You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the
effect of an "AGAINST"

vote for the FairPoint Merger Proposal and will have no effect on the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal and the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

Will anyone contact me regarding this vote? 

        FairPoint has retained Morrow Sodali Global, LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, Connecticut 06902 to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify certain records related to the
solicitation. FairPoint will pay Morrow Sodali Global, LLC a fee of $7,500, plus solicitation charges and reimbursement for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Such solicitations may be
made by mail, telephone, facsimile, e-mail, the Internet or personal interviews.

Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy? 

        Yes. You can change your vote before the FairPoint special meeting. If you are a FairPoint stockholder of record, you may change your proxy voting instructions in any of the following
ways:

• by sending a written notice to the corporate secretary of FairPoint that is received prior to the FairPoint special meeting stating that you revoke your proxy; 

• by submitting a subsequent proxy by Internet, telephone or mail with a later date; or 

• by attending the FairPoint special meeting and voting your shares.

        If your shares are held in "street name," you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker or other nominee holder in accordance with the procedures
established by it. Please contact your broker or other nominee and follow its directions in order to change your vote.

Should I send in my FairPoint stock certificates with my proxy card? 

        No. Please DO NOT send your FairPoint stock certificates with your proxy card.

What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders of FairPoint shares? 

        Each of Paul Hastings LLP, tax counsel to FairPoint, and Schiff Hardin LLP, tax counsel to Consolidated, is delivering an opinion at the closing of the Merger that the Merger will qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). However, neither FairPoint nor Consolidated has requested or
received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization. Assuming that the Merger qualifies as a reorganization, U.S. holders of FairPoint
shares should not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes when they exchange their FairPoint shares for shares of Consolidated common stock in the Merger, except
with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Consolidated common stock.

        The tax opinions regarding the Merger do not address any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the Merger.

        Please carefully review the information set forth in the section entitled "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 96 for a description of
the material United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger to each FairPoint stockholder will depend on such FairPoint stockholder's
own situation. FairPoint's stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the Merger to them.

When do FairPoint and Consolidated expect the Merger to be completed? 

        FairPoint and Consolidated are working to complete the Merger as quickly as possible. If (i) FairPoint's stockholders approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal, (ii) Consolidated's
stockholders approve the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal and (iii) the other conditions to completion of the Merger are satisfied or waived, including required regulatory approvals, it is
anticipated that the Merger will be completed in the middle of 2017. However, it is possible that factors outside the control of FairPoint and Consolidated could require FairPoint and
Consolidated to complete the Merger at a later time or not complete it at all. See the information set forth in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger
Agreement; Termination Fees; Expenses" on page 112.

        The commitments that Consolidated received from lenders in connection with its financing of the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby terminate on the earlier of
(i) September 30, 2017, or such later date as may be determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the twelve-month anniversary of such commitments, unless an extension is
agreed to by such lenders, as described further in the section entitled "Debt Financing" on page 117.

Can FairPoint's stockholders dissent and require appraisal of their shares? 

        No. FairPoint's stockholders do not have any appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Delaware law.

What happens if I sell my shares of FairPoint common stock before the FairPoint special meeting? 

        The record date of the FairPoint special meeting is earlier than the date of the FairPoint special meeting and the date that the Merger is expected to be completed. If you transfer your
shares of FairPoint common stock after the record date but before the FairPoint special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the FairPoint special meeting, but will have transferred the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be received by FairPoint's stockholders in the Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares through completion
of the Merger.

What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the FairPoint special meeting? 

        You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the FairPoint special meeting, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or
voting instruction forms. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy
card and voting instruction form that you receive or vote by telephone or Internet with respect to each proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive.

What is "householding"? 

        "Householding" allows companies to deliver only one copy of notices and other proxy materials to multiple stockholders who share the same address (if they appear to be members of the
same family) unless such company has received contrary instructions from an affected stockholder. FairPoint does not offer "householding" for stockholders of record. Please contact your
broker if you are not a stockholder of record to find out if your broker offers "householding."

What is the purpose of this joint proxy statement/prospectus? 

        The purpose of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is to provide information regarding matters to be voted on at the Consolidated special meeting. Proxies are solicited by Consolidated's
board of directors (the "Consolidated Board") to give all stockholders of record an opportunity to vote on the matters to be presented at the Consolidated special meeting, even if the
stockholders cannot attend the meeting. The Consolidated Board has designated Steven L. Childers and Steven J. Shirar as proxies, who will vote the shares represented by proxies at the
Consolidated special meeting in the manner indicated by the proxies.

What proposals will be voted on at the Consolidated special meeting? 

        Consolidated's stockholders will vote on the following proposals at the Consolidated special meeting:

• The proposal to approve of the issuance of Consolidated common stock to FairPoint's stockholders in the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Consolidated
Stock Issuance Proposal"); and 

• The proposal to adjourn or postpone the Consolidated special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, for, among other reasons, the solicitation of additional proxies in the event
that there are insufficient votes at the time of the Consolidated special meeting to approve the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal (the "Consolidated Adjournment
Proposal").

Who is entitled to vote? 

        Each outstanding share of Consolidated common stock entitles its holder to cast one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Consolidated special meeting. Only stockholders of record
at the close of business on the record date, February 17, 2017, are entitled to receive notice of the Consolidated special meeting and to vote the shares of common stock that they held on that
date at the meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. If your shares are held for you as a beneficial holder in "street name," please refer to the information forwarded to you
by your bank, broker or other holder of record to see what you must do to vote your shares.

        A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Consolidated special meeting will be available for examination by any stockholder at Consolidated's corporate headquarters, 121
South 17th Street, Mattoon, Illinois 61938, during normal business hours for a period of ten days before the Consolidated special meeting and at the time and place of the Consolidated special

What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial holder of shares? 

        If your shares are registered directly in your name with Consolidated's transfer agent, Computershare, Inc., you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If this
is the case, the stockholder proxy materials have been sent or provided directly to you by Consolidated.

        If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial holder" of the shares held for you in what is known as "street name."
If this is the case, the proxy materials have been forwarded to you by your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, which is considered the stockholder of record with respect to these shares.
As the beneficial holder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Please contact your broker, bank, or other nominee for instructions on how to
vote any shares you beneficially own.

Who can attend the meeting? 

        All stockholders of record as of February 17, 2017, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted
at the meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name," you will need to bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date.

What constitutes a quorum? 

        A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold the Consolidated special meeting. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of common
stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. As of February 17, 2017, the record date, 50,605,844 shares of Consolidated common stock were outstanding. Abstentions will
be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered present at the meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the
number of shares considered present at the meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Consolidated special meeting, Consolidated expects
that the Consolidated special meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies.

How do I vote? 

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by any of the following methods:

• Internet.  Electronically through the Internet by accessing Consolidated's materials using the information on your proxy card. To vote through the Internet, you should sign on to
this website and follow the procedures described at the website. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day, and the procedures are designed to authenticate votes cast by using a
personal identification number located on your proxy card. These procedures allow you to give a proxy to vote your shares and to confirm that your instructions have been
properly recorded. If you vote through the Internet, you should not return your proxy card. If you vote through the Internet, your proxy will be voted as you direct on the
website. 

• Telephone.  By calling 1-800-652-VOTE (8683). This toll free number is also included on the proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day, and the procedures are
designed to authenticate votes cast by using a personal identification number located on your proxy card. These procedures allow you to give a proxy to vote your shares and to
confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone, you should not return your proxy card. 

• Mail.  By returning your proxy through the mail. If you complete and properly sign the accompanying proxy card and return it to Consolidated, it will be voted as you direct on
the

proxy card. You should follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card, being sure to complete it, to sign it and to mail it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

• In Person.  In person at the meeting.

        Consolidated recommends that you vote in advance even if you plan to attend the meeting so that Consolidated will know as soon as possible that enough votes will be present for
Consolidated to hold the meeting. If you are a stockholder of record and attend the meeting, you may vote at the meeting or deliver your completed proxy card in person.

        If your shares are held in "street name," please refer to the information forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other holder of record to see what you must do in order to vote your
shares, including whether you may be able to vote electronically through your bank, broker or other record holder. If so, instructions regarding electronic voting will be provided by the bank,
broker or other holder of record to you as part of the package that includes this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If you are a "street name" stockholder and you wish to vote in person at the
meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy from the institution that holds your shares and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot when you vote at the Consolidated special
meeting.

Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card? 

        Yes. Even after you have submitted your proxy, you may change your vote at any time before the proxy is voted by:

• delivering to Consolidated's Secretary at the address set forth in the section entitled "The Consolidated Special Meeting—Date, Time and Place" on page 146 a written notice of
revocation of your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet; 

• delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date; or 

• voting in person at the Consolidated special meeting.

        If your shares are held in "street name," you may vote in person at the Consolidated special meeting if you obtain a proxy as described in the answer to the previous question.

How many votes are required for the proposals to pass? 

        The vote required for each of (i) the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal and (ii) the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal is the approval of a majority of the votes present, in person or
by proxy, and entitled to vote on the matter.

How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 

        Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote:

• "AGAINST" the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal; and 

• "AGAINST" the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal.

        A broker "non-vote" occurs on a proposal when shares held of record by a broker are present or represented at a stockholder meeting but the broker is not permitted to vote on that
proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction has been given. Brokerage firms have the authority under the NYSE rules to cast votes on certain
"routine" matters if they do not receive instructions from their customers, but they do not have the authority to vote on "non-routine" matters. The Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal and
the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal are considered "non-routine" matters. To the extent there are broker non-votes, they will:

• have no effect on the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal; and

• have no effect on the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal.

What if I do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy? 

        Stockholders should specify their choice for each matter on the enclosed proxy. If no specific instructions are given, proxies that are signed and returned will be voted:

• "FOR" the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal (see page 148); and 

• "FOR" the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal (see page 149).

What are the Consolidated Board's recommendations? 

        The Consolidated Board's recommendations, together with the description of each proposal, are set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In summary, the Consolidated Board
recommends that you vote:

• "FOR" the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal (see page 149); and 

• "FOR" the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal (see page 149).

        You should read the section entitled "The Merger—Consolidated's Reasons for the Merger" on page 73 for a discussion of the factors that the Consolidated Board considered in deciding
to recommend voting "FOR" the approval of the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal.

        Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the persons named as proxy holders on the enclosed proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the
Consolidated Board.

Will anyone contact me regarding this vote?

Ownership of Consolidated Following the Merger (page 92)

        Based on the number of shares of FairPoint common stock and Consolidated common stock outstanding on the record date, it is anticipated that, immediately following the Merger,
FairPoint's stockholders will own in the aggregate approximately 29.9% of the outstanding shares of Consolidated common stock.

Warrants to Purchase Shares of FairPoint Common Stock (page 140)

        Each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of FairPoint common stock will be converted into a warrant to acquire shares of Consolidated common stock, on the same terms and
conditions that were applicable to such FairPoint warrant, except that the number of shares of Consolidated common stock for which such warrant may be exercisable and the exercise
price of the warrant will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 96)

        Each of Paul Hastings LLP, tax counsel to FairPoint, and Schiff Hardin LLP, tax counsel to Consolidated, is delivering an opinion at the closing of the Merger that the Merger will
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that the Merger qualifies as a reorganization, FairPoint's stockholders should not recognize
any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes when they exchange their FairPoint shares for shares of Consolidated common stock in the Merger, except with respect to cash
received in lieu of fractional shares of Consolidated common stock. The tax opinions regarding the Merger do not address any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the Merger. The
tax opinions are subject to customary qualifications and assumptions, including that the Merger will be completed according to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In rendering the tax
opinions, each counsel is relying on representations of FairPoint, Merger Sub and Consolidated. If any such assumption or representation is or becomes inaccurate, the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger could be adversely affected. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or on any court.
Neither FairPoint nor Consolidated intends to request any ruling from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given
that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The tax consequences of
the Merger to each FairPoint stockholder will depend on such FairPoint stockholder's own situation. FairPoint's stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors for a
full understanding of the tax consequences of the Merger to them.

Recommendation of the FairPoint Board (page 55)

        The FairPoint Board, by unanimous vote, has determined that it is advisable to, and in the best interest of, FairPoint and its stockholders to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and unanimously recommends that stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the FairPoint Merger Proposal; 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal; and 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

Recommendation of the Consolidated Board (page 149)

        The Consolidated Board unanimously recommends that Consolidated's stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal; and 

• "FOR" the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to FairPoint (page 60 and Annex II)

        In connection with the Merger, FairPoint retained Evercore Group L.L.C. ("Evercore") to act as its financial advisor. On December 3, 2016, at a meeting of the FairPoint Board,
Evercore rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion that, based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumption, qualifications and
limitations set forth in its opinion, as of such date, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of common stock of FairPoint.

        The full text of the written opinion, dated December 3, 2016, of Evercore, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations on the review undertaken is attached as Annex II to this document. The summary of Evercore's opinion contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Evercore provided its opinion to the FairPoint Board (in its capacity as such) for the benefit and use of the FairPoint Board in
connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the exchange ratio from a financial point of view. Evercore's opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and
no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to FairPoint or as to the
underlying business decision of FairPoint to engage in the Merger. Evercore's opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed merger or any related matter.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Consolidated (page 75 and Annex III)

        On December 3, 2016, at a meeting of the Consolidated Board, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley"), rendered its oral opinion to the Consolidated Board, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 3, 2016, that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken as set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to Consolidated.

        The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley to the Consolidated Board, dated as of December 3, 2016, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex III and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You should read Morgan Stanley's opinion, this section and the summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion carefully and in
their entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley in rendering its opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion was directed to the Consolidated Board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial
point of view to Consolidated of the exchange ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of such opinion.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address any other aspects or implications of the Merger. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to
any holder of shares of Consolidated common stock as to how to vote at the Consolidated special meeting or whether to take any other action with respect to the Merger.

Interests of FairPoint Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 85)

        In considering the recommendation of the FairPoint Board with respect to the Merger, FairPoint's stockholders should be aware that some of FairPoint's directors and executive
officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of FairPoint's stockholders generally. The FairPoint Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal and recommending that FairPoint's stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of
the FairPoint Merger Proposal.

FairPoint common stock for all purposes of the Merger Agreement.

Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of FairPoint and Common Stockholders of Consolidated (page 131)

Consolidated the termination fee described above).

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 93)

        United States antitrust laws prohibit Consolidated and FairPoint from completing the Merger until they have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the HSR Act and a required waiting period has ended. FairPoint and Consolidated filed the required notification and
report forms with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on December 14, 2016. The required waiting period was terminated on
January 11, 2017.

        Completion of the Merger is also conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of certain governmental consents and regulatory approvals, including approval by the FCC and

Transportation Commission (the "Washington UTC") and certain other state and municipal utilities commissions.

Debt Financing (page 117)

        The Merger Agreement is not subject to any financing contingency. Consolidated intends to finance the repayment and redemption of existing indebtedness of FairPoint and pay
certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement with the proceeds of an incremental term loan facility, with any remaining
portion expected to be financed with cash on-hand or other sources of liquidity in an amount to be determined. The incremental term loan facility provides that Consolidated may incur
in a single draw an aggregate principal amount of up to $935.0 million that would be drawn at the closing of the transaction. The terms of the incremental term loan facility and the
covenants and agreements that each of Consolidated and FairPoint made in the Merger Agreement with respect to the debt financing, are described further under "Debt Financing" on
page 117 and "The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements with Respect to the Debt Financing" on page 108.

No Appraisal Rights for FairPoint's Stockholders (page 95)

        FairPoint's stockholders are not entitled to any appraisal rights for their shares under Delaware law in connection with the Merger. For further discussion, see the section entitled
"The Merger—No Appraisal Rights for FairPoint's stockholders" beginning on page 95.

joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger" section beginning on page 35 for a discussion of some of the risks related to the Merger Agreement

(2) In July 2012, Consolidated acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of SureWest Communications ("SureWest") in a cash and stock transaction. SureWest results of operations have been included in
Consolidated's consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date of July 2, 2012. 

(3) Acquisition and other transaction costs includes costs incurred related to acquisitions, including severance costs. 

(4) In 2014, Consolidated redeemed $72.8 million of the original aggregate principal amount of its $300.0 million 10.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). In connection with the redemption of the
2020 Notes, Consolidated recognized a loss of $13.8 million on the partial extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, Consolidated redeemed the remaining $227.2 million of
the 2020 Notes for $261.9 million and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. 

(5) In 2013, Consolidated entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to restate its term loan credit facility. In connection with entering into the restated credit agreement, Consolidated
incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013. 

(6) In 2012, Consolidated entered into a $350.0 million Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan Facility ("Bridge Facility") to fund the SureWest acquisition. During 2012, Consolidated incurred $4.2 million of
amortization related to the financing costs and $1.5 million of interest related to ticking fees associated with the Bridge Facility. In addition, in 2012, Consolidated entered into a Second Amendment and
Incremental Facility Agreement to amend its term loan facility. As a result, Consolidated incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million related to the repayment of its outstanding term loan. 

(7) In September 2013, Consolidated completed the sale of the assets and contractual rights of its prison services business for a total cash price of $2.5 million, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million, net of tax. The
financial results and net gain from the sale of the prison services business are included in income from discontinued operations for the years ended on or before December 31, 2013. 

(8) In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP" or "GAAP"), Consolidated also use certain non-GAAP measures such as
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of its historical results and trends. These financial measures are not a measure of financial performance
under US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. They are
not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are provided below. 

EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required
under Consolidated's credit facility as described in the reconciliations below. These measures are a common measure of operating performance in the telecommunications industry and are useful, with other
data, as a means to evaluate Consolidated's ability to fund its estimated uses of cash.

The following tables are a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA:

historic periods, except for December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 for which the data was not available. The billing integration effort resulted in standardizing the count methodologies between the two
different billing systems.

(1) Upon the October 26, 2009 filing of its petitions under Chapter 11 of Title 11 (the "Bankruptcy Code") of the United States Code protection and through January 24, 2011, in accordance with guidance under
the applicable reorganization accounting rules, FairPoint ceased to accrue interest expense on its 13-1/8% senior notes due April 1, 2018, its 13-1/8% senior notes due April 2, 2018 and its interest rate swap
agreements, as it was unlikely that such interest expense would be paid or would become an allowed priority secured or unsecured claim. FairPoint continued to accrue interest expense on the credit
agreement dated as of March 31, 2008, by and among FairPoint, Northern New England Spinco Inc., Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., as co-documentation agents, and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto as such interest was considered an allowed claim pursuant to
FairPoint's Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan"). All pre-petition debt was terminated on January 24, 2011. 

(2) On January 24, 2011, FairPoint emerged from Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code protection and substantially consummated its reorganization through a series of transactions contemplated by the Plan.

during the 24 days ended January 24, 2011, includes adjustments made upon application of the Plan and adoption of fresh start accounting, in addition to certain other items.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA: 

        FairPoint reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The table below includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and the
adjustments to the most directly comparable GAAP measure used to determine the non-GAAP measures. FairPoint believes that the non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors in understanding period-
to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. In addition, FairPoint believes the
non-GAAP measures are useful for investors because they enable them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by FairPoint's management. FairPoint believes earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), as adjusted to exclude the effect of items that are further described below ("Adjusted EBITDA"), provides a useful measure of covenant compliance. The
maintenance covenants contained in FairPoint's credit facility are based on Consolidated EBITDA, which is consistent with the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA below.

        For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA (in accordance with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in the Credit Agreement dated February 14, 2013 among FairPoint, as the borrower, and
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent (the "FairPoint Credit Agreement"), costs, expenses and charges related to the renegotiation of labor contracts including, but not limited to,
expenses for third-party vendors and losses related to disruption of operations (including any associated penalties under service level agreements and regulatory performance plans) are permitted to be
excluded from the calculation. FairPoint believes this includes, among others, the costs paid to third-parties for the contingent workforce and service quality penalties due to the disruption of operations. On
October 17, 2014, two of FairPoint's labor unions in northern New England initiated a work stoppage and returned to work on February 25, 2015. As a result, significant union employee and vehicle and
other related expenses related to northern New England were not incurred between October 17, 2014 and February 24, 2015 (the "work stoppage period"). Therefore, to assist in the evaluation of FairPoint's
operating performance without the impact of the work stoppage, FairPoint estimated the union employee and vehicle and other related expenses using historical data for the work stoppage period that
FairPoint believes would have been incurred absent the work stoppage ("Estimated Avoided Costs"). Estimated Avoided Costs is a pro forma estimate only. Actual costs absent the strike may have been
different. In 2014 and 2015, had FairPoint's incumbent workforce been in place, actual labor costs during the work stoppage period may have been higher than the $33.0 million and $27.0 million,
respectively, recorded as Estimated Avoided Costs due to significant winter storm activity that increased FairPoint's service demands; however, those incremental storm-related costs would have been an
allowed add back to Adjusted EBITDA under the FairPoint Credit Agreement. Estimated employee expenses avoided during the work stoppage period include salaries and wages, bonus, overtime,
capitalized labor, benefits, payroll taxes, travel expenses and other employee related costs based on a trailing twelve-month average calculated per striking employee per day during the work stoppage period
less any actual expense incurred. Estimated vehicle fuel and maintenance expense savings, which resulted from the contingent workforce utilizing their own vehicles, for the work stoppage period were
estimated based on a trailing twelve-month average of historical costs less actual expense incurred. FairPoint believes "Adjusted EBITDA minus Estimated Avoided Costs" may be useful to investors in
understanding its operating performance without the impact of the two unions' work stoppage in northern New England.

        The non-GAAP financial measures, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical
tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income or loss, operating income, cash flow or other combined income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus Estimated Avoided Costs should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or
reduce indebtedness. FairPoint compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using the non-GAAP measures only supplementally.

(A) For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA (in accordance with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in the FairPoint Credit Agreement), FairPoint adjusts net income/(loss) for interest, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization, in addition to: 

(1) the add-back of aggregate pension and other post-employment benefits expense, 

(2) the add-back (or subtraction) of the adjustment to the compensated absences accrual to eliminate the impact of changes in the accrual, 

(3) the add-back of costs related to the reorganization, including professional fees for advisors and consultants, 

(4) the add-back of costs and expenses, including those imposed by regulatory authorities, with respect to casualty events, acts of God or force majeure to the extent they are not reimbursed from
proceeds of insurance, 

(5) the add-back of other non-cash items, including stock compensation expense, except to the extent they will require a cash payment in a future period, and 

(6) the add-back (or subtraction) of other items, including facility and office closures, labor negotiation related expenses (including losses related to disruption of operations), non-cash gains/losses
and non-operating dividend and interest income and other extraordinary gains/losses. 

(B) See paragraphs preceding the table above for information regarding the calculation of this non-GAAP measure. 

(C) On October 16, 2014, FairPoint received payment and recorded one-time, non-operating income of $6.7 million, which is included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA in connection with a
settlement involving a litigation trust created for the benefit of creditors in FairPoint's bankruptcy filing.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

        The following summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information ("summary pro forma financial information") is based upon the historical consolidated
financial statements of Consolidated and FairPoint, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and has been prepared to reflect the Merger, based on
the acquisition method of accounting, with Consolidated treated as the acquirer. The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events
that are directly attributable to the Merger and factually supportable and, in the case of the statement of income, that are expected to have a continuing impact.

        The summary pro forma financial information is derived from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
See the section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" on page 119. The summary pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction
with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Consolidated and FairPoint, incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income, which have been prepared for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, give effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet has been prepared as of September 30, 2016 and gives effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on that date.

        As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Consolidated has not finalized the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required fair market value of the
FairPoint assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of the purchase price nor has it identified all adjustments necessary to conform FairPoint to
Consolidated's accounting policies. Consolidated has made certain pro forma adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of FairPoint to reflect certain
preliminary estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired, with the excess of the estimated purchase price over the estimated fair values of FairPoint's acquired assets and assumed
liabilities recorded as goodwill. See Note 2 to the section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" on page 119. Actual results are expected to differ
from these preliminary estimates once Consolidated has determined the final purchase price (as determined by the market price of Consolidated common stock on the closing date of the
Merger) for FairPoint, has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any necessary conforming accounting policy
accounting changes for FairPoint. There can be no assurances that such finalization will not result in material changes.

        The summary pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the combined company
that would have been reported had the Merger been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or
financial condition of the combined company.

        Upon completion of the Merger, various triggering events will have occurred which result in cash payments to certain FairPoint employees under various employment and
severance in connection with a change in control agreements. The estimated payments under these agreements will range from approximately $7.0 million to $9.0 million and have been
included as a pro forma adjustment in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. No adjustment has been included in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statements of income for these payments because they are considered to be of a non-recurring nature.

        The summary pro forma financial information does not include the realization of future cost savings or synergies or costs or restructuring charges that are expected to result from
Consolidated's acquisition of FairPoint. The transaction is expected to generate annual operating synergies of approximately $55.0 million, which are expected to be achieved on a run-
rate basis by the end of the second year after close. However, no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate amount of such synergies or the timing of their realization.
Consolidated also expects to incur merger and integration costs over the first two years following the close.

Merger was completed on either of these dates, applying the exchange ratio of 0.7300 shares of Consolidated common stock for each share of FairPoint common stock.

        The market value of the Consolidated common stock to be issued in exchange for shares of FairPoint common stock upon the completion of the Merger will not be known at the
time of the FairPoint special meeting. The above tables show only historical comparisons. Because the market prices of Consolidated common stock and FairPoint common stock will
likely fluctuate prior to the Merger, these comparisons may not provide meaningful information to FairPoint's stockholders in determining whether to adopt the Merger Agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby. Stockholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Consolidated common stock and FairPoint common stock and to
review carefully the other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 151.

        No assurance can be given as to the market price of Consolidated common stock or the market price of FairPoint common stock at the effective time of the Merger. The
market price of Consolidated common stock will continue to fluctuate after the effective time of the Merger. See the section entitled "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger" on
page 35.

        The following table sets forth for the period presented certain per share information for Consolidated common stock and FairPoint common stock on a historical basis and on an
unaudited pro forma basis after giving effect to the Merger under the acquisition method of accounting. The historical per share information for Consolidated and FairPoint has been
derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements of Consolidated and FairPoint incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 151. The Consolidated unaudited pro forma combined per share information has been
derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the
section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" on page 119.

        The unaudited pro forma FairPoint equivalent information was calculated by multiplying the corresponding Consolidated unaudited pro forma combined information by 0.7300,
which is the exchange ratio for the stock consideration in the pro forma condensed combined financial statements. See Note 2 in the "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Statements" on page 123. This data shows how each share of FairPoint common stock that is converted in the Merger into shares of Consolidated common stock would have
participated in income from continuing operations, cash dividends declared and book value of Consolidated if FairPoint and Consolidated had been combined for accounting and
financial reporting purposes for the period presented. These amounts, however, are

        Consolidated expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $1.5495 per share during 2017 but only if and to the extent declared by the Consolidated Board and
subject to various restrictions on Consolidated's ability to do so. Dividends on Consolidated common stock are not cumulative.

        FairPoint does not currently pay a quarterly dividend and is prohibited pursuant to the Merger Agreement from making, declaring or paying any dividend without the prior consent
of Consolidated.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

        On December 6, 2016, Consolidated completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its Enterprise Services equipment and IT Services business ("EIS") to ePlus Technology, inc.
("ePlus") for cash proceeds of $9.2 million net of a customary working capital adjustment. As part of the transaction, Consolidated entered into a Co-Marketing Agreement with ePlus, a
nationwide systems integrator of technology solutions, to cross-sell both broadband network services and IT services. The strategic partnership will provide Consolidated's business customers
access to a broader suite of IT solutions, and will also provide ePlus customers access to Consolidated's business network services.

RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER 

        In addition to the other information included in and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, FairPoint's stockholders should consider carefully the matters
described below in determining whether to approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal and Consolidated's stockholders should consider carefully the matters described below in determining
whether to approve the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal. Please also refer to the information under the heading "Risk Factors" set forth in Item 1A in each of Consolidated's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and FairPoint's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as amended and as updated by
subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, each of which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
Information" on page 151.

The price of Consolidated common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of FairPoint common stock.

        Upon completion of the Merger, holders of FairPoint common stock will become Consolidated's stockholders. Consolidated's business and results of operations and the market price of
Consolidated common stock may be affected by factors different than those affecting FairPoint's business and results of operations and the market price of FairPoint common stock. For a
discussion of Consolidated's and FairPoint's businesses and certain factors to consider in connection with their businesses, see the periodic reports and other documents of Consolidated and
FairPoint incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus and listed under the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 151.

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might be willing to pay more to effect a business combination with FairPoint.

        The Merger Agreement contains "no solicitation" provisions that restrict FairPoint's ability to solicit or facilitate proposals regarding a merger or similar transaction with another party.
Further, several conditions must be satisfied in order for the FairPoint Board to withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation regarding the proposed Merger, including that Consolidated
generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the proposed Merger in response to any competing acquisition proposal that may be made before the FairPoint Board may
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation regarding the proposed Merger. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Changes in Recommendations" on page
105. If the FairPoint Board withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation regarding the proposed Merger, Consolidated has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive an
$18.9 million termination fee from FairPoint. These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror from considering or proposing an acquisition of FairPoint, even if it were
prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the shares proposed to be issued in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price
than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.

A lawsuit has been filed against FairPoint, the members of the FairPoint Board, Consolidated and Merger Sub challenging the Merger and any adverse judgment in such lawsuit, or any
other lawsuits that may be filed challenging the Merger, may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.

        FairPoint, the members of the FairPoint Board, Consolidated and Merger Sub have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a purported stockholder of FairPoint challenging the
Merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms or to rescind the Merger if it is completed, in addition to damages.

alleges, among other things, that the disclosures in the Form S-4 Registration Statement (of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part) filed by Consolidated with the SEC on
January 26, 2017 are materially incomplete and misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

        FairPoint's and/or Consolidated's stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger, which may name FairPoint, Consolidated, members of the FairPoint Board, members
of the Consolidated Board and/or Merger Sub as defendants. Neither FairPoint nor Consolidated can assure you as to the outcome of such lawsuits, including the amount of costs associated
with defending any such claim or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of any such claim. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is the absence
of any order, injunction or other legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that prevents the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, if any plaintiff in
any lawsuit is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, such an injunction may delay the consummation of the
Merger in the expected timeframe, or may prevent the Merger from being consummated altogether. Whether or not any plaintiff's claim would be successful, this type of litigation may result in
significant costs and may divert FairPoint's and/or Consolidated's management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of FairPoint's and/or Consolidated's
respective businesses. See the section entitled "The Merger—Legal Proceedings Related to the Merger" on page 95.

The integration of Consolidated and FairPoint following the Merger may present significant challenges.

        Consolidated may face significant challenges in combining FairPoint's operations into its operations in a timely and efficient manner and in retaining key FairPoint personnel. The failure
to successfully integrate Consolidated and FairPoint and to successfully manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in Consolidated not achieving the anticipated
benefits of the Merger including operational and financial synergies.

Restrictions in Consolidated's debt agreements may prevent Consolidated from paying dividends.

        Consolidated's ability to pay dividends will be restricted by current and future agreements governing its debt, including its current credit agreement, its current indenture governing its
senior notes and the financing agreements expected to be in place upon consummation of the Merger. See the section entitled "Debt Financing" on page 117. Consolidated expects that, giving
pro forma effect to the Merger and related transactions, including its new incremental term loan facility, as of September 30, 2016, it would have been able to pay aggregate dividends under
Consolidated's credit agreement of $350.6 million on the approximately 71.9 million shares of Consolidated common stock expected to be outstanding upon consummation of the Merger.

Consolidated will have a substantial amount of debt outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could restrict Consolidated's ability to pay dividends and fund
working capital and planned capital expenditures.

        As of September 30, 2016, Consolidated had $1.4 billion of long-term debt and $17.1 million of capital leases outstanding along with $211.5 million of stockholders' equity. It will incur
additional debt in the approximate amount of $935.0 million, which excludes debt discount, in order to complete the Merger and repay and redeem FairPoint's debt. This amount of leverage
could have important consequences, including:

• Consolidated may be required to use a substantial portion of Consolidated's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on Consolidated's debt, which will reduce
funds available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends;

Table of Contents

• Consolidated may have limited flexibility to react to changes in Consolidated's business and its industry; 

• it may be more difficult for Consolidated to satisfy its other obligations; 

• Consolidated may have a limited ability to borrow additional funds or to sell assets to raise funds if needed for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other
purposes; 

• Consolidated may become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates; and 

• Consolidated may be at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.

        Consolidated currently expects its cash interest expense to be approximately $105.0 million to $110.0 million in fiscal year 2017 assuming consummation of the Merger by September 30,
2017. Future interest expense will be higher than historic interest expense as a result of higher levels of indebtedness incurred to consummate the Merger. Consolidated's ability to make
payments on its debt and to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future, which will depend on many factors beyond its control. Consolidated
cannot assure you that:

• its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service and repay its debt, pay dividends on its common stock and fund working capital and planned capital
expenditures; 

• future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or any future credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its debt and pay dividends on its common
stock; or 

• it will be able to refinance any of its debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

        If Consolidated cannot generate sufficient cash from its operations to meet its debt service obligations, Consolidated may need to reduce or delay capital expenditures, the development of
its business generally and any acquisitions. If Consolidated becomes unable to meet its debt service and repayment obligations, Consolidated would be in default under the terms of its credit
agreement and the indenture governing its senior notes, which would allow its lenders and noteholders to declare all outstanding borrowings to be due and payable. If the amounts outstanding
under its credit facilities and senior notes indenture were to be accelerated, Consolidated cannot assure you that its assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed.

The opinions obtained by the Consolidated Board and the FairPoint Board from their respective financial advisors do not and will not reflect changes in circumstances after the date of
such opinions.

        The Consolidated Board received a written opinion dated December 3, 2016 from its financial advisor that the exchange ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to Consolidated, and the FairPoint Board received a written opinion dated December 3, 2016 from its financial advisor that the exchange ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of FairPoint common stock. Each opinion was given as of its date, and based on and subject to the various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken as set forth in the respective written opinion. Changes in the operations or
prospects of Consolidated or FairPoint, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Consolidated and FairPoint, and on which the above-
described opinions were based, may alter the value of Consolidated or FairPoint or the prices of shares of Consolidated common stock or FairPoint common stock by the time the combination
is completed. Consolidated and FairPoint have not obtained, and do not expect to request, updated opinions from their respective financial advisors. Neither of the above-listed opinions speak
to any date other than the date of such opinion. For a more complete description of the above-described opinions, please refer to the sections entitled "The

Merger—Opinion of Financial Advisor to FairPoint" and "The Merger—Opinion of Financial Advisor to Consolidated" on pages 60 and 75, respectively.

Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the Merger and/or result in the incurrence of additional costs.

        The Merger is currently expected to close by the middle of 2017, assuming that all of the conditions in the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived. Certain events may delay the
completion of the Merger or result in a termination of the Merger Agreement. Some of these events are outside the control of either party. Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon
FairPoint's stockholders approving, at the FairPoint special meeting, the FairPoint Merger Proposal and Consolidated's stockholders approving, at the Consolidated special meeting, the
Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal. If the stockholders of FairPoint or Consolidated do not approve these matters at their respective meetings, the Merger will not be consummated.
Completion of the Merger is also conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of certain governmental consents and regulatory approvals of the change in control transaction and/or the
guarantee and pledge of stock or assets of certain regulated subsidiaries of FairPoint, including approval by the FCC and the Colorado PUC, the Georgia PSC, the Illinois CC, the Kansas CC,
the Maine PUC, the New Hampshire PUC, the New York PSC, the Ohio PUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, the Vermont PSB, the Virginia SCC and filing notices with the Alabama PSC, the
Florida PSC, the Massachusetts DPU, the Missouri PSC, the Oklahoma CC and the Washington UTC. Certain other state and municipal franchise authority approvals and notices may also be
required in connection with the transfer of control of cable and internet protocol television franchises held by subsidiaries of FairPoint. While Consolidated and FairPoint intend to pursue
vigorously all required consents and approvals and do not know of any reason why they would not be able to obtain them in a timely manner, the requirement to obtain these consents and
approvals prior to completion of the Merger could jeopardize or delay completion of the Merger, possibly for a significant period of time after FairPoint's stockholders have approved the
FairPoint Merger Proposal and Consolidated's stockholders have approved the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal. Further, these consents and approvals may impose conditions on or
require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations or assets of Consolidated or FairPoint. Such conditions or divestitures may further jeopardize or delay completion of the Merger or may
reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger.

        No assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied. Even if all such consents and approvals are
obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement. See the sections entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Conditions of the Merger" for a discussion of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, "The Merger Agreement—Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
Complete the Merger; Other Agreements" for a discussion of the parties' obligations to cooperate (including certain limitations thereon) with respect to the receipt of such consents and
approvals, and "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger" for a description of the regulatory approvals necessary in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not
completed by September 30, 2017, or such later date determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, either FairPoint or Consolidated may terminate the Merger Agreement (provided
that the party terminating the Merger Agreement has not materially contributed to the failure to fulfill any condition under the Merger Agreement). See the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees; Expenses" on page 112.

        FairPoint and/or Consolidated may incur significant additional costs and expenses, including those under the Incremental Term Loan Facility being used by Consolidated to partially fund
the Merger, in connection with any delay in completing the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement,

including significant additional transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting and other costs we have already incurred.

Consolidated will incur transaction, integration and restructuring costs in connection with the Merger.

        Consolidated and FairPoint expect to incur costs associated with transaction fees and other costs related to the Merger. Specifically, Consolidated and FairPoint expect to incur
approximately $64.1 million of transaction costs related to the Merger. In addition, Consolidated will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the Merger as it
integrates the businesses of FairPoint with those of Consolidated. Although Consolidated expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset
incremental transaction, integration and restructuring costs over time, Consolidated cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all.

FairPoint's stockholders will have ownership and voting interests in Consolidated after the Merger lower than they did in FairPoint and will exercise less influence over management of
Consolidated than they currently exercise over management of FairPoint.

        After the effective time of the Merger, FairPoint's stockholders who receive stock consideration in the Merger will own in the aggregate a significantly smaller percentage of Consolidated
than they currently own of FairPoint. Immediately following the Merger, those stockholders are expected to own approximately 29.9% of the outstanding shares of Consolidated common
stock, based on the number of shares of FairPoint common stock and Consolidated common stock outstanding as of February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. Consequently, FairPoint's stockholders, as a general matter, will have less influence over the management and policies of Consolidated than they currently
exercise over the management and policies of FairPoint.

The shares of Consolidated common stock to be received by FairPoint's stockholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the shares of FairPoint common stock.

        FairPoint's stockholders' rights are currently governed by the FairPoint certificate of incorporation and the FairPoint bylaws. FairPoint's stockholders will, upon completion of the Merger,
become stockholders of Consolidated, and their rights will be governed by the Consolidated certificate of incorporation and the Consolidated bylaws. See the section entitled "Comparison of
Rights of Common Stockholders of FairPoint and Common Stockholders of Consolidated" on page 131.

Certain directors and executive officers of FairPoint may have potential conflicts of interest with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement.

        Some of FairPoint's directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of FairPoint's stockholders generally. Consolidated has
agreed to elect one director selected from the FairPoint Board and approved by Consolidated (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) to serve on the
Consolidated Board after the consummation of the Merger, and will take all actions necessary to appoint such individual to the Consolidated Board and to cause the authorized size of the
Consolidated Board to increase as of immediately following the Merger. Although other FairPoint directors will not become directors of Consolidated after the Merger, Consolidated will
indemnify and maintain liability insurance for all of the officers and directors of FairPoint for their services as directors or officers before the Merger. In addition, certain of the executive
officers of FairPoint are party to employment agreements that require FairPoint and its successors and assigns to indemnify such officers and entitle each such executive officer to enhanced
severance if his or her employment were to terminate following the Merger under specific circumstances. The Merger Agreement also provides that equity awards held by FairPoint

executive officers will accelerate and be converted to Consolidated common stock in connection with the Merger. Stock options held by FairPoint's named executive officers are receiving the
same treatment as all other outstanding stock options held by FairPoint's employees. See the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of FairPoint Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger" on page 85 for a discussion of these interests.

Whether or not the Merger is completed, the pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in the businesses of FairPoint and Consolidated, which could have an adverse effect on
their businesses and financial results.

        The pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of FairPoint and Consolidated, including, but not limited to, the following:

• current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company or consider other employment alternatives, which might
adversely affect FairPoint's and Consolidated's ability to retain or attract key managers and other employees; 

• current and prospective customers of FairPoint or Consolidated may experience variations in levels of services as the companies prepare for integration or may anticipate
change in how they are served and may, as a result, choose to discontinue their service with either company or choose another provider; and 

• the attention of management of each of FairPoint and Consolidated may be diverted from the operation of the businesses toward the completion of the Merger.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be viewed as a forecast of Consolidated's financial condition or results of
operations following the Merger.

        The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been derived from the historical financial statements of Consolidated and FairPoint and certain adjustments and assumptions have been
made regarding Consolidated after giving effect to the Merger. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and these kinds of adjustments
and assumptions are difficult to make with complete accuracy. Moreover, the unaudited pro forma financial statements do not reflect all costs that are expected to be incurred or savings to be
achieved by Consolidated in connection with the Merger. For example, neither the impact of any incremental costs incurred in integrating the two companies, nor any potential cost savings is
reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial statements. As a result, the actual financial condition and results of operations of Consolidated following the Merger will likely not be consistent
with, or evident from, these unaudited pro forma financial statements. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma financial information may not prove to be
accurate, and other factors may affect Consolidated's financial conditions or results of operations following the Merger. Therefore, stockholders of Consolidated and stockholders of FairPoint
should not place undue reliance on the pro forma financial statements when deciding whether to vote for their respective proposals relating to the Merger. See the section entitled "Summary
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" on page 29.

Any delay in the completion of the Merger may significantly reduce the benefits expected to be obtained from the Merger or could adversely affect the market price of Consolidated or
FairPoint common stock or their future business and financial results.

        In addition to the required regulatory clearances and approvals, the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions, including approvals of Consolidated's stockholders and FairPoint's
stockholders, that are beyond the control of Consolidated and FairPoint and that may prevent, delay or otherwise

materially and adversely affect completion of the Merger. Consolidated and FairPoint cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied.

Completion of the Merger, the failure to complete the Merger and delays completing the Merger could result in a significant adverse change in the market price of the Consolidated
and/or FairPoint common stock.

        Failure to complete the Merger would prevent Consolidated and FairPoint from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Each company would also remain liable for significant
transaction costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. Any delay in completing the Merger may significantly reduce the synergies and other benefits that Consolidated
expects to achieve if it successfully completes the Merger within the expected timeframe and integrates the businesses. In addition, the market price of each company's common stock may
reflect various market assumptions as to whether and when the Merger will be completed. Consequently, the completion of, the failure to complete, or any delay in the completion of the
Merger could result in a significant adverse change in the market price of Consolidated and/or FairPoint common stock, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market
assumption that the Merger will be completed.

        A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of Consolidated and/or FairPoint in the investment community. Further, any disruptions to either parties'
business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with their respective customers, suppliers and employees, could
continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Consolidated or FairPoint may be required to pay a termination fee of $18.9 million under
certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        In addition, Consolidated and FairPoint have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transition costs in connection with
the Merger. Each of the parties will be required to pay such costs relating to the transaction whether or not the Merger is consummated.

THE MERGER 

The Companies 

Consolidated

        Consolidated, a Delaware holding company, together with its operating subsidiaries, is based in Mattoon, Illinois and is a leading business and broadband communications provider
throughout its 11-state service area. Consolidated was founded in 1894 as the Mattoon Telephone Company by the great-grandfather of one of the members of the Consolidated Board, Richard
A. Lumpkin. After several acquisitions, the Mattoon Telephone Company was incorporated as the Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company ("ICTC") on April 10, 1924. Consolidated was
incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2002, and, through its predecessors, Consolidated has provided telecommunications services for more than a century. Through strategic acquisitions
over the last decade, Consolidated has grown its business, diversified its revenue and cash flow streams and created a strong platform for future growth. Consolidated's strategic approach in
evaluating potential transactions include analysis of the market, the quality of the network, Consolidated's ability to integrate the acquired company efficiently, the potential for creating
significant operating synergies and a positive cash flow at the inception of each acquisition. The operating synergies are created through the use of consistent platforms, convergence of
processes and functional management of the combined entities. Consolidated measures its synergies during the first two years following an acquisition. For example, the acquisition of
Consolidated's Texas properties in 2004 tripled the size of Consolidated's business and gave Consolidated the requisite scale to make system and platform decisions that would facilitate future
acquisitions. For the acquisition of Consolidated's Pennsylvania properties in 2007, Consolidated achieved synergies in excess of $12.0 million in annualized savings, which at the time,
represented about 20% of its operating expense. For Consolidated's acquisition of SureWest Communications in 2012, Consolidated achieved synergies in excess of 10% more than the
originally projected amount of $25.0 million. For Consolidated's acquisition of Enventis Corporation in October 2014, Consolidated achieved annual operating synergies of approximately
$17.0 million, which exceeded the original estimate in excess of 20%. Consolidated has positioned its business to provide services in both rural and suburban markets with service territories
spanning the country.

        Consolidated leverages its advanced fiber optic network and multiple data centers to provide reliable, high-quality communication solutions including: high-speed internet, digital TV,
data, phone, managed services, a comprehensive suite of cloud services and wireless backhaul. Consolidated is dedicated to turning technology into solutions, connecting people and enriching
how its customers work and live.

FairPoint

        FairPoint, a Delaware corporation, provides advanced data, voice and video technologies to single and multi-site businesses, public and private institutions, consumers, wireless
companies and wholesale re-sellers in 17 states. Leveraging an owned, fiber-based Ethernet network—with more than 21,000 route miles of fiber, including approximately 17,000 route miles
of fiber in northern New England—FairPoint has the network coverage, scalable bandwidth and transport capacity to support enhanced applications, including the next generation of mobile
and cloud-based communications, such as small cell wireless backhaul technology, voice over IP, data center colocation services, managed services and disaster recovery.

Falcon Merger Sub, Inc.

        Merger Sub is a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated. It was incorporated on December 1, 2016 solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger with
FairPoint, pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Background of the Merger 

        Early in 2015, Paul Sunu, President and Chief Executive Officer of FairPoint, engaged in discussions with representatives of a number of industry players, including Consolidated. These
discussions related to the possibility of pursuing various transactions that could be transformative for FairPoint, including acquisitions and joint ventures. The parties expressed varying levels
of interest, but no party was prepared to pursue formal discussions at that time.

        On May 13, 2015, Mr. Sunu attended a dinner meeting with representatives of another industry player ("Party [A]"), along with FairPoint Board member Michael Robinson, to discuss a
potential transaction. The representatives conveyed that they would not be in a position to consider any transaction in the near term.

        On May 21, 2015, Mr. Sunu attended a dinner meeting with Bob Currey, Executive Chairman, and Bob Udell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Consolidated, in Chicago, Illinois.
Mr. Currey and Mr. Udell indicated that they would be interested in considering a transaction. Mr. Currey and Mr. Udell also noted that if a transaction were to move forward, the consideration
would likely consist mostly of stock, with some cash consideration.

        On May 26, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with a representative of another industry player ("Party [B]"), in New York, New York. The representative indicated a certain level of interest in
considering a transaction.

        At a meeting held on May 27, 2015, the FairPoint Board determined that it would be in the best interest of FairPoint and its stockholders to explore transformative transactions for the
company (sale or purchase) by working with an advisor. The FairPoint Board selected Evercore to work with management to review strategic alternatives.

        FairPoint's regular outside counsel Paul Hastings LLP ("Paul Hastings") was asked to assist in this process, including by advising the FairPoint Board on matters such as the FairPoint
Board's fiduciary duty obligations with respect to potential transactions.

        On June 9, 2015, Mr. Sunu had a telephone conversation with Mr. Currey where Mr. Currey guided Mr. Sunu to work directly with Mr. Udell. On June 12, 2015, the FairPoint Board
(except Mr. Gingold and Mr. Mahoney) met telephonically for an update regarding the various strategic transaction discussions. Members of FairPoint's management team were also in
attendance. On June 19, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with a representative of Party [B], who concluded there could be value to discussing a potential transaction and indicated that Party [B] would be
willing to engage investment bankers to assist in any discussions.

        On June 20, 2015, Mr. Sunu and Mr. Udell met and agreed to pursue further discussions to explore the opportunity.

        On June 23, 2015, the FairPoint Board, except Mr. Austin, met telephonically for an update regarding the various strategic transaction discussions. Members of FairPoint's management
team and representatives of Evercore were also in attendance. Representatives of Evercore provided an updated review of potential strategic alternatives and next steps.

        On July 1, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with a representative of one of the potential strategic partners, with whom he had met in early 2015 ("Party [D]"), in New York, New York to discuss
potential merger opportunities.

        On July 14, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with representatives of Party [B] in New York, New York. They agreed to hold an additional meeting within the next week.

        On July 15, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with a representative of one of the potential strategic partners Mr. Sunu had met with in early 2015 ("Party [C]"), in Charlotte, North Carolina. The
representative indicated to Mr. Sunu that Party [C] did not think it was the right time to consider a transaction.

        Also on July 15, 2015, FairPoint entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Consolidated.

        On July 16, 2015, the FairPoint Board met telephonically for an update regarding the various strategic transaction discussions. Members of FairPoint's management team and
representatives of Evercore were also in attendance. Representatives of Evercore provided an updated review of potential strategic alternatives and industry developments since the last
meeting of the FairPoint Board. Representatives of Evercore and Mr. Sunu reported on the schedule of proposed meetings and conversations to take place over the next several weeks, noting
that FairPoint would enter into confidentiality agreements before those meetings as appropriate. Representatives of Evercore then provided the FairPoint Board with a review of a presentation
to be used in future meetings with potential strategic partners.

        On July 17, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with representatives of Party [D], communicating FairPoint's interest in a potential transaction. They noted that they were willing to engage in discussions
to determine if any transaction was feasible. They also discussed entering into a non-disclosure agreement so that the parties could begin to share information.

        On July 20, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with Mr. Udell and Steve Childers, the Chief Financial Officer of Consolidated, in Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Sunu, Ajay Sabherwal, then Chief Financial
Officer of FairPoint, Karen Turner, then Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Support of FairPoint, and representatives of Evercore made a presentation regarding FairPoint and
suggested as a next step that Consolidated should consider delivering an indication of interest for consideration by FairPoint.

        On July 22, 2015, Mr. Sunu met with representatives of Party [B], along with representatives of their financial advisors. Mr. Sunu, Mr. Sabherwal, Ms. Turner, Shirley Linn, then General
Counsel of FairPoint, and representatives of Evercore made a presentation regarding FairPoint. They asked for an opportunity to review the materials in detail and create a model, and follow
up with questions at a later date. Party [B] indicated that they were considering a range of alternatives to engage in a transaction with FairPoint.

        On July 27, 2015, Mr. Sunu had a telephone conversation with Mr. Udell, where Mr. Udell indicated that FairPoint's and Consolidated's strategies were more aligned than he initially had
thought. Mr. Udell said that he would like to continue to explore a potential transaction, and they discussed organizing joint meetings of subject matter experts from both entities. Mr. Udell
told Mr. Sunu that Consolidated would be engaging Morgan Stanley in connection with the discussions and suggested that Morgan Stanley and Evercore coordinate a meeting between the
parties. Evercore and Morgan Stanley coordinated and facilitated the sharing of information in advance of the August 4, 2015 meeting.

        On July 31, 2015, Mr. Sunu and a representative of Party [B] spoke by telephone. On the call, the representative indicated that a total acquisition of FairPoint would be difficult, but
indicated considering other business transactions with FairPoint.

        On August 4, 2015, Steve Shirar, the Chief Information Officer and Corporate Secretary of Consolidated, Tom White, the Chief Technology Officer of Consolidated, and Michael Smith,
the Chief Marketing Officer of Consolidated, met with Tony Tomae, FairPoint's Chief Revenue Officer, Mr. Sabherwal, John Lunny, FairPoint's Chief Technology Officer, and Ms. Turner.
Also in attendance were representatives from Morgan Stanley and Evercore. FairPoint's representatives provided an overview of FairPoint, after which there were breakout sessions to discuss
FairPoint's revenue and technology.

        On August 31, 2015, Mr. Sunu and members of FairPoint's management team met with representatives of one of the potential strategic partners with whom Mr. Sunu had met in early
2015 ("Party [E]"), to discuss operational issues. Subsequently, the CEO of Party [E] called Mr. Sunu to express interest in evaluating a potential combination between the two companies.
Party [E]'s CEO and Mr. Sunu agreed to a future meeting.

value for 100% of the outstanding shares of FairPoint stock. The letter stated that Consolidated would consider providing consideration in cash for up to 25% of the purchase price with the
remainder in common stock, which would result in FairPoint's stockholders owning approximately 25 to 30% of the equity of Consolidated.

        On October 8, 2015, the FairPoint Board met telephonically with representatives from Evercore and members of FairPoint's management team. At the meeting, representatives of

of $19.00 per share. The consideration would take the form of a cash component of $4.75 per share (or 25% of the total consideration) and the remainder would be paid in Consolidated
common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.6718 of a Consolidated share for every one share of FairPoint. The transaction would result in FairPoint's stockholders owning 26.7% of the
equity in Consolidated. FairPoint's stockholders would also receive the opportunity to nominate one director to the Consolidated Board, subject to a mutually agreeable selection mechanism.
The transaction would be financed by a combination of secured and unsecured debt. Also on November 9, 2015, the FairPoint Board met with representatives of Paul Hastings and Evercore to
discuss the second letter of interest from Consolidated. At the meeting, Evercore presented the key terms of the offer and reviewed the potential transaction.

        On November 10, 2015, representatives of Evercore called representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss FairPoint's potential counter proposal to Consolidated's second letter of interest.
On the same day, at the direction of the FairPoint Board, Evercore sent a written counter proposal to Mr. Udell, Mr. Childers and representatives of Morgan Stanley. FairPoint proposed that
Consolidated acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of FairPoint for total consideration of $21.50 per share. The consideration would take the form of a cash component of $5.38 per
share (or 25% of the total consideration) and the remainder in the form of newly issued common stock of Consolidated using a 0.7792x exchange ratio (based on Consolidated's 30-day VWAP
of $20.69 as of November 10, 2015), representing $16.12 per share. The transaction would result in FairPoint's stockholders owning 29.7% of the equity in Consolidated. Additionally,
FairPoint's stockholders would receive the opportunity to nominate two directors to the Consolidated Board, subject to a mutually agreeable selection mechanism. FairPoint also proposed that
there would be neither financing conditions nor an exclusivity period. No other material changes were proposed in the counter proposal.

in a combination of cash and stock, and a termination fee of $25,000,000 payable by FairPoint in the event that the transaction did not close.

        On November 23, 2015, representatives of Consolidated's and FairPoint's management teams met in Manchester to conduct additional due diligence.

FairPoint provided a confidential, non-binding letter of interest to Party [C]. The non-binding letter of interest contemplated a purchase of Party [C] by FairPoint.

        On December 23, 2015, representatives of Schiff Hardin provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Paul Hastings and FairPoint. The revised draft accepted
few of the requested changes and eliminated most of the additional representations, warranties and covenants of Consolidated proposed in the last draft circulated by Paul Hastings, as well as
the revisions to the "deal protection" provisions, including deletion of the reverse termination fee payable by Consolidated and an increase of the termination fee payable by FairPoint from 2%
to 3.5% of the transaction value.

        On December 30, 2015, representatives of Paul Hastings communicated with representatives of Schiff Hardin by email to outline certain issues presented by the current draft of the merger
agreement. Schiff Hardin's representatives responded that they had been directed by Consolidated not to continue to try to work through the issues as Consolidated did not see a transaction as a
possibility at that time in light of adverse conditions in the capital markets. Consolidated then confirmed to FairPoint that discussions were terminated.

        On January 8, 2016, Mr. Sunu had a telephone conversation with a representative of Party [C]. The representative indicated that FairPoint's letter had been discussed with the senior
management team, the Chairman and the board of directors of Party [C]. Party [C] had also engaged an investment bank and legal counsel in connection with the proposed transaction. The
representative indicated that although the offer set forth in the letter was not compelling as drafted, Party [C] would like for the respective advisors to discuss the proposed structure and other
potential deal terms in order to present the potential transaction to Party [C]'s board of directors. Mr. Sunu noted that the proposal was based on public information that was initially available,
and that FairPoint would be open to adjusting the proposal with additional information.

        On January 14, 2016, Mr. Sunu had a telephone conversation with a representative of Party [C], in which that representative noted that it was advisable to connect the companies'

transactions and to recommend that FairPoint's stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger proposal (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):

Positive Factors Relating to the Merger

Factors Relating to the Transaction Generally

• The FairPoint Board determined that the Merger Consideration to be paid per share of FairPoint common stock of 0.7300 shares of Consolidated common stock, together with
the potential value creation from the combination of the two companies, is more favorable to FairPoint's stockholders than the potential value that might result from other
alternatives reasonably available to FairPoint, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of FairPoint on a stand-alone basis, in light of a number of factors, including
the following: 

• the benefits, potential risks and uncertainties associated with the Merger as compared to those of other potential strategic alternatives that might be available to
FairPoint, as well as those of remaining as a stand-alone entity, in the context of FairPoint's business, assets and prospects, its historical and projected financial
performance and the opportunities and challenges facing FairPoint and its industry, as well as broader economic developments affecting its businesses; 

• the strategic and other alternatives reasonably available to FairPoint as determined through FairPoint's strategic alternatives review process, including the alternative of
remaining a stand-alone public company, in light of a number of factors and the potential risks and uncertainties associated with those alternatives, none of which other
alternatives was deemed likely to result in value to FairPoint's stockholders that would meet or exceed, on a present-value basis, the value of the Merger Consideration; 

• Consolidated was one of the most logical strategic partners in a consolidating industry in light of its complementary products and strategic position and the potential for
the realization of synergies, such that a business combination transaction with Consolidated was most likely to provide significant long-term value to FairPoint's
stockholders; and 

• the FairPoint Board's view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would not preclude or otherwise limit any third party with the financial capability and strategic
interest of acquiring FairPoint from pursuing a potential superior proposal. 

• The Merger would provide FairPoint stockholders with an implied ownership in the combined company of approximately 29%, thereby allowing FairPoint stockholders the
opportunity to participate in the future performance of the combined company, including synergies resulting from the Merger; 

• Consolidated management's estimate that the Merger is expected create approximately $55 million in annual operating expense synergies, and from which FairPoint's
stockholders would benefit as continuing stockholders; 

• The expectation that the combined company would benefit from utilization of FairPoint's accumulated net operating losses of approximately $295 million as of September 2016
after the closing of the Merger; 

• FairPoint has established a solid operating platform, and the combined company could use this platform to deliver a broader range of services and advanced communications
solutions to meet customer demands; 

• FairPoint's operating platform would not require any operating systems conversions or cut-overs as a result of the closing of the Merger;

• The combined company would benefit from economies of scale which would provide the combined company with greater purchasing power and expectation of earlier access to
new technologies and solutions; 

• The Merger would result in an extensive fiber rich footprint spanning over 31,000 fiber route miles and operate in 24 states; and 

• The combined company would be a financially stronger company than FairPoint as a standalone company before the Merger, benefiting from a more diverse revenue base and
an increase in free cash flow.

Consolidated's Business, Operating Results, Financial Condition and Management

        The business, operating results and financial condition of Consolidated, on both a historical and prospective basis, and the quality, breadth and experience of Consolidated's senior
management, including:

• Consistent with Consolidated's current dividend practice, that the Consolidated Board expects to maintain its annual dividend of $1.55 per share after the closing of the Merger; 

• Consolidated's successful history of integrating previous acquisitions; 

• The results of the due diligence review performed on Consolidated by FairPoint's management and financial and legal advisors regarding Consolidated's assets, financial
condition, results of operations, business plan and prospects, including the size, scale, competitive position, and prospects of the combined company; 

• The alignment between FairPoint's and Consolidated's strategic vision; and 

• The focus on business and broadband growth initiatives of Consolidated's management.

Merger Consideration

• The Merger Consideration to be paid per share of FairPoint common stock consists of 0.7300 shares of Consolidated common stock, which represents a 17.3% premium to the
average exchange ratio of 0.6222 over the 30-business day period ended December 2, 2016 (the last trading day before the announcement); 

• Based on the fixed exchange ratio of 0.7300 shares, FairPoint stockholders would benefit from any increase in trading price of Consolidated common stock prior to completion
of the combination; 

• FairPoint stockholders would benefit from enhanced liquidity after the Merger based on the higher average daily trading volume of Consolidated common stock compared to
that of FairPoint common stock, which could provide FairPoint stockholders with the flexibility to sell their shares for cash in a more liquid market; and 

• The oral opinion followed by a confirming written opinion of Evercore, dated December 3, 2016, delivered to the FairPoint Board to the effect that, as December 3, 2016 and
based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of FairPoint common stock, as more fully described below in the section entitled "—Opinion of Financial Advisor to Fairpoint."

Terms of the Merger Agreement

        The FairPoint Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in addition to the exchange ratio, including the following:

• The nature of the closing conditions included in the Merger Agreement, including the exceptions to the events that would constitute a material adverse effect on FairPoint for
purposes of the agreement, as well as the likelihood that all of the conditions to the transactions would be satisfied in a timely manner; 

• The Merger Agreement does not include a financing contingency; 

• The obligation of Consolidated to take all actions necessary to arrange the financing provided for in its financing commitment and, if such financing is unavailable, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternate financing in an amount that will enable Consolidated to consummate the transaction; 

• Provisions of the Merger Agreement that would permit FairPoint, until adoption of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders, to furnish information to, and engage in
discussions and negotiations with, third parties making unsolicited acquisition proposals that the FairPoint Board determines are reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal
and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal, subject to payment to Consolidated of a termination fee of $18.9 million; 

• Provisions of the Merger Agreement that would permit the FairPoint Board, at any time prior to obtaining FairPoint's stockholder approval, if FairPoint is then in receipt of a
bona fide written alternative proposal that the FairPoint Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a
superior proposal or if there occurs any fiduciary change, to effect a change in its recommendation to the stockholders and/or recommend a superior proposal, subject to
payment to Consolidated of a termination fee of $18.9 million; 

• The FairPoint Board determined the amount of the termination fee to be reasonable in light of, among other factors, the benefits of the Merger to FairPoint's stockholders, the
advice of its legal and financial advisors that the percentage of equity value it represented is consistent with such percentage in comparable business combination transactions,
and the likelihood that an obligation to make a payment of such an amount would not preclude other acquisition proposals (the likelihood of which the board discussed with its
financial and legal advisors); 

• The right granted in the Merger Agreement for the FairPoint Board to select a member of the Consolidated Board, subject to approval by Consolidated (such approval not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), which would provide assurance that legacy FairPoint stockholders would have a continuing voice to influence achieving the
benefits of the Merger and continuing Consolidated's current dividend practices; 

• The Merger Agreement would provide FairPoint with sufficient operating flexibility for it to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger; 

• The receipt by Consolidated of executed debt commitment letters from sources of debt financing for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the terms of such
debt financing commitments, and the reputation of the financing sources; 

• The likelihood of that the combination would be completed, based on, among other things, the terms of the Merger Agreement that would require Consolidated to pay FairPoint
$18.9 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; and

• The ability of the companies to complete the Merger on a tax-free basis for federal income tax purposes, other than with respect to cash to be received by FairPoint's
stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of Consolidated common stock.

Negative Factors Relating to the Merger

        The FairPoint Board also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties in its deliberations concerning the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not
limited to, the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• the risk that Consolidated's common stock had increased in value prior to announcement and it may decline in value following the announcement; 

• risks associated with holding shares of Consolidated common stock, including the ability of the Consolidated Board to reduce its dividend payout ratio, which may result in a
decline in the trading price of Consolidated's common stock; 

• the risk that because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the consideration to FairPoint stockholders in the Merger could fluctuate between signing of the Merger Agreement
and the closing of the Merger, including after the FairPoint stockholder meeting; 

• the risks and costs to FairPoint if the Merger is not completed, including the potential diversion of management and employee attention, potential employee attrition and the
potential effects on business and customer and supplier relationships; 

• the risks that the Merger may not be completed, or may not be completed within the period anticipated, as a result of a failure to obtain approval of the merger by the
stockholders of FairPoint or Consolidated or failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals in connection with the Merger; 

• the risk that FairPoint may not generate sufficient cash to: (i) maintain the operations of its business as previously conducted through the consummation of the Merger and (ii) to
meet the minimum cash threshold required as a condition to the closing of the Merger; 

• the risk that Consolidated will not have sufficient cash resources at the closing of the Merger to fund fully all obligations to be paid at the closing of the Merger to the extent not
funded under Consolidated's financing commitment; 

• the risk that governmental entities may impose restrictions or conditions in order to gain approval or otherwise prevent or delay the Merger in any manner that may adversely
impact the ability of the combined company to operate or realize the synergies in the amount and in the period as projected; 

• the Merger Agreement would require FairPoint to pay Consolidated $18.9 million in the case the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including a
change in the recommendation of the FairPoint Board or a termination of the Merger Agreement by FairPoint to enter into a binding agreement providing for a superior
alternative transaction, and the potential that such fee or other Merger Agreement provisions might affect the potential for FairPoint to receive alternative strategic transaction
proposals both during the pendency of the Merger as well as afterward should the Merger not be consummated; 

• the risks associated with the combined company's indebtedness and the anticipated need to refinance when such indebtedness comes due; 

• the fact that forecasts of future results of operations and synergies are estimates based on assumptions and that for these and other reasons there is a risk that anticipated
performance and/or synergies may not be realized, including the ability to utilize net operating losses;

• the risk of diverting management focus and resources from operating FairPoint's businesses, as well as other strategic opportunities, and potential disruption associated with
combining and integrating the companies; 

• the risk that FairPoint stockholders or Consolidated stockholders may fail to adopt or approve, as applicable, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of FairPoint's business prior to the completion of the Merger, which restrictions generally require FairPoint to operate its businesses in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with limited exceptions, which may delay or prevent FairPoint from undertaking business opportunities that may arise
pending completion of the Merger; and 

• various other risks associated with the combination and the businesses of FairPoint and Consolidated described under "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger" beginning on page
35.

        The FairPoint Board concluded that these potential risks and uncertainties were outweighed by the benefits that the FairPoint Board expected FairPoint and its stockholders to achieve as a
result of the Merger. The FairPoint Board realized that there can be no assurance about future results, including results considered or expected as disclosed in the foregoing reasons.

        In addition to considering the factors described above, the FairPoint Board considered that some officers and directors of FairPoint have interests in the Merger as individuals that are in
addition to, and that may be different from, the interests of FairPoint stockholders generally (see "—Interests of FairPoint Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page
85 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus).

        The above discussion of the material factors considered by the FairPoint Board in its consideration of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is not
intended to be exhaustive, but does set forth the principal factors considered by the FairPoint Board. In light of the number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with the
evaluation of the Merger, the FairPoint Board did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in
reaching its final decision. The FairPoint Board viewed its position as being based on all of the information available to it and the factors presented to and considered by it. However, some
directors may themselves have given different weight to different factors. The factors, potential risks and uncertainties contained in this explanation of FairPoint's reasons for the Merger and
other information presented in this section contain information that is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in "Special Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 42 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to FairPoint 

        In connection with the Merger, FairPoint retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor. As part of this engagement, FairPoint requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness of the
exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of common stock of FairPoint. On December 3, 2016, at a meeting of the FairPoint Board, Evercore rendered its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion that, based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its opinion, as
of such date, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of common stock of FairPoint.

        The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated as of December 3, 2016, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex II to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is

holder of shares of FairPoint common stock or Consolidated common stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore's opinion did not address the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to FairPoint, nor did it address the underlying business decision of FairPoint to engage in the
Merger.

• compared the financial performance of each of FairPoint and Consolidated and their respective stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded
companies that Evercore deemed relevant; 

• compared the financial performance of FairPoint and Consolidated and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with those of certain other transactions that Evercore
deemed relevant; 

• reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the Merger on the future financial performance of the combined company based on the projected financial data relating to
each of FairPoint and Consolidated referred to above, including the projected Synergies and other strategic benefits and the amount and timing of realization thereof, anticipated
by the management of FairPoint and the management of Consolidated to be realized from the Merger; 

• reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated December 2, 2016; and 

• performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy and completeness of all of the information
publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, and Evercore has not assumed any liability therefor. With
respect to the projected financial data relating to FairPoint and Consolidated referred to above (including the Synergies), Evercore assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the respective managements of FairPoint and Consolidated as to (i) the future financial performance of the
companies under the assumptions reflected therein and (ii) the Synergies, including the amount and timing of realization of such Synergies. Evercore expressed no view as to any projected
financial data relating to FairPoint or Consolidated or the assumptions on which they were based. Evercore relied, at FairPoint's direction, without independent verification, upon the
assessments of the management of FairPoint and the management of Consolidated as to the Synergies, including the amount and timing of the realization of such Synergies.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement
were true and correct, that the Merger will qualify as a tax free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement in all material respects and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without material waiver or
modification thereof. Evercore further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on FairPoint or the consummation of the Merger or materially reduce the benefits of the Merger
to the holders of the FairPoint common stock. Evercore also assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft Merger Agreement dated
December 2, 2016 reviewed by Evercore.

        Evercore did not make nor assume any responsibility for making any physical inspection, independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of FairPoint or Consolidated, nor
was Evercore furnished with any such inspection, valuation or appraisal, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of FairPoint or Consolidated under any state, federal or foreign
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore's opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and financial, economic,
market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date of the opinion. Subsequent developments may affect Evercore's opinion and Evercore did not undertake any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

        Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of
the shares of FairPoint common stock. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of FairPoint, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of
the officers, directors or employees of FairPoint, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the exchange ratio or otherwise.

        Evercore assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction would not vary its analysis in any material respect. Evercore's opinion did not address the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to FairPoint, nor did it address the underlying business decision of FairPoint to engage in the Merger.
Evercore's opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the FairPoint Board or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of FairPoint common
Stock or Consolidated common stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore expressed no opinion as to the price at

Summary of Material Financial Analysis

        Set forth below is a summary of the material financial and other analyses performed by Evercore and reviewed with the FairPoint Board on December 3, 2016, in connection with
rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the
results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that
it is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or before December 1, 2016, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

        The following summary of financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. These tables must be read together with the text of each summary in order to
understand fully the financial analyses. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Evercore's
financial analyses.

Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis

        Evercore performed an analysis of selected precedent transactions to compare multiples paid in other transactions to the multiple implied in the Merger. Evercore analyzed ten merger and
acquisition transactions that were announced between 2009 and 2015 involving acquisitions of rural local exchange carriers (each, an "RLEC" and collectively, "RLECs") in the
telecommunications industry.

        While none of the companies that participated in the selected precedent transactions is directly comparable to FairPoint and none of the transactions in the selected precedent transactions
analysis is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore selected these transactions because each of the target companies was an RLEC and had operating characteristics, products and services
that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain of FairPoint's operating characteristics, products and services.

        For each of the selected transactions, Evercore reviewed transaction values and calculated the total enterprise value ("TEV") implied for each target company based on the consideration
paid in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company's last twelve months ("LTM") earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (in each case,
calculated for the twelve-month period prior to the latest available data preceding the date of announcement of such transaction).

Table of Contents

        Evercore's analysis indicated average and median TEV to LTM EBITDA multiples of 5.9x and 5.9x, respectively. The selected precedent transactions and the TEV and TEV to LTM
EBITDA multiple related thereto are set forth in the table below:

        Evercore then applied a reference range of LTM EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 7.0x, derived by Evercore based on its review of the selected precedent transactions and its experience and
professional judgment, to the estimated EBITDA of FairPoint for the year ending December 31, 2016, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for FairPoint. A range of implied equity
values was then calculated by reducing the range of implied enterprise values by the amount of net debt (calculated as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of September 30, 2016. This
analysis indicated an implied per-share equity value range for FairPoint of $12.86 to $29.88.

Implied Exchange Ratio

        Evercore used the resulting per-share equity value reference range to calculate the implied exchange ratio by dividing the lowest per-share equity value for FairPoint by Consolidated's
share price of $28.27 per share, as of December 1, 2016, for the low end of the exchange ratio range and dividing the highest per-share equity value for FairPoint by Consolidated's share price
of $28.27 per share, as of December 1, 2016, for the high end of the exchange ratio range. This analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.4548x to 1.0571x of a new
Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore compared this resulting implied exchange ratio to the transaction exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated
share per share of FairPoint common stock in the Merger.

Selected Peer Trading Analysis

        In performing a selected peer trading analysis of FairPoint and Consolidated, Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial, operating and market information relating to FairPoint
and Consolidated to corresponding information of the publicly traded companies listed in the tables below, which Evercore deemed most relevant to consider in relation to FairPoint and
Consolidated,

respectively, based on its professional judgment and experience, because they are public companies with operations that for purposes of this analysis Evercore considered similar to the
operations of FairPoint and Consolidated, respectively.

        Evercore reviewed, among other things, TEV of the selected companies as a multiple of estimated EBITDA, as well as equity value ("EV") of the selected companies as a multiple of free
cash flow ("FCF") for calendar year 2017. EBITDA of FairPoint and Consolidated was calculated on a pre-stock based compensation basis, each in accordance with company practice.
Enterprise values were calculated for the purpose of this analysis as equity value (based on the per share closing price of each selected company on December 1, 2016, multiplied by the fully
diluted number of such company's outstanding equity securities on such date), plus debt, plus minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents (in the case of debt, minority interest, cash and
cash equivalents, as set forth on the most recently publicly available balance sheet of such company, and in the case of minority interest, where applicable). In calculating the enterprise values
of FairPoint and Consolidated, net debt included in such calculations was as of September 30, 2016. Free cash flow was calculated as EBITDA less capital expenditures, interest, cash taxes
and pension and other post-retirement benefit contributions. The financial data of the selected peer companies used by Evercore for this analysis were based on publicly available research
analysts' estimates. The financial data of FairPoint and Consolidated were based on the projections provided by the management of FairPoint and Consolidated, respectively.

        The EBITDA multiples and FCF multiples for the selected peer companies are set forth in the table below:

        Evercore applied a reference range of EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 6.0x and 6.0x to 9.0x to the estimated EBITDA of FairPoint and Consolidated, respectively, for the year ending
December 31, 2017, to derive a range of implied enterprise values. Evercore applied a reference range of FCF multiples of 10.0x to 15.0x to the estimated FCF for each of FairPoint and
Consolidated for the year ending December 31, 2017, to derive a range of implied equity values. All reference ranges were derived by Evercore based on its review of the respective peer
companies selected and its experience and professional judgment. In the case of FairPoint, estimated EBITDA and FCF were based on the projections provided by the management of
FairPoint. In the case of Consolidated, estimated EBITDA and FCF were based on the projections provided by the management of Consolidated and were calculated on a pro forma basis
beginning in 2017, accounting for the sale of Consolidated's equipment business. Using the 2017 EBITDA multiples, this analysis indicated an implied equity value per-share

reference range for FairPoint and Consolidated of approximately $12.61 to $21.18 and $8.79 to $26.67, respectively. Using the 2017 FCF multiples, this analysis indicated an implied equity
value per-share reference range for FairPoint and Consolidated of approximately $11.69 to $17.35 and $21.18 to $31.77, respectively.

Implied Exchange Ratio

        Evercore used the resulting per-share equity value reference ranges to calculate the implied exchange ratios for the EBITDA multiple and FCF multiple cases by dividing the lowest
respective per-share equity value for FairPoint by the highest respective per-share equity value for Consolidated for the low end of the exchange ratio range in each case and dividing the
highest respective per-share equity value for FairPoint by the lowest respective per-share equity value for Consolidated for the high end of the exchange ratio range in each case. This analysis
indicated implied exchange ratio reference ranges of 0.4730x to 2.4091x and 0.3679x to 0.8191x, in the EBITDA multiple and FCF multiple cases, respectively, of a new Consolidated share
for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore compared these implied exchange ratios to the transaction exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated share per share of FairPoint
common stock in the Merger.

        No company utilized in the peer company trading analysis is identical to FairPoint or Consolidated. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing necessarily involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial, operating and market characteristics of FairPoint and Consolidated and other factors that could affect the public trading value
of the companies to which they are being compared. In evaluating the peer companies selected, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of FairPoint and Consolidated, such as the impact of competition on FairPoint or
Consolidated and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial conditions and prospects of FairPoint, Consolidated, the industry or
the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean, median or average, is not in itself a meaningful method of using peer company trading data.

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses

FairPoint

        Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of FairPoint to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flow that FairPoint was projected
to generate from December 31, 2016 through calendar year 2021, based on financial projections for FairPoint that were provided by FairPoint management. Under the terminal EBITDA
multiple methodology, payments relating to pension and post-retirement expenses were included in the calculation of the after-tax free cash flow. Under the perpetuity growth rate case, such
pension and post-retirement payments were excluded from the calculation of after-tax free cash flow, but reflected in a one-time adjustment as described herein.

        Evercore also calculated a terminal value for FairPoint by applying (i) a terminal EBITDA multiple and (ii) a perpetuity growth rate, in each case based on its professional judgment given
the nature of FairPoint and its business and industry, of 5.0x to 6.0x and 0.0% to 1.0%, respectively, to each of (a) the projected standalone EBITDA, and (b) the unlevered, after-tax free cash
flow, in each

case in the terminal year. The terminal values (as calculated using both the terminal EBITDA multiple and the perpetuity growth rate methodologies) for FairPoint were then discounted to
present value as of December 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 6.75% to 7.75%, based on an estimate of FairPoint's weighted average cost of capital, and projected net operating losses (based
on assumptions provided by FairPoint management) were discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 7.25%, to derive respective ranges of implied enterprise
values for FairPoint. Ranges of implied equity values for FairPoint were then calculated (x) in the terminal multiple case, by reducing the respective range of implied enterprise values by the
amount of projected net debt (calculated as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2016, and (y) in the perpetuity growth case, by reducing the respective range of implied
enterprise values by the amount of FairPoint's projected net debt (calculated as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2016 and the amount, on an after-tax basis, of
FairPoint's pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities, in each case as provided by FairPoint's management. Evercore performed this analysis for FairPoint on a standalone basis.
Evercore's analysis indicated an implied per-share equity value reference range for FairPoint on a standalone basis of approximately $12.88 to $20.83 in the terminal multiple case and $9.22 to
$19.83 in the perpetuity growth rate case.

Consolidated

        Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Consolidated to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flow that Consolidated was
projected to generate from December 31, 2016 through calendar year 2020, based on financial projections for Consolidated that were provided by Consolidated management and calculated on
a pro forma basis accounting for the sale of Consolidated's equipment business. Under the terminal EBITDA multiple methodology, payments relating to pension and post-retirement expenses
were included in the calculation of the after-tax free cash flow. Under the perpetuity growth rate case, such pension and post-retirement payments were excluded from the calculation of after-
tax free cash flow, but reflected in a one-time adjustment as described herein.

        Evercore also calculated a terminal value for Consolidated by applying (i) a terminal EBITDA multiple and (ii) a perpetuity growth rate, in each case based on its professional judgment
given the nature of Consolidated and its business and industry, of 8.0x to 9.0x and 1.0% to 2.0%, respectively, to each of (a) the projected standalone EBITDA and (b) the unlevered, after-tax
free cash flow, in each case in the terminal year and calculated on a pro forma basis accounting for the sale of Consolidated's equipment business. The terminal values (as calculated using both
the terminal EBITDA multiple and the perpetuity growth rate methodologies) for Consolidated were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 6.0% to
7.0%, based on an estimate of Consolidated's weighted average cost of capital, to derive respective ranges of implied enterprise values for Consolidated. Ranges of implied equity values for
Consolidated were then calculated (x) in the terminal multiple case, by reducing the respective range of implied enterprise values by the amount of Consolidated's projected net debt (calculated
as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2016, and (y) in the perpetuity growth case, by reducing the respective range of implied enterprise values by the amount of
Consolidated's projected net debt (calculated as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2016 and the amount, on an after-tax basis, of Consolidated's pension and other post-
retirement benefit liabilities, in each case as provided by Consolidated management and calculated on a pro forma basis accounting for the sale of Consolidated's equipment business.
Evercore's analysis indicated an implied per-share equity value reference range for Consolidated on a standalone basis of approximately $17.36 to $23.59 in the terminal multiple case and
$11.16 to $28.82 in the perpetuity growth rate case.

Implied Exchange Ratio

        Based on the implied per-share equity value reference ranges, Evercore also calculated implied exchange ratios for the terminal multiple and perpetuity growth rate cases by dividing the
lowest respective per-share equity value for FairPoint by the midpoint of the respective implied per-share reference range for Consolidated for the low end of the exchange ratio range and
dividing the highest respective per-share equity value for FairPoint by the midpoint of the respective implied per-share reference range for Consolidated for the high end of the exchange ratio
range. This analysis indicated implied exchange ratio reference ranges of 0.6290x to 1.0174x and 0.4504x to 0.9683x, in the terminal multiple case and the perpetuity growth rate case,
respectively, of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore compared each of these exchange ratios to the exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated
share for each share of FairPoint common stock in the Merger.

Net Present Value of Future Stock Price Analysis

FairPoint

        Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the net present value of the future stock price of FairPoint, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical
future value of a company as a function of such company's estimated future EBITDA and its assumed TEV to forward ("Fwd.") EBITDA multiple (based on the succeeding twelve-month
period). Evercore used financial projections for FairPoint provided by the management of FairPoint through calendar year 2019. Evercore first multiplied the EBITDA estimate for calendar
year 2019 by a range of TEV to Fwd. EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 6.0x to calculate the implied future enterprise values as of December 31, 2018. Evercore then calculated the implied future
equity values for FairPoint as of December 31, 2018 by reducing the implied future enterprise values by the amount of FairPoint's projected future net debt (calculated as debt less cash and
cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2018. Evercore then discounted the projected per-share equity value as of a particular future date, December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2016 using a
discount rate of 10.0%. The discount rate was based on Evercore's analysis of the cost of equity for FairPoint. This analysis resulted in an implied per-share equity value reference range of
approximately $12.27 to $19.31.

Consolidated

        Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the net present value of the future stock price of Consolidated, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a
theoretical future value of a company as a function of such company's estimated future EBITDA and its assumed TEV to Fwd. EBITDA multiple. Evercore used financial projections for
Consolidated derived from assumptions provided by Consolidated management through calendar year 2019 and calculated on a pro forma basis to account for the sale of Consolidated's
equipment business. Evercore first multiplied the EBITDA estimate for calendar year 2019 by a range of TEV to Fwd. EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 9.0x to calculate the implied future
enterprise values as of December 31, 2018. Evercore then calculated the implied future equity values for Consolidated as of December 31, 2018 by reducing the implied future enterprise
values by the amount of Consolidated's projected future net debt (calculated as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2018, and adding the cumulative future value of any
dividends projected to be paid by Consolidated as of December 31, 2018. Evercore then discounted the projected per-share equity value as of a particular future date, December 31, 2018, to
December 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 9.5%. The discount rate was based on Evercore's analysis of the cost of equity for Consolidated. This analysis resulted in an implied per-share
equity value reference range of approximately $20.71 to $25.67.

Table of Contents

Implied Exchange Ratio

        Based on the implied per-share equity value reference ranges, Evercore calculated an implied exchange ratio reference range by dividing the lowest respective per-share equity value for
FairPoint by the midpoint of the respective implied per-share reference range for Consolidated for the low end of the exchange ratio range and dividing the highest per-share equity value for
FairPoint by the midpoint of the respective implied per-share reference range for Consolidated for the high end of the exchange ratio range. This analysis indicated, on a standalone basis, an
implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.5290x to 0.8327x of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore compared these exchange ratios to the
exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock in the Merger.

Other Factors

        Evercore also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial analyses in connection with rendering its advice, but were referenced for
informational purposes, including, among other things, the 52-week trading range, the analysts' price targets and precedent premia analyses described below.

52-Week Trading Range

        Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of FairPoint and Consolidated shares during the 52-week period ended December 1, 2016, noting that the low and high intraday prices during
such period ranged from $12.69 to $18.87 for FairPoint and $17.76 to $30.23 for Consolidated. Evercore calculated a daily exchange ratio for the 52-week period ended December 1, 2016 by
dividing the daily closing prices of FairPoint and Consolidated, and then selected an implied exchange ratio reference range using the lowest and highest daily exchange ratio observed during
such period. This analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.5326x to 0.8500x of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore
compared these exchange ratios to the exchange ratios to the exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock in the Merger.

Analyst Price Targets

        Evercore reviewed publicly available share price targets of research analysts' estimates known to Evercore as of December 1, 2016, noting that the low and high share price targets ranged
from $14.00 to $15.00 for FairPoint (with an average price target of $14.50) and that the low and high share price targets ranged from $19.00 to $26.00 for Consolidated (with an average price
target of $22.00). Evercore calculated an implied exchange ratio reference range by dividing the highest share price target for FairPoint by the highest share price target for Consolidated for the
low end of the exchange ratio and dividing the lowest share price target for FairPoint by the lowest share price target for Consolidated for the high end of the exchange ratio. This analysis
indicated an implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.5769x to 0.7368x of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore compared these exchange ratios to
the exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock in the Merger.

Precedent Premia Paid

        Evercore reviewed and analyzed premia paid in all-stock transactions since 2007 involving U.S. target companies with an enterprise value greater than $1 billion. Based on its
professional judgment and premia in the precedent transactions assessed, Evercore applied reference ranges of premia of 15% to 20% to the FairPoint unaffected share price as of December 1,
2016 of $16.75. This analysis indicated a per-share equity value reference range of approximately $19.26 to $20.10 for FairPoint.

Table of Contents

Evercore used the resulting per-share equity value reference range to calculate the implied exchange ratio by dividing the lowest per-share equity value for FairPoint by Consolidated's share
price of $28.27 per share, as of December 1, 2016, for the low end of the exchange ratio range and dividing the highest per-share equity value for FairPoint by Consolidated's share price of
$28.27 per share, as of December 1, 2016, for the high end of the exchange ratio range. This analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio reference range of 0.6814x to 0.7110x of a new
Consolidated share for each share of FairPoint common stock. Evercore compared this resulting implied exchange ratio to the transaction exchange ratio of 0.7300x of a new Consolidated
share per share of FairPoint common stock in the Merger.

Miscellaneous

        The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by Evercore. In connection with the review of
the Merger by the FairPoint Board, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as
a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore's opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not
draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other
analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of FairPoint common stock or Consolidated common stock. No
company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to FairPoint or Consolidated, and no transaction used is directly comparable to the Merger. Further, Evercore's
analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of
the companies or transactions used, including judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of FairPoint, Consolidated and their respective advisors. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling 100%.

        Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the FairPoint Board as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
the shares of FairPoint common stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates
contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly,
estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore's analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially
different from those forecasted in such estimates.

        Pursuant to the terms of Evercore's engagement letter with FairPoint, a fee of $3.5 million was payable to Evercore upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. Evercore
will be entitled to receive an additional fee of $13.7 million following the consummation of the Merger. In addition, FairPoint has agreed to indemnify Evercore for certain liabilities arising out
of its engagement.

Table of Contents

        Prior to Evercore's engagement in connection with the Merger, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial advisory services to FairPoint and received fees for the rendering of such
services, including the reimbursement of expenses. During the two-year period prior to the delivery of its opinion, no material relationship existed between Evercore and its affiliates and
Consolidated pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore or its affiliates as a result of such a relationship. Evercore may provide financial or other services to Consolidated in
the future and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.

        In the ordinary course of business, Evercore or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or financial instruments of FairPoint, Consolidated and their
respective affiliates, for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

        The issuance of the fairness opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.

        The FairPoint Board engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on its qualifications, experience and reputation, as well as familiarity with the business of FairPoint. Evercore is
an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, competitive
biddings, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Certain Prospective Financial Information Reviewed by the FairPoint Board and FairPoint's Financial Advisor 

        In connection with the Merger discussions between Consolidated and FairPoint, FairPoint's and Consolidated's management provided to Consolidated, and Consolidated's and FairPoint's
respective financial advisors, certain non-public, internal financial forecasts regarding the anticipated future operations of FairPoint on a stand-alone basis and estimated synergies arising in
connection with the Merger.

        In connection with the Merger, FairPoint's management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information for FairPoint on a stand-alone basis, without giving effect to the
Merger, and together with Consolidated's management, prepared estimated synergies arising in connection with the Merger. The FairPoint Board also reviewed certain unaudited prospective
financial information for Consolidated on a stand-alone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, which was prepared by Consolidated's management.

        FairPoint has presented below in summary form the unaudited prospective financial information to provide both Consolidated's and FairPoint's stockholders access to this non-public
unaudited prospective financial information, because such financial information was made available to the FairPoint Board.

        The unaudited prospective financial information was also provided to Evercore for purposes of its opinion to the FairPoint Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio to the holders of the FairPoint common stock. See the section entitled "—Opinion of Financial Advisor to FairPoint" beginning on page 60. The summary of these internal
financial forecasts is not being included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to influence your decision whether to approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal.

        Although FairPoint has publicly issued limited projections concerning certain aspects of its expected financial performance, FairPoint, as a matter of course, does not make public its
management's projections as to future results, because of, among other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the
underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect. The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward
complying with the guidelines

established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information or published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking
statements.

        The unaudited prospective financial information of FairPoint has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, FairPoint's management. Ernst & Young LLP and BDO USA, LLP,
FairPoint's previous and current independent registered public accounting firm, respectively, have neither examined, compiled nor performed any procedures with respect to the accompanying
prospective financial information and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP and BDO USA, LLP do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The reports of
Ernst & Young LLP incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus relate to the historical results of Consolidated and FairPoint and do not extend to the prospective
financial information and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the information:

• while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily makes numerous assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of FairPoint, including with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as matters specific to FairPoint's business, and may not prove to have been, or
may no longer be, accurate; 

• does not necessarily reflect revised prospects for FairPoint's business, changes in general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, or any other
transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the projections were prepared; 

• is not necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as set forth below; and 

• should not be regarded as a representation that these estimates will be achieved and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these estimates.

        FairPoint believes the assumptions that its management used as a basis for the estimates were reasonable at the time the estimates were prepared, given the information its management
had at the time. While the prospective financial information set forth below was prepared in good faith, no assurance can be given regarding future events. The prospective financial
information is subjective in many respects and is thus susceptible to interpretation and periodic revision based on actual experience and recent developments. In light of the foregoing, as well
as the uncertainties inherent in any prospective financial information, FairPoint's and Consolidated's stockholders are cautioned not to unduly rely on this information as a predictor of future
operating results or otherwise. None of FairPoint, Consolidated or their respective affiliates or representatives assume any responsibility to stockholders of FairPoint or Consolidated for
accuracy of this information.

        The estimates involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The future financial results of FairPoint may materially differ from those expressed in the estimates due to factors that are
beyond FairPoint's ability to control or predict. These estimates are forward-looking information and as such are subject to the qualifications set forth in the section entitled "Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page 42. FairPoint cannot assure you that the estimates will be realized or that FairPoint's future financial results will not materially vary from the
estimates. Since the estimates cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The estimates do not take into account any circumstances or
events occurring after the date they were prepared.

        FairPoint has not updated, and does not intend to update or otherwise revise, the following internal financial forecasts to reflect circumstances existing since its preparation or
to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. Furthermore, FairPoint has not updated,

FairPoint Forward-Looking Statements

        The following table provides in summary form the five-year financial forecasts with respect to FairPoint provided to the FairPoint Board and Evercore:

Summary of Five-Year Financial Forecasts of FairPoint

Consolidated's Reasons for the Merger 

        Consolidated was formed as an acquisition vehicle in July, 2002, and completed its first transaction on December 31, 2002, when it acquired certain central-Illinois based assets of
McLeodUSA. In April, 2004, Consolidated acquired TXUC from Texas Utilities. In July, 2005, Consolidated completed its initial public offering of common stock. On December 31, 2007,
Consolidated acquired North Pittsburgh Systems, Inc. On July 2, 2012, Consolidated acquired SureWest Communications. On October 16, 2014, Consolidated acquired Enventis Corporation.
Throughout Consolidated's history, Consolidated has focused on acquisitions as a core part of its strategy, and developed a set of evaluation criteria early on which it used and intends to
continue to use to evaluate potential opportunities.

        At nearly every regular quarterly board of directors meeting, Consolidated's management team has reviewed prospective acquisition targets and ranked them according to their
attractiveness and alignment with the acquisition criteria. Where the opportunities were deemed attractive, Consolidated participated from time to time in auctions, made inquiries, and
generally attempted to advance its long-standing strategy to grow through acquisition.

        As a part of that ongoing process, the management team and the Consolidated Board determined that FairPoint met Consolidated's criteria for potential acquisitions, and identified
FairPoint as an attractive potential acquisition candidate. Consolidated entered into a non-disclosure agreement with FairPoint in July 2015 for the purpose of conducting due diligence on
FairPoint and evaluating a

potential transaction. Consolidated and FairPoint entered into a subsequent non-disclosure agreement in August 2016.

        From time to time throughout the period from the time beginning with the initial merger discussions between Consolidated and FairPoint in July 2015, and continuing through the time the
Merger Agreement was executed on December 3, 2016, the Consolidated Board worked with the Consolidated management team to develop various strategies and approaches, including the
approval of what became the terms of the Merger Agreement.

        In approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Consolidated's Board consulted with Consolidated's management, as well as with Consolidated's legal and financial advisors, and
considered, among other things, the following material factors:

• the expectation that the Merger would have an immediate, material, positive impact on Consolidated's cash flow and leverage; 

• the expectation that the Merger would provide Consolidated with an opportunity to overlay its organic growth strategy on a new territory; 

• the expectation that the Merger would more than double Consolidated's fiber footprint; 

• the expectation that the Merger would provide a material increase in scale, including by (i) expanding Consolidated's network reach and scale, (ii) providing an opportunity to
leverage Consolidated's enhanced product suite and consultative sales approach across FairPoint's markets, and (iii) doubling the revenue base and adjusted EBITDA (including
synergies), all of which would be expected to improve Consolidated's platform for acquisition of other targets in the future; 

• the expectation that the Merger would provide Consolidated stockholders with highly compelling financial benefits, including the expectations that the Merger would (i) allow
the combined companies to realize annual, operating synergies, (ii) be accretive to free cash flow per share, (iii) provide Consolidated with the ability to improve its leverage
and dividend payout ratio over time, with expected pro forma total net leverage ratio under Consolidated's credit agreement to be 3.80:1.00 as of the closing of the Merger
(including run-rate synergies), which would represent a reduction from the total net leverage ratio of 4.38:1.00 as of September 30, 2016, and (iv) provide Consolidated with
greater strategic and financial flexibility in the future; 

• the expectation that the Merger would create a platform for future growth through acquisitions to fill in Consolidated's national footprint, and organically through investments in
the combined company's existing markets; 

• the opportunity to integrate FairPoint's business efficiently with Consolidated's existing business; 

• Consolidated management's prior record of successfully integrating acquired companies; and 

• that the Merger would bring together two companies with a common history and shared values of community involvement.

        The Consolidated Board also considered, among other things, the following risks:

• regulatory and litigation risks associated with the Merger or combining the two companies; 

• that there are risks associated with obtaining necessary approvals on terms that satisfy closing conditions to the respective parties' obligations to complete the Merger, and, as a
result of certain conditions to the completion of the Merger, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if approved by both Consolidated's and FairPoint's
stockholders (see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions of the Merger" on page 111);

• the challenges of combining the businesses of the two companies and the attendant risks of not achieving the expected strategic benefits and cost savings, other financial and
operating benefits or improvement in earnings, and of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters for an
extended period of time; 

• the perception of investors and the potential impact on Consolidated's share price; 

• the level of capital expenditures that will be required with respect to the combined business; 

• the ability to secure financing on terms satisfactory to Consolidated; 

• the potential that FairPoint's revenue might continue to decline; 

• the potential increase in cash taxes payable in the future as a result of the transaction; 

• the potential impact of FairPoint's previous acquisitions and bankruptcy; 

• the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which include restrictions on the conduct of Consolidated's business pending the closing of the Merger (see the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Consolidated's Forbearances Before Completion of the Merger" on page 104); and 

• other risks of the type and nature discussed above under the section entitled "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger" on page 35.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Consolidated 

        The Consolidated Board retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed merger and to provide a financial opinion. The
Consolidated Board selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of
Consolidated. On December 3, 2016, at a meeting of the Consolidated Board, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
December 3, 2016 that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Consolidated.

Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any of the parties to the Merger
Agreement, or any class of such persons, relative to the exchange ratio. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of FairPoint or
Consolidated, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,

Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion to the
Consolidated Board, dated as of December 3, 2016. The following summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in
connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative
information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 2, 2016, the most recent trading day prior to Morgan Stanley's presentation
to the Consolidated Board of its financial analysis on December 3, 2016. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors reviewed, without
considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. Furthermore, mathematical analysis (such as
determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.

        In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied upon certain financial projections provided by the managements
of FairPoint and Consolidated and which are described below.

Trading Range Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the trading range of FairPoint common stock and Consolidated common stock for six-month and twelve-month periods ending December 2, 2016. Morgan
Stanley observed that the low and high closing prices for FairPoint common stock for the six-month period ended December 2, 2016 were $13.04 and $17.60, respectively, and the low and
high closing prices for FairPoint common stock for the twelve-month period ended December 2, 2016 were $12.69 and $18.22, respectively. Morgan Stanley observed that the low and high
closing prices for Consolidated common stock for the six-month period ended December 2, 2016 were $21.85 and $30.23, respectively, and the

Table of Contents

low and high closing prices for Consolidated common stock for the twelve-month period ended December 2, 2016 were $17.76 and $30.23, respectively.

        Morgan Stanley calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios using the six-month and twelve-month trading ranges of FairPoint common stock and Consolidated common stock. The low
end of the ranges were calculated by dividing the low value of FairPoint common stock for the period by the high value of Consolidated common stock for the period, and the high end of the
ranges were calculated by dividing the high value of FairPoint common stock for the period by the low value of Consolidated common stock for the period. The six-month trading range
analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio range of 0.43x to 0.81x, and the twelve-month trading range analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio range of 0.42x to 1.03x. Morgan Stanley
noted that the Merger Agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.73x.

Research Analyst Price Targets

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the latest selected public market trading price targets available as of December 2, 2016 for FairPoint common stock by three equity research analysts that
published a price target for FairPoint. These targets reflected each analyst's estimate of the future public market trading price of FairPoint common stock. Morgan Stanley noted that the range
of undiscounted stock price targets for FairPoint common stock from such research targets was $14.00 to $16.00 per share and the range of discounted stock price targets (discounted at 9%
cost of equity twelve months from the date of issuance of the applicable research report) for FairPoint common stock was $12.93 to $14.78. Morgan Stanley noted that the closing price for
FairPoint common stock on December 2, 2016 was $17.00. Morgan Stanley noted that the implied price per share of FairPoint common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the 30-
day volume weighted average price of Consolidated common stock on December 2, 2016 was $19.07, and the implied price per share of FairPoint common stock based on an exchange ratio of
0.73x and the share price of Consolidated common stock as of December 2, 2016 was $20.72.

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the latest selected public market trading price targets available as of December 2, 2016 for Consolidated common stock by five equity research analysts that
published a price target for Consolidated. These targets reflected each analyst's estimate of the future public market trading price of Consolidated common stock. Morgan Stanley noted that the
range of undiscounted stock price targets for Consolidated common stock from such research targets was $19.00 to $30.00 per share and the range of discounted stock price targets (discounted
at 9% cost of equity twelve months from the date of issuance of the research report) for Consolidated common stock was $17.93 to $27.71. Morgan Stanley noted that the closing price for
Consolidated common stock as of December 2, 2016 was $28.38. Morgan Stanley noted that the 30-day volume weighted average price of Consolidated common stock on December 2, 2016
was $26.12.

        Morgan Stanley calculated the exchange ratio range implied by the equity research price targets. In order to calculate the exchange ratio range, Morgan Stanley calculated the implied
exchange ratio only for each of the three equity research analysts that provided price targets for both companies using their price targets for FairPoint common stock and Consolidated common
stock. This analysis yielded an implied range of exchange ratios of 0.47x to 0.68x. Morgan Stanley noted that the Merger Agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.73x.

        The public market trading price targets published by research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for FairPoint common stock and Consolidated common stock
and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of FairPoint and Consolidated and future financial market conditions.

Comparable Public Companies

        In order to assess how the public market values shares of publicly traded telephone communications companies to derive implied ranges for the trading value of FairPoint common stock,
Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain internal financial information and ratios relating to FairPoint with equivalent publicly available data for the following companies:
CenturyLink, Inc.; Cincinnati Bell Inc.; Frontier Communications Corp.; Lumos Networks Corp.; and Windstream Holdings, Inc.

        For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to "adjusted EBITDA" (as defined in FairPoint's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015), excluding stock-based compensation, for calendar year 2017 and the ratio of aggregate value to estimated unlevered free cash flow (for these purposes Morgan
Stanley assumed cash flow to be equal to adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures) for calendar year 2017 for each of the comparable public companies. Morgan Stanley then applied a
range of these ratios, based on its professional judgment choosing ratios from the comparable companies with an asset mix and business quality most similar to that of FairPoint, to FairPoint's
estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2017 of $247.0 million and estimated unlevered free cash flow for calendar year 2017 of $135.0 million, as applicable, based on the FairPoint
management projections to derive an implied reference range for the trading value of FairPoint common stock. The implied trading value range for FairPoint common stock resulting from the
ratio of aggregate value to EBITDA was $12.51 to $19.16. The implied trading value range for FairPoint common stock resulting from the ratio of aggregate value to unlevered free cash flow
was $11.64 to $21.30.

        Morgan Stanley noted that the closing price for FairPoint common stock on December 2, 2016 was $17.00. Morgan Stanley noted that the implied price per share of FairPoint common
stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the 30-day volume weighted average price of Consolidated common stock on December 2, 2016 was $19.07, and the implied price per share of
FairPoint common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the share price of Consolidated common stock as of December 2, 2016 was $20.72.

        No company utilized in the comparable public company analysis is identical to FairPoint. Morgan Stanley selected the companies reviewed in this analysis because it believed them to be
similar to FairPoint based on its experience with companies in the telephone communications sector. Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond FairPoint's control such as the impact of competition on FairPoint and the industry generally,
industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of FairPoint or the industry, or in the financial markets in general.

Precedent Strategic Transactions Analysis

        In order to assess how companies in the telephone communications sector have been valued in precedent merger and acquisition transactions, Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared the

prices and financial multiples paid in the following eight selected precedent transactions announced from October 2008 to February 2015:

        Morgan Stanley calculated multiples from the selected precedent transactions of the target company's aggregate value to its latest twelve months EBITDA both before and after taking into
account estimated synergies anticipated to be realized from the selected precedent transactions. Financial data of the selected precedent transactions were based on publicly available
information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Morgan Stanley calculated implied per share equity reference ranges for FairPoint by applying ranges of multiples derived
from the selected precedent transactions of 4.5x to 6.0x (excluding estimated synergies) and 4.0x to 5.0x (including estimated synergies) to FairPoint's latest twelve months EBITDA. The
implied per share equity reference ranges for FairPoint common stock were $8.99 to $22.60 per share (excluding estimated synergies) and $11.63 to $22.50 per share (including estimated
synergies).

        Morgan Stanley noted that the closing price for FairPoint common stock on December 2, 2016 was $17.00. Morgan Stanley noted that the implied price per share of FairPoint common
stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the 30-day volume weighted average price of Consolidated common stock on December 2, 2016 was $19.07, and the implied price per share of
FairPoint common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the share price of Consolidated common stock as of December 2, 2016 was $20.72.

        No company or transaction utilized in the precedent strategic transaction analyses is identical to Consolidated, FairPoint or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan
Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of Consolidated and FairPoint, such
as the impact of competition on the business of Consolidated, FairPoint or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition of
Consolidated, FairPoint or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which
they are being compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on each of FairPoint and Consolidated based on the projections from the managements of FairPoint and Consolidated,
respectively, which is designed to estimate the value of a company on a standalone basis by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows and terminal value of that company.
Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share equity values for each of FairPoint and Consolidated (valued as of December 31, 2016 with a terminal date of December 31, 2021).

FairPoint Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow of FairPoint, which for these purposes Morgan Stanley assumed cash flow to be equal to adjusted EBITDA less
capital expenditures, cash pension funding, other post-employment benefits cash, unlevered tax expense and other cash flow items (including severance), for the period from January 1, 2017 to
December 31, 2021 based on the FairPoint management projections. Morgan Stanley calculated a terminal value for FairPoint by applying a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 5.00x to
6.00x, based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment, to the estimated EBITDA of FairPoint for calendar year 2021 based on the FairPoint management projections. Morgan Stanley then
discounted the unlevered free cash flow and terminal values to present value as of December 31, 2016 using a range of discount rates from 6.25% to 7.25% selected by Morgan Stanley based
on Morgan Stanley's estimation of FairPoint's weighted average cost of capital utilizing the capital asset pricing model. Morgan Stanley also calculated the estimated value of the cash tax
savings associated with FairPoint's net operating losses ("NOLs") that the combined company could utilize during calendar years 2017 through 2020 based on a projected NOL balance of
approximately $300.0 million as of December 31, 2016, as directed for use by Consolidated management. The estimated cash tax savings were discounted by Consolidated's estimated
weighted average cost of capital of 6.75%. Morgan Stanley then added this cumulative value and deducted the estimated net debt as of December 31, 2016 from the resulting value, and
divided that resulting value by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding, to derive equity value. Morgan Stanley noted that the closing price for FairPoint common stock on December 2,
2016 was $17.00. Morgan Stanley noted that the implied price per share of FairPoint common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the 30-day volume weighted average price of
Consolidated common stock on December 2, 2016 was $19.07, and the implied price per share of FairPoint common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.73x and the share price of
Consolidated common stock as of December 2, 2016 was $20.72.

        Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow of Consolidated, which for these purposes Morgan Stanley assumed cash flow to be equal to adjusted EBITDA less
cash taxes, capital expenditures, changes in net working capital, cash pension funding and other cash flow items, for the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 based on the
Consolidated management projections. Morgan Stanley calculated a terminal value for Consolidated by applying a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 8.00x to 9.00x, based on Morgan
Stanley's professional judgment, to the estimated EBITDA of Consolidated for calendar year 2021 based on the Consolidated management projections. Morgan Stanley then discounted the
unlevered free cash flow and terminal value to present value as of December 31, 2016 using a range of discount rates of 6.25% to 7.25% selected by Morgan Stanley based on Morgan
Stanley's estimation of Consolidated's weighted average cost of capital utilizing the capital asset pricing model. Morgan Stanley then deducted the estimated net debt and non-controlling
interests as of December 31, 2016 from the resulting value, and divided that resulting value by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding, to derive equity value. This analysis indicated an
implied per share reference range for a share of Consolidated common stock of $16.71 to $22.90 per share, on a fully diluted basis.

Exchange Ratio Implied by Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley calculated the exchange ratio ranges implied by the discounted cash flow analyses. Morgan Stanley compared the lowest implied per share value for FairPoint common
stock to the highest implied per share value for Consolidated common stock to derive the lowest exchange ratio implied by the analyses. Similarly, Morgan Stanley compared the highest
implied per share value for FairPoint common stock to the lowest implied per share value for Consolidated common stock to derive the highest exchange ratio implied by the analyses. Morgan
Stanley noted that the Merger Agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.73x.

Other Analysis

        The analysis and data described below were presented to the Consolidated Board for informational/reference purposes only and did not provide the basis for, and were not otherwise
material to, the rendering of Morgan Stanley's opinion.

Pro Forma Financial Has-Gets Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the Consolidated and FairPoint management projections in order to calculate the potential pro forma financial effects of the Merger (including estimated
synergies) on the combined company's calendar years 2018 and 2021 estimated financial metrics (based on Consolidated having pro forma ownership of 71.3% of the combined company,
calculated using the 0.73x exchange ratio from the Merger Agreement and the number of fully diluted shares of FairPoint and Consolidated common stock outstanding as of December 2,
2016) relative to the same estimated financial metrics for Consolidated as a standalone company. Morgan Stanley's comparison indicated that the following estimated financial metrics of
Consolidated could increase or (decrease) as a part of the combined company relative to a standalone company as follows:

General

        In connection with the review of the Merger by the Consolidated Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion.
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered
the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of these
analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of FairPoint or Consolidated.

        In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters. Many of these assumptions are beyond the control of FairPoint and Consolidated. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the businesses of FairPoint
and Consolidated and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of FairPoint and Consolidated and the
industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.

        Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view to Consolidated of the exchange ratio pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to the Consolidated Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of
Consolidated common stock might actually trade following consummation of the Merger or at any time.

        The exchange ratio was determined through arm's-length negotiations between FairPoint and Consolidated and was approved by the Consolidated Board. Morgan Stanley provided advice
to Consolidated during these negotiations. Morgan Stanley did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Consolidated, nor that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only
appropriate exchange ratio for the Merger. Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available, nor did it address the underlying business decision of Consolidated to enter into the Merger Agreement. In
addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion was not intended to, and does not, in any manner, address the prices at which Consolidated common stock might trade following consummation of the
Merger or at any time, and Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how Consolidated stockholders should vote at the Consolidated special meeting.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion and its oral presentation to the Consolidated Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Consolidated Board in deciding to approve the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Consolidated Board
with respect to the exchange ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Consolidated Board would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley's customary practice. Morgan
Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth

management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage,
as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage
funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for its own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or
equity securities or loans of Consolidated, FairPoint or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.

        Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Consolidated Board with financial advisory services and a financial opinion described in this section and attached
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex III in connection with the Merger and Consolidated has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a transaction fee of $13 million, which is payable upon
and is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Consolidated has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses incurred from time to time in connection with
providing its professional services, including reasonable fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors incurred in performing its services. In addition, Consolidated has agreed to
indemnify Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, its officers, directors, employees and agents and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and
expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, relating to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement. Morgan Stanley or one or more of its affiliates is providing to
Consolidated a portion of the financing required in connection with the Merger, for which Morgan Stanley will receive additional fees from Consolidated. In the two years prior to the date of
Morgan Stanley's opinion, in addition to the services provided in connection with the Merger and the opinion, Morgan Stanley has provided financial advisory and financing services to
Consolidated and its affiliates and received aggregate fees of between $3.0 million and $4.0 million in connection with such services. During the same period, Morgan Stanley has provided
financing services to FairPoint and its affiliates, including as a lender and administrative agent with respect to FairPoint's senior secured credit facilities, and received aggregate fees of less
than $1.0 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Consolidated and FairPoint and their affiliates in the future
and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of those services.

The Consolidated Board after Completion of the Merger 

        Consolidated's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the classification of the Consolidated Board into three classes of directors, designated Class I, Class II and
Class III, as nearly equal in size as is practicable, serving staggered three-year terms. One class of directors is elected each year to hold office for a three-year term or until successors of such
directors are duly elected and qualified. The current size of the Consolidated Board is eight directors, comprised of two Class I directors, three Class II directors and three Class III directors.

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, FairPoint is entitled to select, subject to approval by Consolidated (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and
Consolidated has agreed to take all such action as may be reasonably necessary to cause, one individual from among the current members of the FairPoint Board to be elected to the
Consolidated Board as of the effective time of the Merger. For further information on FairPoint's directors, see FairPoint's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, after
completion of the Merger, Consolidated expects that the Consolidated Board would consist of Richard A. Lumpkin (Class I Director—term expiring in 2018), Timothy D. Taron (Class I
Director—term expiring in 2018), an individual selected from the FairPoint Board (Class I Director—term expiring in 2018), Thomas A. Gerke (Class II Director—term expiring in 2019),
Roger H. Moore (Class II Director—term expiring in 2019), Dale E. Parker (Class II Director—term expiring in 2019), Robert J. Currey (Class III

Interests of FairPoint Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the FairPoint Board with respect to the Merger, FairPoint's stockholders should be aware that certain executive officers and directors of FairPoint
have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of FairPoint's stockholders generally. The FairPoint Board was aware of the interests described below and
considered them, among other matters, when approving the FairPoint Merger Proposal and recommending that FairPoint's stockholders vote to approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal.

Change in Control Benefits for Executive Officers

        FairPoint has employment agreements with Messrs. Sunu, Nixon, Lunny, Metge and Rush and Ms. Turner and a severance in connection with a change in control agreement with
Mr. Hogshire that provide change in control benefits as summarized below.

Paul H. Sunu

        On April 9, 2013, FairPoint entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Sunu, as amended on August 14, 2015. Pursuant to Mr. Sunu's employment agreement,
in the event that Mr. Sunu's employment is terminated by FairPoint without cause (other than due to his death or disability) within twelve months before or twelve months after a change in
control, or in the event that Mr. Sunu provides FairPoint with notice of his termination of employment without good reason during the 13th month following the consummation of a change in
control, Mr. Sunu is entitled to a lump sum payment of (A) all accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of the termination, any amounts payable under the Amended and Restated 2010
Long Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"), any unpaid or unreimbursed expenses and any benefits to be provided under FairPoint's employee benefits plans upon a termination of employment
("Accrued Obligations"), (B) any unpaid annual incentive plan (the "AIP") bonus (in respect of any completed fiscal year that has ended prior to the date of the termination of Mr. Sunu's
employment), (C) two times the amount of Mr. Sunu's then-current base salary, (D) the cost of continued health and disability insurance coverage for Mr. Sunu and his covered dependents for
a period of 24 months and (E) the greater of two times the amount of his average AIP bonus for the immediately preceding two fiscal years where such average is determined by reference to
the actual annual bonus paid to Mr. Sunu for the immediately two preceding fiscal years, or two times his target AIP bonus for the year in which the termination occurred. Mr. Sunu will also be
entitled to a pro rata portion of the AIP bonus for the year in which the termination occurred and will receive immediate accelerated vesting of all outstanding unvested equity awards.

        If Mr. Sunu terminates his employment for good reason, he will be entitled to the benefits described above, except that the bonus payment described in (E) of the preceding paragraph will
be based on two times the average AIP bonus paid to him for the two preceding fiscal years, and accelerated vesting of then outstanding equity awards is limited to the next tranche of time-
based awards and the target amount of performance-based awards.

        The employment agreement and the award agreements under the LTIP provide that upon the occurrence of a change in control, Mr. Sunu's unvested benefits under the LTIP will be
accelerated and vest in full.

        The payment of any amount or provision of any benefit upon the termination under the employment agreement as described above is conditioned upon Mr. Sunu's execution and delivery
to FairPoint of a release of all claims against, among other parties, FairPoint and its subsidiaries. In

addition, Mr. Sunu's entitlement to payments and benefits upon termination under his employment agreement is subject to his compliance with a non-interference agreement with FairPoint,
pursuant to which Mr. Sunu agrees to, among other things, certain non-competition and non-solicitation provisions for 24 months following the termination of his employment with FairPoint.

Karen D. Turner, Peter G. Nixon, John J. Lunny, Bruce F. Metge and Steven G. Rush

        FairPoint entered into employment agreements with Ms. Turner (on November 20, 2014, as amended on August 14, 2015 and November 21, 2016); Mr. Nixon (on January 22, 2013, as
amended on August 14, 2015 and May 16, 2016); Mr. Lunny (on July 1, 2014, as amended on August 14, 2015 and November 21, 2016); Mr. Metge (on September 6, 2016) and Mr. Rush (on
August 10, 2015, as amended on June 1, 2016).

        Pursuant to the respective employment agreements, in the event the executive's employment is terminated by FairPoint without cause (other than due to death or disability) or by the
executive for good reason within six months before or six months after a change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump sum payment of (A) the Accrued Obligations, (B) any unpaid AIP
bonus (in respect of any completed fiscal year that has ended prior to the date of the termination of the executive's employment), (C) two times the amount of the executive's then-current base
salary, (D) the cost of continued health and disability insurance coverage for the executive and his or her covered dependents for a period of 24 months and (E) the greater of two times the
amount of his or her average AIP bonus for the immediately preceding two fiscal years where such average is determined by reference to the actual annual bonus paid to the executive for the
immediately two preceding fiscal years, or two times his or her target AIP bonus for the year in which the termination occurred.

        If the executive's employment is terminated by FairPoint without cause (other than due to death or disability) or by the executive for good reason outside the six month window described
above, the executive will be entitled to the benefits described above, except that the bonus payment described in (E) of the preceding paragraph will be based on two times the average AIP
bonus paid to the executive for the two preceding fiscal years.

        The employment agreements and the award agreements under the LTIP provide that upon the occurrence of a change in control, all of the executives' unvested benefits under the LTIP will
be accelerated and vest in full.

        The payment of any amount or provision of any benefit upon termination under an employment agreement (as described above) is conditioned upon the executive's execution and delivery
to FairPoint of a release of all claims against, among other parties, FairPoint and its subsidiaries. In addition, the executive's entitlement to payments and benefits under his or her employment
agreement is subject to his or her compliance with a non-interference agreement with FairPoint, pursuant to which the executive agrees to, among other things, certain non-competition and
non-solicitation provisions for twelve months following his or her employment with FairPoint.

John Hogshire

        On November 5, 2015, FairPoint entered into a severance in connection with a change in control agreement, as amended on January 11, 2017 (the "Severance Agreement"), with
Mr. Hogshire, FairPoint's Principal Accounting Officer. Pursuant to the Severance Agreement, if, within twelve months of a change in control, (i) FairPoint terminates Mr. Hogshire's
employment without cause (other than due to his death or disability), (ii) Mr. Hogshire terminates his employment as a result of a reduction in his cash compensation (i.e., base salary and
annual bonus opportunity) by greater than 5% without his consent or (iii) Mr. Hogshire terminates his employment as a result of a required relocation of his principal place of employment by
more than 100 miles without his consent, and such termination results in Mr. Hogshire incurring a "separation from service" as defined under Treasury

Regulation 1.409A-1(h) and Mr. Hogshire has executed an general release of claims in favor of FairPoint, Mr. Hogshire is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to (A) the amount of his then-
current base salary for six months and (B) subsidization of his applicable COBRA premiums so that the COBRA premiums paid by Mr. Hogshire equal the same amount that he paid as an
active employee under FairPoint's health insurance plan for the lesser of six months following the termination of his employment or until Mr. Hogshire becomes eligible for insurance benefits
from another employer.

        Mr. Hogshire's entitlement to payments and benefits under the Severance Agreement is subject to his compliance with a non-interference provision, pursuant to which Mr. Hogshire agrees
to, among other things, certain non-solicitation provisions for the period of six months immediately following the termination date.

        The award agreements under the LTIP provide that upon the occurrence of a change in control, all of Mr. Hogshire's unvested benefits under the LTIP will be accelerated and vest in full.

Impact of Internal Revenue Code

        If it is determined that any change in control payment due would result in an excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, each executive can elect to either receive full
payment and pay the excise tax (in which case FairPoint's tax deduction for compensation paid would be severely limited) or have the payment reduced to the amount necessary to avoid the
excise tax. The foregoing reduction is referred to herein as the "280G cutback provision."

Golden Parachute Compensation for Named Executive Officers

        For purposes of the disclosure in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, FairPoint's "named executive officers" are:

• Paul H. Sunu (Chief Executive Officer and Director) 

• Karen D. Turner (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) 

• Peter G. Nixon (Executive Vice President, Revenue and External Affairs) 

• John J. Lunny (Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer) 

• Steven G. Rush (Executive Vice President, Northern New England Operations) 

• Ajay Sabherwal (former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) 

• Shirley J. Linn (former Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary) 

• Anthony A. Tomae (former Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer)

        In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the following table sets forth the estimated value of the benefits under the employment agreements and LTIP described above that,
assuming the occurrence of a change in control and termination of employment at May 31, 2017, would be received by each FairPoint named executive officer either immediately at the
effective time of the Merger (i.e., on a "single-trigger" basis) or on a qualifying termination of employment following, or prior to and in connection with, the Merger (i.e., on a "double-trigger"
basis). The actual amount of any payments (if any) will likely differ from the below estimated amounts. No named executive officer is

(a) Upon a change in control, there is accelerated vesting of all unvested in-the-money stock option awards, and as described below, the options will be cancelled
and the option holders will receive a number of shares of Consolidated common stock based on the spread. These awards are time-based. The value was
determined by multiplying the total number of shares subject to the unvested option by the difference between the average closing market price for FairPoint
common stock over the first five business days following the public announcement of the Merger and the exercise price of each stock option award. The
accelerated vesting is "single-trigger" in nature. 

(b) Upon a change in control, there is accelerated vesting of all outstanding restricted stock awards. These awards are time-based. The value was determined by
multiplying the number of shares whose vesting is accelerated by the average closing market price for FairPoint common stock over the first five business days
following the public announcement of the Merger. The accelerated vesting is "single-trigger" in nature. 

(c) Upon a change in control, there is accelerated vesting of all outstanding performance share awards. In the absence of the Merger, these awards would only have
been earned based on the achievement of certain performance goals with cliff vesting at the end of the performance period. The value was determined by
multiplying the number of shares by the average closing market price for FairPoint common stock over the first five business days following the public
announcement of the Merger. The accelerated vesting is "single-trigger" in nature.

(4) 280G cutback provision: Based on the estimated calculations in accordance with IRS rules, it appears that a reduction in the change in control payments for each of
Mr. Lunny and Mr. Rush to $1 less than the amount that would trigger the 280G excise tax would result in a net after tax payment that is larger than the net after tax
payment if the executive received the full unreduced benefits and paid the excise tax. Mr. Lunny's payment would need to be reduced by approximately $18,800 and
Mr. Rush's payment would need to be reduced by approximately $95,700. The above table does not reflect these reductions. The other executives' receipt of full
unreduced benefits and payment of the excise tax would result in a larger after-tax payment, so the 280G cutback provision

Change in Control Benefits for the FairPoint Board

        With the exception of Mr. Gingold, who elected to forgo all compensation, there is accelerated vesting in 2017 upon a change in control of all outstanding restricted stock awards to
members of the FairPoint Board valued at $143,400 for each director. These awards were time-based. The value was determined by multiplying the number of shares by the average closing
market price for FairPoint common stock over the first five business days following the public announcement of the Merger.

Treatment of FairPoint Equity Awards

        Each FairPoint Option, to the extent outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, shall become fully vested as of the effective time of the Merger
and shall, without any action on the part of the holder of such option, be automatically cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective
time of the Merger, that number of shares of Consolidated common stock as is equal to (i) the product of (A) the adjusted option shares (as defined below), multiplied by (B) the difference of
(1) the per share closing price for Consolidated common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date, minus (2) the
adjusted exercise price (as defined below), divided by (ii) the per share closing price for Consolidated common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day
immediately preceding the closing date (the "option consideration"); provided, however, that in the event that the adjusted exercise price of any FairPoint Option is equal to or greater than the
per share closing price for Consolidated common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date, such FairPoint Option
shall be canceled and no option consideration shall be payable in respect of such FairPoint Option. The term "adjusted exercise price" means, with respect to each FairPoint Option, the
quotient of (A) the exercise price set forth in such FairPoint Option, in each case as adjusted to the date of such calculation in accordance with the terms of such FairPoint Option, divided by
(B) 0.7300. The term "adjusted option shares" means, with respect to each FairPoint Option, the product of (A) the number of shares of FairPoint common stock underlying such FairPoint
Option, in each case as adjusted to the date of such calculation in accordance with the terms of such FairPoint Option, multiplied by (B) 0.7300.

        Each FairPoint Performance Award, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, shall become 100% fully vested as of the effective time of the Merger
and shall, without any action on the part of any holder of such FairPoint Performance Award, be automatically canceled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the effective time of the Merger, that number of shares of Consolidated common stock as is equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of FairPoint common stock underlying
such FairPoint Performance Award, multiplied by (ii) 0.7300.

does not apply. These payments do not reflect any value assigned to the non-compete provisions of each employee's employment agreement. The extent to which
any portion of the cash severance is deemed consideration for the non-compete would decrease the amount that is subject to 280G, and potentially affect the 280G
cutback provision.

(5) Mr. Tomae's employment with FairPoint terminated without cause effective January 29, 2016. No cash amounts are payable to Mr. Tomae because he terminated
employment with FairPoint prior to the Merger. However, in accordance with the performance share awards granted under the LTIP, Mr. Tomae's outstanding
performance awards on his termination date were prorated to reflect the number of performance shares earned during the performance period while the remaining
performance shares were forfeited on his termination date. The performance shares earned by Mr. Tomae will vest immediately upon the effective time of the
Merger.

        Restricted share awards granted under any FairPoint stock plan, to the extent outstanding and subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions (whether time-based or performance-based), shall
become fully vested or released from such forfeiture conditions as of the effective time of the Merger and shall be treated as shares of FairPoint common stock for all purposes of the Merger
Agreement.

Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

        The Merger Agreement provides that, from and after the effective time of the Merger, each of Consolidated and FairPoint, as the surviving company, shall jointly and severally indemnify
and hold harmless each person who served as a director or officer of FairPoint or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the Merger and, to the fullest extent required by law, promptly pay
or reimburse expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any claim in advance of the final disposition of such claim, subject to certain
conditions. The Merger Agreement further provides that, prior to the effective time of the Merger, FairPoint shall or, if FairPoint is unable to, Consolidated shall cause FairPoint, as the
surviving company in the Merger as of the effective time, to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of FairPoint's
existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and FairPoint's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from
and after the effective time of the Merger with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, provided that the annual premium therefor shall
not exceed $1,718,760. If such "tail policy" cannot be obtained, Consolidated or FairPoint as the surviving company, as the case may be, is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as much directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for $1,718,760 per year on terms substantially similar to FairPoint's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance.

Effect of the Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into FairPoint.
FairPoint will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated.

Merger Consideration 

        At the effective time of the Merger, each share of FairPoint common stock (other than shares owned directly by FairPoint, any FairPoint subsidiary, Consolidated or Merger Sub) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into and become the right to receive 0.7300 shares of Consolidated common stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld.

        The rights pertaining to Consolidated common stock will be different from the rights pertaining to FairPoint common stock, because the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Consolidated in effect immediately after the Merger is completed will be different from the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of FairPoint. For a description of the rights pertaining to
Consolidated common stock and Consolidated's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, see the sections entitled "Description of Consolidated Capital Stock" and "Comparison of Rights of
Common Stockholders of FairPoint and Common Stockholders of Consolidated" on pages 130 and 131, respectively.

Ownership of Consolidated Following the Merger 

        Based on the closing sale price for Consolidated's shares on February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, stockholders of
Consolidated would hold approximately 70.1% in the aggregate, and stockholders of FairPoint would hold

Table of Contents

approximately 29.9% in the aggregate, of the issued and outstanding shares of Consolidated common stock if the Merger were to occur on such date, in each case as determined on a fully-
diluted basis.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange Procedures; Fractional Shares 

        The conversion of FairPoint common stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will occur automatically at the effective time of the Merger. Prior to the effective time of the
Merger (and, with respect to Consolidated common stock, from time to time after the effective time of the Merger, as applicable), Consolidated will deposit with the exchange agent an amount
in cash and certificates representing shares of Consolidated common stock sufficient to effect the conversion of each share of FairPoint common stock into the Merger Consideration pursuant
to the Merger Agreement.

        Approximately five business days after the effective time of the Merger, the exchange agent will mail to each holder of record of FairPoint common stock as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger a letter of transmittal containing instructions for obtaining the aggregate Merger Consideration that the stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger.
The letter of transmittal will contain instructions for surrendering certificates representing shares of FairPoint common stock to the exchange agent. The exchange agent will mail the aggregate
Merger Consideration (including, if applicable, cash in lieu of any fractional share of Consolidated common stock) to the stockholder approximately ten business days after the exchange agent
has received all of the stockholder's certificates representing shares of FairPoint common stock, a properly signed and completed letter of transmittal in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions.

        After the effective time of the Merger, each certificate that previously represented shares of FairPoint common stock will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
described above and dividends and distributions on, and cash in lieu of any fractional share of, Consolidated common stock as described below.

        Until holders of certificates previously representing shares of FairPoint common stock have surrendered those certificates to the exchange agent, those holders will not receive dividends
or distributions on any shares of Consolidated common stock into which such shares have been converted. When delivery of the Merger Consideration is made to such holders as described
above, the exchange agent will also pay to such holders, without interest, all dividends and other distributions in respect of such Consolidated common stock with a record date after the
effective time of the Merger and a payment date on or prior to the date of surrender of certificates and not previously paid and on the appropriate payment date any such dividends or
distributions with a record date after the effective time of the Merger and a payment date subsequent to such surrender.

        No fractional shares of Consolidated common stock will be issued to any FairPoint stockholder in the Merger. Each FairPoint stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Consolidated common stock in the Merger will receive cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share of Consolidated
common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of FairPoint common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger) by (ii) the last reported sale price of Consolidated common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by Consolidated and FairPoint) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the effective time of the Merger, less any applicable taxes
required to be withheld.

Table of Contents

        Consolidated and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, and pay to the appropriate taxing authorities, any applicable taxes. Any such
amount which is properly withheld and paid to a taxing authority by Consolidated or the exchange agent will be treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the
person from whom it is withheld.

        If any certificate representing shares of FairPoint common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit attesting to that fact by the person claiming that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Consolidated or the surviving corporation of the Merger, the delivery by such person of a bond (in such amount as Consolidated
or the surviving corporation may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the exchange agent, Consolidated or the surviving corporation with respect to or on account
of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate, the exchange agent will issue, in exchange for all rights to the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the total amount of Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of FairPoint common stock represented by such certificate.

Accounting Treatment 

        The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Consolidated will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of FairPoint's tangible and intangible assets
and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price being recorded as goodwill. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is not amortized but is tested
for impairment at least annually.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

United States Antitrust

        United States antitrust laws prohibit Consolidated and FairPoint from completing the Merger until they have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the HSR Act and a required waiting period has ended. FairPoint and Consolidated filed the required notification and report
forms with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on December 14, 2016. The required waiting period was terminated on January 11, 2017.

        At any time before or after the effective time of the Merger, the Federal Trade Commission or others (including states and private parties) could take action under the antitrust laws,
including seeking to prevent the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally approve the Merger upon the divesture of assets of Consolidated or FairPoint. There can be no assurances
that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such challenge is made, that it will not be successful.

Other Laws

        In addition to the regulatory approvals described above, completion of the Merger is also conditioned upon the receipt of the following approvals of the FCC, the Colorado PUC, the
Georgia PSC, the Illinois CC, the Kansas CC, the Maine PUC, the New Hampshire PUC, the New York PSC, the Ohio PUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, the Vermont PSB, the Virginia SCC and
filing notices with the Alabama PSC, the Florida PSC, the Massachusetts DPU, the Missouri PSC, the Oklahoma CC and the Washington UTC.

        On December 20, 2016, FairPoint and its subsidiaries that are regulated by the FCC, and Consolidated and Merger Sub jointly filed domestic and international 214 applications with the
FCC for approval of the transfer of control of those FairPoint subsidiaries to Consolidated.

No Appraisal Rights for FairPoint's Stockholders 

        Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that stockholders have the right, in some circumstances, to dissent from certain corporate actions and to instead demand
payment of the fair value of their shares. Stockholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to shares of any class or series of stock if such shares of stock, or depositary receipts in respect
thereof, are either (a) listed on a national securities exchange or (b) held of record by more than 2,000 holders, unless the stockholders receive in exchange for their shares anything other than
(w) shares of stock of the surviving or resulting combined corporation (or depositary receipts in respect thereof), (x) shares of stock of any other corporation (or depositary receipts in respect
thereof) that, as of the effective date of the merger, is either listed on a national securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 holders of record, (y) cash in lieu of fractional shares or
fractional depositary receipts described in clauses (w) and (x) or (z) any combination of the foregoing. Therefore, because (i) FairPoint common stock is listed on NASDAQ Capital Market,
and (ii) FairPoint stockholders will receive in the Merger only shares of Consolidated common stock, which is publicly listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, holders of FairPoint common stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the Merger with respect to their shares of FairPoint common stock.

Stock Exchange Listing of Consolidated Common Stock 

        Shares of Consolidated common stock issuable to FairPoint's stockholders in the Merger must have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market.

Delisting and Deregistration of FairPoint Common Stock 

        If the Merger is completed, FairPoint common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and FairPoint will no longer file
periodic reports with the SEC on account of FairPoint common stock.

Legal Proceedings Related to the Merger 

        On February 7, 2017, an alleged class action complaint was filed by a purported stockholder of FairPoint in the United Stated District Court for the Western District of North Carolina
(Case No. 3:17-cv-51) against FairPoint, the members of the FairPoint Board, Consolidated and Merger Sub. Among other things, the complaint alleges that the disclosures in the Form S-4
Registration Statement (of which this joint proxy/prospectus is a part) filed by Consolidated with the SEC on January 26, 2017, in connection with the Merger, are materially incomplete and
misleading in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms or, alternatively,
to rescind the Merger in the event the defendants consummate the Merger, in addition to damages and attorney fees and costs. As of February 24, 2017, FairPoint and the other defendants have
not yet filed an answer or other responsive pleading to the complaint. See the section entitled "A lawsuit has been filed against FairPoint, the members of the FairPoint Board, Consolidated and
Merger Sub challenging the Merger and any adverse judgment in such lawsuit, or any other lawsuits that may be filed challenging the Merger, may prevent the Merger from becoming effective
or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe." under "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger."

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 

        The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of the merger of Merger Sub with and into FairPoint, with
FairPoint surviving, and, unless otherwise noted in the following discussion, expresses the opinion of Schiff Hardin LLP, tax counsel for Consolidated, insofar as it relates to matters of U.S.
federal income tax law and legal conclusions with respect to those matters. This summary is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (including proposed and
temporary regulations), rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the IRS and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to
differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Such change could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences described below. No assurance can be given that
the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below.

        This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a particular person in light of its investment or tax circumstances or to persons subject
to special tax rules, such as partnerships, subchapter S corporations or other pass-through entities, banks, financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, trusts and estates, dealers in stocks, securities or currencies, traders in securities that have elected to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for
their securities, persons holding FairPoint common stock as part of an integrated transaction, including a "straddle," "hedge," "constructive sale" or "conversion transaction," persons whose
functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code and persons who acquired the FairPoint common stock
pursuant to the exercise of employee incentive stock options or otherwise as compensation. This summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local government, or
of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a particular person.

        This discussion is directed solely to U.S. Holders (as defined below) who hold FairPoint common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally
means property held for investment.

        As used in this section, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of FairPoint common stock who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state of
the United States or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; 

• a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control
all substantial decisions of the trust; or 

• a trust in existence on August 20, 1996 that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person (as defined in the Code).

        If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds FairPoint common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership, and a partner of a partnership, holding FairPoint common stock should consult its own tax advisor
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to it of the Merger.

Table of Contents

        This summary is not a comprehensive description of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to you. Neither Consolidated nor FairPoint has
requested a ruling from the IRS in connection with the Merger or related transactions. Accordingly, the discussion below neither binds the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a
contrary position. Consolidated and FairPoint urge you to consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances and the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
you of the Merger, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or
other tax laws.

Treatment of the Merger as a Reorganization—General 

        Consolidated and FairPoint have adopted the Merger Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" and based on the opinions to be delivered at the closing of the Merger by Schiff Hardin LLP,
tax counsel for Consolidated, and Paul Hastings LLP, tax counsel to FairPoint, that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, will treat the
Merger as a "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes. However, no ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS with respect to the Merger, and therefore no assurance can be given
that the IRS will not challenge the tax treatment of the Merger as a reorganization. If the Merger fails to qualify as a reorganization, U.S. Holders would be treated as if they sold their FairPoint
common stock in a taxable transaction. In such event, each U.S. Holder would recognize gain or loss with respect to the disposition of its shares of FairPoint common stock equal to the
difference between (i) the U.S. Holder's basis in such shares and (ii) the fair market value (as of the effective time of the Merger) of the Consolidated common stock received in the Merger
plus any cash in lieu of fractional shares, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld. Such gain or loss would be determined separately for each identifiable block of FairPoint common
stock exchanged in the Merger, and such gain or loss would be treated as capital gain or capital loss.

        The tax opinions to be delivered at the closing of the Merger by Schiff Hardin LLP, tax counsel to Consolidated, and Paul Hastings LLP, tax counsel to FairPoint, regarding the Merger
will not address any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the Merger. The tax opinions are subject to customary qualifications and assumptions, including that the Merger will be
completed according to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In rendering the tax opinions, Schiff Hardin LLP and Paul Hastings LLP will rely on representations of FairPoint, Merger Sub and
Consolidated. If any such assumption or representation is or becomes inaccurate, FairPoint and Consolidated may be unable to rely upon the opinions of counsel regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger, and the expected tax treatment to U.S. holders could be adversely affected. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment but is not
binding on the IRS or on any court. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences set
forth in this summary.

Consequences of the Merger to FairPoint and Consolidated 

        None of FairPoint, Consolidated and Merger Sub will recognize gain or loss as a result of the Merger.

Tax Consequences of the Merger for U.S. Holders of FairPoint Common Stock 

        A U.S. Holder will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the receipt of shares of Consolidated common stock in the Merger except for any gain or loss recognized with respect to cash
received in lieu of a fractional share of Consolidated common stock.

        A U.S. Holder's aggregate tax basis in the Consolidated common stock received in the Merger in exchange for its FairPoint common stock, including any fractional shares deemed
received by the U.S.

Table of Contents

Holder under the treatment discussed below in "—Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares of Consolidated Common Stock," generally will equal such U.S. Holder's aggregate tax basis in the
FairPoint common stock surrendered by such U.S. Holder in the Merger. The holding period for the shares of Consolidated common stock received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger in
exchange for its FairPoint common stock, including any fractional shares deemed received by the U.S. Holder under the treatment discussed below in "—Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares of
Consolidated Common Stock," generally will include the holding period for the shares of FairPoint common stock exchanged therefor.

Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares of Consolidated Common Stock 

        A U.S. Holder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of Consolidated common stock will be treated as having received the fractional share of Consolidated common stock
pursuant to the Merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share of Consolidated common stock for cash in a redemption by Consolidated. In general, this deemed redemption will be
treated as a sale or exchange, and a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder and (ii) the portion of the basis
of the shares of FairPoint common stock allocable to such fractional interest. Such gain or loss generally will constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder's holding period for the FairPoint common stock exchanged by such U.S. Holder is greater than one year as of the effective time of the Merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

        A U.S. Holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding in respect of cash payments in lieu of a fractional share of Consolidated
common stock, unless the U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption, furnishes its taxpayer identification number (in the case of individuals, their social security number) and
otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. Holder under the backup withholding rules are not
additional tax and will be allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Reporting Requirements 

        A U.S. Holder who receives shares of Consolidated common stock as a result of the Merger will be required to retain records pertaining to the Merger. Each U.S. holder who is required to
file a U.S. tax return and who is a "significant holder" that receives Consolidated common stock in the Merger will be required to file a statement with the significant holder's U.S. federal
income tax return setting forth such significant holder's basis (determined immediately before the exchange) in the FairPoint common stock surrendered and the fair market value (determined
immediately before the exchange) of the FairPoint common stock that is exchanged by such significant holder. Generally, a "significant holder" is a U.S. Holder who receives shares of
Consolidated common stock in the Merger and who, immediately before the Merger, owned at least 5% of the outstanding stock of FairPoint (by vote or value) or securities of FairPoint with a
tax basis of $1.0 million or more.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following discussion sets forth the principal terms of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex I to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference herein. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and not by this discussion, which is a summary by nature.
This discussion is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement. You are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its
entirety, as well as this joint proxy statement/prospectus, before making any decisions regarding the Merger.

The Merger 

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Delaware law, Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated, will merge with and into
FairPoint. FairPoint will be the surviving company in the Merger and continue its corporate existence as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will terminate.

Closing and Effectiveness of the Merger 

        The closing of the Merger will occur as soon as possible, but no later than two business days after the date of the conditions to its completion have been satisfied or waived. The Merger
will become effective at such time (the "effective time") as set forth in the certificate of merger that the parties will duly execute and file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Appointment of Director Designated by FairPoint 

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, FairPoint is entitled to select, subject to approval by Consolidated (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and
Consolidated has agreed to take all such action as may be reasonably necessary to cause, one individual from among the current members of the FairPoint Board to be elected to the
Consolidated Board as of the effective time of the Merger.

Consideration to be Received in the Merger 

        At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of FairPoint common stock (except shares owned by Consolidated, FairPoint or their subsidiaries) will be converted into the
right to receive 0.7300 shares of common stock of Consolidated. No fractional shares of Consolidated common stock will be issued. Each holder will be entitled to receive, in lieu of any
fractional share of Consolidated common stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled, an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable taxes required to be
withheld), rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share of Consolidated common stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) the last reported sale price of Consolidated common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the effective time of the
Merger.

Treatment of FairPoint Equity Awards 

        Each FairPoint Option, to the extent outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, shall become fully vested as of the effective time of the Merger
and shall, without any action on the part of the holder of such option, be automatically cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective
time of the Merger, that number of shares of Consolidated common stock as is equal to (i) the product of (A) the adjusted option shares (as defined below), multiplied by (B) the difference of
(1) the per share closing price for

Table of Contents

Consolidated common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date, minus (2) the adjusted exercise price (as defined
below), divided by (ii) the per share closing price for Consolidated common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date
(the "option consideration"); provided, however, that in the event that the adjusted exercise price of any FairPoint Option is equal to or greater than the per share closing price for Consolidated
common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date, such FairPoint Option shall be canceled and no option
consideration shall be payable in respect of such FairPoint Option. The term "adjusted exercise price" means, with respect to each FairPoint Option, the quotient of (A) the exercise price set
forth in such FairPoint Option, in each case as adjusted to the date of such calculation in accordance with the terms of such FairPoint Option, divided by (B) 0.7300. The term "adjusted option
shares" means, with respect to each FairPoint Option, the product of (A) the number of shares of FairPoint common stock underlying such FairPoint Option, in each case as adjusted to the date
of such calculation in accordance with the terms of such FairPoint Option, multiplied by (B) 0.7300.

        Each FairPoint Performance Award, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, shall become 100% fully vested as of the effective time of the Merger
and shall, without any action on the part of any holder of such FairPoint Performance Award, be automatically canceled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the effective time of the Merger, that number of shares of Consolidated common stock as is equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of FairPoint common stock underlying
such FairPoint Performance Award, multiplied by (ii) 0.7300.

        Restricted share awards granted under any FairPoint stock plan, to the extent outstanding and subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions (whether time-based or performance-based), shall
become fully vested or released from such forfeiture conditions as of the effective time of the Merger and shall be treated as shares of FairPoint common stock for all purposes of the Merger
Agreement.

Representations and Warranties 

        The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by FairPoint to Consolidated and by Consolidated to FairPoint. The assertions embodied in those representations and
warranties were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, FairPoint's and Consolidated's stockholders should not rely on representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or
circumstances, and should bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, were negotiated for purposes of
allocating contractual risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement rather than to establish matters as facts and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality different from those
generally applicable to disclosure to stockholders. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger
Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be reflected in public disclosures of FairPoint and Consolidated. This description of the representations and warranties is included to
provide FairPoint's and Consolidated's stockholders with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the
description of them in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings FairPoint and Consolidated
publicly file with the SEC. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 151.

No Solicitation; Changes in Recommendations 

        In the Merger Agreement, FairPoint has agreed that the FairPoint Board will recommend that FairPoint's stockholders approve the FairPoint Merger Proposal, and that none of FairPoint,
the FairPoint Board or any of its subsidiaries will, nor will any of FairPoint, the FairPoint Board or any of its subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its representatives to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, an alternative proposal (as defined below), including through the furnishing of non-public information; 

• furnish any non-public information relating to FairPoint or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information of FairPoint or any of its subsidiaries, relating to an alternative proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that could lead to an alternative proposal;

discussions or negotiations with, furnish non-public information, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information and access to FairPoint's

• prior to furnishing such information or access to, or entering into substantive discussions or negotiations with, such person, FairPoint receives a confidentiality agreement that
meets terms specified in the Merger Agreement, and FairPoint notifies Consolidated that it intends to furnish information or access to, or intends to enter into substantive
discussions or negotiations with, such person.

        In addition, at any time prior to obtaining FairPoint's stockholder approval, if FairPoint is then in receipt of a bona fide written alternative proposal that the FairPoint Board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a superior proposal or if there occurs any fiduciary change (as defined below), the FairPoint Board
may:

• effect a company recommendation change; and/or 

• in the case of superior proposal, adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend to the stockholders of FairPoint, any
superior proposal and authorize FairPoint to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal (provided,
however, that in the circumstances described in this bullet point, FairPoint concurrently terminates the Merger Agreement, pays the termination fee if, when, and as required by
the Merger Agreement and enters into a definitive alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal).

        In the circumstances set forth in the foregoing paragraph, the FairPoint Board may effect a company recommendation change, if and only if:

• the FairPoint Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of FairPoint under applicable laws; and 

• FairPoint shall have validly terminated the Merger Agreement and paid the termination fee in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and prior to terminating the Merger
Agreement, FairPoint shall have given Consolidated at least three business days' notice (or shorter period specified in the Merger Agreement for material revisions to the
superior proposal) thereof, attaching the alternative proposal agreement, and if, within such three business day period (or such shorter period) Consolidated makes an offer that
the FairPoint Board determines in good

faith is more favorable to the stockholders of FairPoint, from a financial point of view, than such superior proposal, and agrees in writing to all adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement to reflect such offer, FairPoint's notice of termination with respect to such superior proposal shall be deemed to be rescinded and of no
further force and effect and, if FairPoint has entered into a superior proposal agreement, it must promptly terminate such agreement.

        The term "alternative proposal" means, any proposal, indication or offer, including any proposal, indication or offer from or to FairPoint's stockholders, made by any person or group (as
defined under Rule 13(d) under the Exchange Act) other than Consolidated or its subsidiaries and/or affiliates relating to, whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions, and
whether directly or indirectly, any (i) transaction or series of transactions (including any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, joint venture,
partnership, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar direct or indirect transaction involving FairPoint and/or any of its subsidiaries) for the issuance or acquisition of shares of
FairPoint common stock or other equity securities of FairPoint whose business or businesses constitute 20% (in number or voting power) or more of the assets, revenues or earnings of
FairPoint and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) acquisition, license or purchase of assets of FairPoint and/or its subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the consolidated assets of FairPoint
and its subsidiaries or to which 20% or more of FairPoint's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable or (iii) acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d)
under the Exchange Act) of equity interests representing a 20% or greater economic or voting interest in FairPoint or tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) under the Exchange Act) beneficially owning equity interests representing a 20% (in number or voting power)
or greater economic or voting interest in FairPoint (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that a transfer of FairPoint common stock solely as part of the exercise of registration rights applicable
to the FairPoint common stock in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement shall not be considered an alternative proposal).

        The term "fiduciary change" means any determination by the FairPoint Board, prior to obtaining FairPoint's stockholder approval of the Merger, that it is obligated to make a company
recommendation change because such a change is advisable to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders of FairPoint.

        The term "superior proposal" means any bona fide alternative proposal (except that references to "20% or more" in the definition thereof will be deemed to be references to "50% or
more") made by any person that is on terms that the FairPoint Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) and after taking into
account all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal are more favorable to FairPoint's stockholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

        The Merger Agreement provides that FairPoint shall notify Consolidated if any alternative proposals are received by FairPoint indicating, in connection with such notice, the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter FairPoint must keep
Consolidated reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any material amendments thereto), including any change in
FairPoint's intentions as previously notified. In addition, FairPoint must promptly notify Consolidated if any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, FairPoint indicating, in connection with such notice, the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the FairPoint's
intentions as previously notified.

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Complete the Merger; Other Agreements 

        Commercially Reasonable Efforts.    Consolidated and FairPoint have each agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) to promptly prepare, file and
provide to third parties and governmental entities all applications, statements, notices, petitions, registrations, requests, declarations and filings which are necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger and the issuance of Consolidated common stock in connection with the Merger), to obtain (and to cooperate with
the other party to obtain) as promptly as practicable all material permits, consents, registrations, authorizations and exemptions of or from all third parties and governmental entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger and the issuance of Consolidated common stock in connection with the
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, registrations, authorizations and exemptions of all such third parties and governmental entities, provided
that these agreements do not apply to the debt financing, which is governed by other provisions of the Merger Agreement.

        Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement; Stockholders' Meeting.    Consolidated and FairPoint have agreed to prepare and file with the SEC this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part as soon as is reasonably practicable after the execution of the Merger
Agreement. Consolidated and FairPoint have also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC and kept effective at all times
through the effective time of the Merger in order to permit consummation of the Merger. The Merger Agreement also provides that Consolidated and FairPoint will each hold a meeting of their
respective stockholders following SEC clearance of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and will recommend, in the case of FairPoint, the approval of the FairPoint Merger Proposal by its
stockholders and, in the case of Consolidated, the approval of the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal by its stockholders, and FairPoint and Consolidated will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such approvals.

Access to Information 

        Under the Merger Agreement, until the effective time of the Merger, subject to reasonable prior notice, applicable law and the confidentiality agreement between FairPoint and
Consolidated dated August 19, 2016, FairPoint and Consolidated agree to provide their respective authorized representatives access to the properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of FairPoint, Consolidated, and the subsidiaries of each.

Covenants and Agreements with Respect to the Debt Financing 

        Under the Merger Agreement, among other things, Consolidated and Merger Sub agreed to take all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
(x) maintain in effect the debt commitment letter and (y) arrange and obtain the proceeds of the debt financing on the terms and conditions described in the debt commitment letter (including
any "market flex" terms and conditions in the fee letter referenced in, and to which, the debt commitment letter is subject), including: (i) entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto
on the terms and conditions contained in the debt commitment letter as promptly as practicable; and (ii) satisfying, or cause the representatives of Consolidated and Merger Sub to satisfy all
conditions applicable to Consolidated, Merger Sub, any subsidiary of Consolidated or their respective representatives that are within their respective control in such definitive agreements.
Consolidated also agreed not to amend, modify or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision under the debt commitment letter without prior

written consent of FairPoint if such amendments, modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the debt financing or (ii) impose new or additional conditions that would
reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or materially delay the ability of Consolidated to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
(B) adversely impact the ability of Consolidated, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Consolidated to enforce its rights against the other parties to the debt commitment letter. FairPoint agreed to
cooperate, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause FairPoint's officers, employees, representatives, auditors, and advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, to cooperate, in
connection with the arrangement of the debt financing, as may be reasonably requested by Consolidated, at Consolidated's sole expense, (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of business of FairPoint and its subsidiaries).

Alternative Financing 

        Under the Merger Agreement, Consolidated agreed that, in the event that any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, (i) Consolidated will promptly notify FairPoint and (ii) Consolidated and Merger Sub will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, and
to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon conditions not less favorable to Consolidated, Merger Sub and FairPoint, taken as a whole, than those in the debt commitment letter ("Alternative
Financing"), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the closing date of the Merger); provided, that if Consolidated agrees to be
subject to the same obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to any Alternative Financing as those with respect to the debt financing. Under the Merger Agreement, Consolidated
is obligated to provide to FairPoint copies of any commitment letter and fee letter associated with an Alternative Financing as well as any amendment or waiver of any debt commitment letter
or fee letter that is permitted under the Merger Agreement.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance 

        The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the effective time of the Merger, each of Consolidated and FairPoint, as the surviving company shall, jointly and severally:

• indemnify and hold harmless the "indemnified parties" (meaning each individual who served as a director or officer of FairPoint or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of
the Merger) to the fullest extent required, authorized or permitted by Delaware law, in connection with any claim and any judgments, fines (including excise taxes), penalties
and amounts paid in settlement resulting therefrom; and 

• promptly pay on behalf of or, within 30 days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the indemnified parties, to the fullest extent required, authorized or
permitted by Delaware law, any expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any claim in advance of the final disposition of
such claim, but in the case of advancement of expenses upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable law, from such indemnified party to repay such
advanced expenses if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such indemnified party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect
to such expenses.

        The Merger Agreement further provides that, prior to the effective time of the Merger, FairPoint shall or, if FairPoint is unable to, Consolidated shall cause the surviving company in the
Merger as of the effective time of the Merger to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of FairPoint's existing
directors' and officers' insurance

policies and FairPoint's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "D&O Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after
the effective time of the Merger with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the effective time of the Merger from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as FairPoint's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under
FairPoint's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of FairPoint by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the effective time of the Merger (including in connection with the Merger Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated thereby), provided that the annual premium therefor shall not exceed $1,718,760. If such "tail policy" cannot be obtained, Consolidated or FairPoint
as the surviving company, as the case may be, is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for
$1,718,760 per year on terms substantially similar to FairPoint's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance.

Employee Matters 

        The Merger Agreement provides that, for a period of one year from and after the effective time of the Merger, Consolidated will provide to those employees of FairPoint and its
subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger who remain employed by Consolidated after the effective time of the Merger (the "continuing employees")
compensation and benefits arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than either the (i) levels of compensation and benefits provided to the continuing employees immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger or (ii) the levels of compensation and benefit arrangements that are provided to similarly situated employees of Consolidated. The Merger Agreement
also provides that Consolidated will give continuing employees who remain employed by Consolidated after the effective time of the Merger, full credit for purposes of determining eligibility
and vesting (but not for purposes of any benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Consolidated (other than any defined benefit or equity-based plans)
for such continuing employee's service with FairPoint or its subsidiaries, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the continuing employees under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Consolidated to the same extent waived by FairPoint and its subsidiaries or
otherwise not subject to limitation by FairPoint and its subsidiaries, provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductible and out-of-pocket expenditures for the
remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs, and honor in accordance with their terms all employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by FairPoint
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.

Definition of Material Adverse Effect 

        Certain of the representations and warranties and provisions relating to conditions to the consummation of the Merger are qualified by "material adverse effect." A "material adverse
effect" is defined with respect to any entity as (i) a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of such entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(ii) a material adverse effect on the ability of such entity to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on a timely basis, excluding any effect on the entity or its
subsidiary relating to or arising in connection with:

• any adverse change, effect, event or occurrence, state of facts or developments to the extent the public announcement or the pendency of the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby or any actions required to be taken (or refrained from being taken) in

Amendment; Extension and Waiver 

        Any provision of the Merger Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the effective time of the Merger if such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to the Merger Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. After the FairPoint stockholder approval has been
obtained, however, there will be no amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of FairPoint's stockholders under Delaware law without such approval having been first
obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain provisions of the Merger Agreement cannot be amended, supplemented, waived or modified in a manner that is materially adverse to any
persons (including without limitation, lenders, agents and arrangers) that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in connection with the debt financing commitment or
alternative debt financings in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (collectively, "Financing Sources") without the prior written consent of such Financing
Sources.

Governing Law; Venue 

        The Merger Agreement is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties to the Merger Agreement have submitted to exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Delaware or of the United States of America. FairPoint and its subsidiaries have also agreed, except as specifically set forth in the debt
financing, (i) that the internal laws of the State of New York will govern any action, cause of action, claim, cross claim or third party claim against Financing Sources and (ii) to submit such
claims to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

First Amendment to Merger Agreement 

        On January 20, 2017, FairPoint, Consolidated and Merger Sub entered into a First Amendment to the Merger Agreement solely to amend Exhibit A thereof, the form of Tenth Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of FairPoint (the "Form of Charter") in order to conform certain provisions of the Form of Charter to FairPoint's Ninth Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, which is currently in effect.

DEBT FINANCING 

General 

        The Merger Agreement is not subject to any financing contingency. Consolidated intends to finance the repayment and redemption of existing indebtedness of FairPoint and pay certain
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the related debt financing with the proceeds of a $935.0 million incremental term
loan facility, with any remaining portion expected to be financed with cash on-hand or other sources of liquidity in an amount to be determined. Consolidated initially obtained a commitment
for the financing necessary to complete the transaction pursuant to a commitment letter, dated December 3, 2016, which is described below. Subsequently, Consolidated entered into two
amendments to its existing credit agreement, pursuant to which a syndicate of lenders agreed to provide an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $935.0 million
under the credit agreement, which is also described below.

Commitment Letter 

        In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Consolidated Communications, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated ("CCI"), entered into a Commitment Letter,
dated December 3, 2016 (the "Commitment Letter"), from (i) Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., (ii) The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., MUFG Securities
Americas Inc. (collectively, "MUFG") and/or any other affiliates or subsidiaries as MUFG collectively deems appropriate to provide the services referred to therein, (iii) TD Securities
(USA) LLC, (iv) The Toronto-Dominion Bank, New York Branch, and (v) Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (collectively, the "Lead Arrangers"). The Commitment Letter provided for a senior secured
incremental term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount that would yield up to $865.0 million in gross proceeds to CCI (the "Incremental Term Loan Facility") and senior unsecured
term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount that would yield up to $70.0 million in gross proceeds to CCI (the "Unsecured Term Loan Facility", together with the Incremental Term
Loan Facility, collectively, the "Term Loan Facilities"). The Term Loan Facilities were to be used to finance, in part, and pay the fees and expenses in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to repay existing indebtedness of FairPoint, with any remaining portion expected to be financed with cash on-hand or other sources of liquidity in
an amount to be determined.

        Also pursuant to the Commitment Letter, the commitments under the Unsecured Term Loan Facility were to be automatically and permanently reduced to zero and cancelled if, within
90 days following the date of the Commitment Letter, CCI obtained an amendment, reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Arrangers, to the terms of the Credit Agreement (and such amendment
went effective within such period) (the "Amendment") allowing for an additional aggregate amount of at least $70.0 million to be incurred as a senior secured incremental term loan credit
facility pursuant to Section 2.21 of the Credit Agreement and the commitments to provide the Incremental Term Loan Facility were to be automatically and permanently increased, on a pro
rata basis, by an amount equal to $70.0 million upon effectiveness of the Amendment.

        On December 14, 2016, Consolidated, CCI, certain other subsidiaries of Consolidated, the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and
other agents party thereto entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement reflecting the foregoing terms, and as a result thereof, the Incremental Term Loan Facility was increased
to an aggregate amount of $935.0 million.

Incremental Term Loan 

        On December 21, 2016, Consolidated and certain of its subsidiaries, including CCI, entered into an Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to
Amendment No. 2,

Table of Contents

subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, a syndicate of lenders has agreed to provide an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $935.0 million under the Credit
Agreement (the "Incremental Term Loan"). The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan may be used, in part, to repay and redeem certain existing indebtedness of FairPoint in connection with
the Merger transaction and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Merger transaction and the related financing. Amendment No. 2 was entered into in connection with the
Commitment Letter.

        Pricing and other terms of the Incremental Term Loan included the following:

• The terms, conditions and covenants of the Incremental Term Loan are materially consistent with those in the existing Credit Agreement. 

• The maturity date of the Incremental Term Loan is October 5, 2023, provided that unless CCI's 6.50% Senior Notes, which mature on October 1, 2022, are repaid in full or
redeemed in full by March 31, 2022, such maturity date shall be March 31, 2022. 

• The Incremental Term Loan has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% and the greater of (i) the LIBO Rate (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) floor of 1.00 and
(ii) at Consolidated's option, the one, two, three or six-month Adjusted LIBO Rate (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement). The Incremental Term Loan included an
original issue discount of 0.50%, which represents a significant reduction from both the interest rate on FairPoint's existing term loan facility of approximately 7.50% and the
interest rate on FairPoint's existing note facility of 8.75%. 

• The Incremental Term Loan is secured on a pari passu basis with the existing credit facilities under the Credit Agreement. 

• Ticking fees will start accruing to the lenders providing the Incremental Term Loan commitments on January 15, 2017, at the rate equal to the interest rate of the Incremental
Term Loan.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements ("pro forma financial statements") have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X to
reflect the Merger, based on the acquisition method of accounting, with Consolidated treated as the acquirer. The pro forma financial statements utilize the historical consolidated financial
statements of Consolidated and FairPoint, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to
give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Merger and factually supportable and, in the case of the statement of income, that are expected to have a continuing impact.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income, which have been prepared for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, give
effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared as of September 30, 2016 and gives effect to the
Merger as if it had occurred on that date.

        As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Consolidated has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required fair market value of the FairPoint
assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has it identified all adjustments necessary to conform FairPoint to Consolidated's
accounting policies. The pro forma adjustments related to the Merger are based upon preliminary estimates, and are pending the completion of the valuations of the tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As indicated in Note 2 to the pro forma financial statements, Consolidated has made certain pro forma adjustments to the historical book values of the
assets and liabilities of FairPoint to reflect certain preliminary estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired, with the excess of the estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value
of FairPoint's acquired assets and assumed liabilities recorded as goodwill. Actual results are expected to differ from these preliminary estimates once Consolidated has determined the final
purchase price for FairPoint, has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the fair value estimates and identified any necessary conforming accounting policy changes for FairPoint.
There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.

        These pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with Consolidated's and FairPoint's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, incorporated
by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        The pro forma financial statements are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the combined company that would have
been reported had the Merger been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the
combined company.

        The pro forma financial statements do not include the realization of future cost savings or synergies or restructuring charges that are expected to result from the Merger.

1.     Description of the Transaction

        On December 3, 2016, Consolidated, Merger Sub and FairPoint entered into the Merger Agreement, which provides for, among other things, the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and FairPoint will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated.

        At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of FairPoint issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
will be converted into and become the right to receive 0.7300 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Consolidated and cash in lieu of fractional shares, as set forth in the
Merger Agreement.

        The Merger is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) approval by Consolidated's stockholders and FairPoint's stockholders, (ii) the waiting
period under the HSR Act has expired or has been terminated (this condition has been satisfied. See the section entitled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger—United
States Antitrust" on page 93), (iii) specified federal and state regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any order, injunction, statute, rule, regulation or decree prohibiting, precluding,
restraining, enjoining or making illegal the consummation of the Merger, (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party, (vi) performance, in all material respects, of all
obligations and compliance with, in all material respects, agreements and covenants to be performed or complied with by each party, (vii) declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Consolidated, (viii) FairPoint holding a minimum cash amount as of the effective time of the Merger, and (ix) the approval of the listing of additional
shares of Consolidated common stock to be issued to FairPoint's stockholders. The Merger is expected to close by mid-2017.

        Consolidated and FairPoint have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including FairPoint agreeing not to solicit alternative transactions
or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, an alternative transaction. The Merger Agreement contains certain
termination rights for both Consolidated and FairPoint, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, FairPoint may be obligated to pay
Consolidated a termination fee of $18,900 and, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances, Consolidated may be obligated to pay FairPoint a termination fee
of $18,900.

2.     Basis of Presentation

        Consolidated will account for its acquisition of FairPoint using the acquisition method of accounting, with Consolidated treated as the acquirer. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 give effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared as of September 30, 2016 and gives effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on that date. Certain reclassifications
have been made to the historical financial statements of FairPoint to conform to the financial statement presentation of Consolidated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements do not reflect any other adjustments to conform the accounting policies and presentation of the two companies. The final results of the complete review of accounting policies and
presentation may result in identifying differences that, when conformed, could have a material effect on the combined financial statements.

        The pro forma adjustments reflect preliminary estimates of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, which are expected to change
upon

finalization of appraisals and other valuation studies. The final pro forma adjustments will be based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities that will exist
as of the effective time of the Merger. The final adjustments could be materially different from the pro forma adjustments presented herein.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income include certain accounting adjustments related to the Merger that are expected to have a continuing impact on the
combined results, including adjustments for depreciation and amortization on the acquired tangible and intangible assets, interest expense on the debt expected to be incurred to complete the
Merger, amortization of deferred financing fees incurred in connection with the new borrowings and the tax impact of these pro forma adjustments.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect certain adjustments that are expected to result from the Merger that may be significant, such as costs
that may be incurred by Consolidated for integration and restructuring efforts, as well as payments under certain change in control agreements or other contingent payments to certain FairPoint
employees, because they are considered to be of a non-recurring nature.

        Upon completion of the Merger or shortly thereafter, various triggering events will have occurred which will result in the payment of various change in control payments and other
contingent payments to certain FairPoint employees. The estimated cash payments under these agreements will range from approximately $7,000 to $9,000 and have been included as a pro
forma adjustment in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. No adjustment has been included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statements of income for these payments since they are considered to be non-recurring.

        The summary pro forma financial information does not include the realization of future cost savings or synergies or restructuring charges that are expected to result from the Merger. The
transaction is expected to generate annual operating synergies of approximately $55,000, which are expected to be achieved on a run-rate basis by the end of the second year after close.
However, no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate amount of such synergies or costs or the timing of their realization. Consolidated also expects to incur merger and integration
costs over the first two years following the close.

3.     Preliminary Purchase Consideration and Related Allocation

        The following is the calculation of the preliminary purchase price for the acquisition of FairPoint:

        The estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a preliminary basis are as follows:

        For purposes of preparing the pro forma financial statements, the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are based on their preliminary estimated fair value
as of September 30, 2016. The final amount recorded will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired

(b) Represents the product of the estimated number of shares of Consolidated common stock to be issued and the closing price of Consolidated common stock
as of February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the final purchase price will be based on the number of shares of FairPoint common stock and equity awards outstanding and the price of
Consolidated's common stock as of the closing date of the Merger. Therefore, the estimated consideration expected to be transferred as reflected in these
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements does not purport to represent what the actual consideration transferred will be when the
Merger is completed. An increase or decrease by 10% in Consolidated's common stock price as of the closing day of business on February 16, 2017, the
last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, ($25.72 per share) would increase or decrease the consideration
expected to be transferred by approximately $55,600, which would be reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements as
an increase or decrease to goodwill. 

(c) As of February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, there were 3,582,402 FairPoint warrants
outstanding, each eligible to purchase one share of FairPoint common stock at an exercise price of $48.81 per share. In connection with the Merger, each
outstanding warrant to purchase shares of FairPoint common stock will convert into a warrant to acquire shares of Consolidated common stock, on the
same terms and condition that were applicable to such FairPoint warrant, except that the number of shares of Consolidated common stock for which such
warrant may be exercisable and the exercise price of the warrant will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. Accordingly, after the Merger, there are
expected to be approximately 2,615,153 Consolidated warrants outstanding, each eligible to purchase one share of Consolidated common stock at an
exercise price of $66.86 per share. These warrants are not considered part of the purchase price consideration as their estimated fair value is expected to be
zero.

and liabilities assumed at the completion of the Merger and could vary significantly from the pro forma amounts due to various factors, including but not limited to, changes in the share price
of Consolidated's common stock, the composition of FairPoint's assets, liabilities including the amount of debt outstanding, outstanding equity ownership shares and changes in fair value
assumptions prior to the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, the preliminary estimated fair values of the purchase price and the assets and liabilities recorded are subject to change pending
additional information that may be developed by Consolidated and FairPoint. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be
recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill.

4.     Pro Forma Adjustments—Statements of Income

        The following pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
December 31, 2015 give effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015:

(a) Depreciation and Amortization 

The pro forma adjustments to depreciation and amortization reflect the removal of the historical basis of depreciation and amortization for the FairPoint assets and the
recognition of the new depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the Merger, based on their estimated fair
value. The following table summarizes the pro forma adjustments to depreciation and amortization:

(b) Interest Expense 

The pro forma adjustments to interest expense, as summarized in the following table, reflect the removal of historical interest expense of FairPoint and the additional interest
expense resulting from the new borrowings to finance the Merger, as described below. The pro forma adjustments are based on the amounts borrowed and the interest rates
assumed to be in effect at the closing of the Merger.

Table of Contents

In connection with the Merger, on December 21, 2016, Consolidated entered into an amendment to its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 5,
2016 (the "Credit Agreement") in which a syndicate of lenders has agreed to provide an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $935.0 million under
the Credit Agreement (the "Incremental Term Loan"), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan may be used, in part, to repay
and redeem certain existing indebtedness of FairPoint and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Merger and the related financing. The terms, conditions and
covenants of the Incremental Term Loan are materially consistent with those in the existing Credit Agreement. The Incremental Term Loan included an original issue discount
of 0.50% and has an interest rate of 3.00% plus LIBOR based on the one-month adjusted rate subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor.

The pro forma adjustments reflect the elimination of historical interest expense of FairPoint related to the settlement of its debt through the issuance of the Incremental Term
Loan as if such events had occurred on January 1, 2015. For all periods presented, pro forma interest expense includes the amortization of the discount of $4,675 and expected
financing costs of approximately $3,635 related to the issuance of the Incremental Term Loan based on a term of 6.5 years. The Incremental Term Loan has an assumed interest
rate of 4.00% which is based on 3.00% plus the LIBOR floor of 1.00% as one-month LIBOR on February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, was below the LIBOR floor. As of February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, an
increase or decrease of 0.125% in the variable interest rate on the Incremental Term Loan facility would not impact annual pro forma interest expense for the year ended
December 31, 2015 or the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the LIBOR floor.

(c) Income Tax Expense 

The blended effective tax rate applied to the pro forma adjustments related to the Merger and related financing is 40% for the periods presented.

(d) Earnings Per Share 

The pro forma adjustment reflects the change in outstanding shares to calculate basic and dilutive earnings per share based on the Merger:

5.     Pro Forma Adjustments—Balance Sheet

        The following are the pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and give effect to the Merger as if it had
occurred on that date:

(a) Reclassifications 

Certain amounts included in FairPoint's historical condensed consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of Consolidated's financial
statements. The pro forma adjustments reflect the reclassification of advance billings and customer deposits from accrued expense.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Pro forma adjustments to cash are the result of proceeds from the issuance of debt, cash used to fund the acquisition of FairPoint, estimated transaction costs and costs
associated with entering into the Incremental Term Loan. Following is a preliminary estimate of net cash used for the Merger:

(c) Fair Value Estimates 

The pro forma adjustments reflect the preliminary estimated fair values for the net assets to be acquired. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to change upon
completion of the valuation process.

Goodwill reflects the preliminary estimate of the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and is not be
amortized but will be assessed at least annually for impairment. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Based on the preliminary valuation analysis, the identified intangible assets to be acquired include trade names, customer relationships and contracts. The fair value estimate of
the identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using the income approach, which requires a forecast of all the expected future cash flows. Since all of the information
required to perform a detailed valuation analysis of FairPoint's intangible assets could not be obtained as of the date of this filing, for purposes of these unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements, the assumptions used are based on available information provided by FairPoint as well as industry data to develop the estimated fair
value of the identifiable intangible assets. In addition, useful lives have been estimated for each category of identifiable intangible assets, which range from 1 to 7 years. The
assumptions include a straight line

amortization method of the intangibles as part of the preliminary valuation. Upon completion of the final valuation, the fair values and useful lives assigned to the identifiable
intangible assets could change and any change in fair value will result in a corresponding change to the estimated goodwill used in these unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements.

(d) Debt 

The pro forma adjustments to reflect the payment and incurrence of debt are as follows:

(e) Income Taxes 

The pro forma adjustments reflect the income tax impact assuming a marginal combined state and federal tax rate of approximately 40% of the pro forma adjustments resulting
from the Merger. The pro forma adjustment to long-term deferred tax liabilities reflect the change in fair value of the net assets to be acquired.

(f) Stockholders' Equity 

The pro forma stockholders' equity reflects the following adjustments:

Transaction costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Merger have not been assessed for deductibility for income tax purposes and accordingly are assumed to be
nondeductible for pro forma purposes.

filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in
office, regardless of whether such directors fulfill
quorum requirements, or by a sole remaining director,
or by stockholders at a meeting of stockholders at
which members of the FairPoint Board are to be
elected pursuant to FairPoint's notice of meeting or the
bylaws. FairPoint's bylaws provide that any director
may be removed at any time, with or without cause,
upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the combined voting power of the then outstanding
capital stock of FairPoint entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors.

 
Consolidated's stockholders do not have cumulative

provide that vacancies on the Consolidated Board may
be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then
in office (subject to the terms of any preferred stock).
The Consolidated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws provide that directors may be removed at any
time, but only for cause, by vote of 662/3% of the
outstanding common stock (subject to the terms of any
preferred stock).

Limitation of Personal Liability

and Indemnification of Directors
and Officers

 Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify any
directors, officers, employees and agents of the
corporation against expenses and, except in the case of
an action by or in the right of the corporation,
liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding involving such person by reason of the fact
that the person is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation, provided that (i) such
person acted in good faith and in a manner the person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, such person had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful
and (ii) in the case of an action by or in the right of the
corporation, no indemnification of expenses may be
made in respect of any matter as to which such person
is adjudged liable to the corporation unless and only to
the extent such indemnification is approved by a court.
Delaware law mandates such indemnification of
expenses to the extent that a present or former director
or officer of the corporation has been successful in
defense of any proceeding described above, and
permits advancement of expenses to a director or
officer if the corporation receives an undertaking that
the amount advanced will be repaid if it is determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Delaware law also provides that the permitted
indemnifications described above are not exclusive.

 Delaware law also permits a corporation to include in

its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating
or limiting the personal liability of a director of a
corporation to the corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, provided that such provision shall not
eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any
breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the
corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(iii) for acts relating to unlawful payment of a dividend
or an unlawful stock purchase or redemption or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

 Delaware law also permits a corporation to include in
its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating
or limiting the personal liability of a director of a
corporation to the corporation or its stockholders for

(iii) for acts relating to unlawful payment of a dividend
or an unlawful stock purchase or redemption or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

 
The FairPoint certificate of incorporation provides that
the personal liability of the directors of FairPoint is
eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
law. The FairPoint bylaws require indemnification, to
the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, of any
person who was or is made a party or is threatened to
be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom
he or she is the legal representative is or was, the chief
executive officer, the president or any executive vice
president, senior vice president or vice president or a
director of FairPoint, whether the basis of such
proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity
as such an officer or a director, or in any other capacity
while serving as such an officer or director, against all
expense, liability and loss incurred or suffered by such
person in connection therewith. Further, the FairPoint
bylaws provide that FairPoint may maintain insurance
to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or
agent of FairPoint or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss, whether or not FairPoint
would have the power to indemnify such person
against such expense, liability or loss under Delaware
law.

 
The Consolidated certificate of incorporation provides
that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law
and except as otherwise provided in the Consolidated
bylaws, none of Consolidated's directors will be liable
to Consolidated or its stockholders for monetary
damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director. In
addition, the Consolidated certificate of incorporation
and by-laws permit indemnification of any person who
was or is made, or threatened to be made, a party to
any action, suit or other proceeding, whether criminal,
civil, administrative or investigative, because of his or
her status as a director or officer of Consolidated, or
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise at Consolidated's request to the fullest
extent authorized under Delaware law against all
expenses, liabilities and losses reasonably incurred by
such person. The Consolidated bylaws provide that
such indemnification must be provided to directors and
officers of Consolidated. Further, the Consolidated
bylaws provide that Consolidated may purchase and
maintain insurance on Consolidated's own behalf and
on behalf of any other person who is or was a director,
officer or agent of Consolidated or was serving at
Consolidated's request as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise.

  FairPoint  Consolidated
Exclusive Forum for the Resolution

of Certain Disputes
 Neither the FairPoint bylaws nor the certificate of

incorporation provide for an exclusive forum in
connection with any dispute.

 The Consolidated bylaws provide that, unless
Consolidated consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the state and federal courts located
within the State of Delaware will be the sole and
exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation,
(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty against a director, officer or other
employee of the corporation, (iii) any action asserting
a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware
law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by
the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the
court's having personal jurisdiction over the
indispensable parties named as defendants. The
Consolidated bylaws further provide that any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in
shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
exclusive forum bylaws provision.

Registration Rights
 

FairPoint is a party to registration rights agreement
which provides that Angelo Gordon and certain
entities advised by Angelo Gordon have certain
registration rights, including the right to demand that
FairPoint file a registration statement (known as
"demand" registration rights) or request that their
shares of common stock be covered by a registration
statement that FairPoint is otherwise filing (known as
"piggyback" registration rights). These registration
rights will terminate upon the consummation of the
Merger.

 
Consolidated is not party to any agreement granting
registration rights to holders of its common stock.

Warrant Rights
 

As of February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading
day prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, there were 3,582,402 FairPoint
Warrants outstanding.

 
In connection with the Merger, each outstanding
FairPoint warrant will be converted into a warrant to
acquire shares of Consolidated common stock, on the
same terms and conditions that were applicable to such
FairPoint Warrant, except that the number of shares of
Consolidated common stock for which such FairPoint
Warrant may be exercisable and the exercise price of
such FairPoint Warrant will be adjusted to reflect the
exchange ratio. Accordingly, after the Merger, there
are expected to be approximately 2,615,153
Consolidated warrants outstanding, each eligible to
purchase one share of Consolidated common stock at
an exercise price of $66.86 per share.

  FairPoint  Consolidated
Provisions Relating to Stock

Ownership and Federal and State
Communications Laws

 The FairPoint certificate of incorporation provides that
so long as FairPoint or any of its subsidiaries holds any
authorization, license, permit, order, filing or consent
from the Federal Communications Commission or any
state or territorial regulatory commission, or the
regulatory commission of the District of Columbia,
having jurisdiction over FairPoint or any of its
subsidiaries, the FairPoint Board may request
information from any stockholder or person presenting
any shares of capital stock of FairPoint for transfer into
its name (a "transferee") to determine whether the
ownership of, or the existence or exercise of any rights
with respect to, shares of capital stock of FairPoint by
such stockholder or transferee violates any provision
of the communications laws and such stockholder or
transferee is required to furnish promptly to the
FairPoint Board such information as the FairPoint
Board shall reasonably request.

 Neither the Consolidated certificate of incorporation
nor the Consolidated bylaws contain any provisions
relating to stock ownership and Federal and State
Communications Laws.

 
The FairPoint certificate of incorporation further
provides that if any stockholder or transferee from
whom information is reasonably requested should fail
to respond to any such request for information made
by the FairPoint Board described above, or if the
FairPoint Board, based on written advice of outside
regulatory counsel, reasonably concludes in good faith
that the ownership of, or existence or exercise of any
rights of stock ownership with respect to, shares of
capital stock of FairPoint by such FairPoint
stockholder or transferee would violate any provision
of the communications laws, FairPoint (by majority
vote of the FairPoint Board), upon reasonable prior
written notice to such FairPoint stockholder or
transferee, may suspend those rights of stock
ownership the existence or exercise of which would
result in such communications laws violation, such
suspension to remain in effect until such requested
information has been received or the existence or
exercise of such suspended rights would not result in
such communications laws violation; provided,
however, that such rights may be suspended only to the
minimum extent necessary so that such
communications laws violation would not exist; and
provided, further, that FairPoint, in cooperation with
the affected stockholder or transferee, shall take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate or eliminate
the communications laws violation by filing and
prosecuting before the Federal Communications
Commission or state or territorial regulatory
commission, or the regulatory commission of the
District of Columbia, as the case may be, a request for
waiver or declaratory ruling or such other relief as
necessary or appropriate.

Who Can Vote at the FairPoint Special Meeting 

        Only holders of record of FairPoint common stock, as of the close of business on February 17, 2017, which is the record date for the FairPoint special meeting, are entitled to receive
notice of and to vote at the FairPoint special meeting. If you own shares that are registered in the name of someone else, such as a broker, you need to direct that person to vote those shares or
obtain an authorization from them and vote the shares yourself at the FairPoint special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were a total of 50,605,844 shares of
FairPoint common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the FairPoint special meeting. You get one vote for each share of FairPoint common stock that you own. Holders of shares of
common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.

Warrants to Purchase Shares of FairPoint Common Stock 

        As of February 16, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, there were 3,582,402 FairPoint warrants outstanding, each eligible to
purchase one share of FairPoint common stock at an exercise price of $48.81 per share. In connection with the Merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of FairPoint common stock
will be converted into a warrant to acquire shares of Consolidated common stock, on the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such FairPoint warrant, except that the number of
shares of Consolidated common stock for which such warrant may be exercisable and the exercise price of the warrant will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. Accordingly, after the
Merger, there are expected to be approximately 2,615,153 Consolidated warrants outstanding, each eligible to purchase one share of Consolidated common stock at an exercise price of $66.86
per share.

Vote Required 

• The FairPoint Merger Proposal.  The FairPoint Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of FairPoint's common stock
entitled to vote on such proposal. Because the required votes are based upon the number of outstanding shares entitled to vote and not based on the number of outstanding
shares entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the FairPoint special meeting, failure to submit a proxy or vote in person will have the same effect as
a vote "AGAINST" the FairPoint Merger Proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect. 

• The FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal.  The FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on FairPoint, and
failure to receive the vote required for approval will not in itself change FairPoint's obligations to make the change in control payments. Failures to vote and broker non-votes, if
any, will have no effect on this proposal. Abstentions, if any, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal. 

• The FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.  The FairPoint Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal. Failures to vote and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on this proposal. Abstentions, if any, will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

Quorum 

        FairPoint will hold the FairPoint special meeting if stockholders representing the required quorum of shares of common stock entitled to vote either sign and return their proxy card by
mail, deliver their proxy via the Internet at the website provided in the proxy materials, deliver their proxy via the toll

free number provided on the proxy card or attend the FairPoint special meeting. FairPoint's bylaws provide that holders of one-third in voting power of the capital stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the FairPoint special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the FairPoint special meeting. If you submit a proxy, whether by
Internet, telephone or mail, your shares will be counted to determine whether we have a quorum even if you abstain or fail to vote as indicated on the proxy card. Broker non-votes will not
count towards the quorum requirement.

        If a quorum is not present, the person presiding over the FairPoint special meeting may adjourn the meeting to reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice need not be given of any
such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the FairPoint special meeting at which the adjournment is taken and in a press release issued in FairPoint's customary
manner (with a copy posted on FairPoint's website).

How Votes are Counted 

        You may vote "FOR", "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" on each of the proposals.

        If you properly return or submit your proxy but do not indicate how you wish to vote, FairPoint will count your proxy as voted as the FairPoint Board recommends. Therefore, your proxy
will be counted as a vote:

• "FOR" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• "FOR" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

        A failure to vote will:

• be treated as a vote "AGAINST" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• have no effect on the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• have no effect on the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

        An abstention could prevent the approval of the proposals, because it does not count as an affirmative vote. Further, because an abstention represents a share present and entitled to vote, it
is included in the denominator in determining the percentage approved. Therefore, abstentions have the same effect as a vote:

• "AGAINST" the FairPoint Merger Proposal, 

• "AGAINST" the FairPoint Change in Control Payments Proposal, and 

• "AGAINST" the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal.

        A broker "non-vote" occurs on a proposal when shares held of record by a broker are present or represented at a stockholder meeting but the broker is not permitted to vote on that
proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction has been given. Brokerage firms have the authority under the NYSE rules to cast votes on certain
"routine" matters if they do not receive instructions from their customers, but they do not have the authority to vote on "non-routine" matters. The FairPoint Merger Proposal, the FairPoint
Change in Control Payments Proposal and the FairPoint Adjournment Proposal are considered "non-routine" matters. Therefore, if you do not instruct your broker to vote your shares of
FairPoint common stock, your shares will not be voted on at the FairPoint special meeting. To the extent there are broker non-votes, they will:

        You can change your vote before the FairPoint special meeting. If you are a FairPoint stockholder of record, you may change your proxy voting instructions in any of the following ways:

• by sending a written notice to the corporate secretary of FairPoint that is received prior to the FairPoint special meeting, stating that you revoke your proxy;

• by attending the FairPoint special meeting and voting your shares.

        You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the FairPoint special meeting, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or

card and voting instruction form that you receive or vote by telephone or Internet with respect to each proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive.

same family) unless such company has received contrary instructions from an affected stockholder. FairPoint does not offer "householding" for stockholders of record. Please contact your
broker if you are not a stockholder of record to find out if your broker offers "householding."

THE CONSOLIDATED SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Place 

        The Consolidated special meeting will be held on March 28, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., Central time, at Consolidated's corporate headquarters, 121 South 17th Street, Mattoon, Illinois 61938.

Purpose of the Consolidated Special Meeting 

        The Consolidated special meeting will be held for the purpose of considering and acting upon the following matters:

• the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal; and 

• the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Required Vote; Quorum 

        The Consolidated Board has fixed the close of business on February 17, 2017 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Consolidated
special meeting.

        Only stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date, February 17, 2017, are entitled to receive notice of the Consolidated special meeting and to vote the shares of
common stock that they held on that date at the meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.

        Each outstanding share of Consolidated common stock entitles its holder to cast one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Consolidated special meeting. The vote required for each
of (i) the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal and (ii) the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal is the approval of a majority of the votes present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on
the matter.

        A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold the Consolidated special meeting. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of common
stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. As of February 17, 2017, the record date, 50,605,844 shares of Consolidated common stock were outstanding. Proxies received
but marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered present at the meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
included in the calculation of the number of shares considered present at the meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum In the event that a quorum is not present at the Consolidated special
meeting, Consolidated expects that the Consolidated special meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies.

        Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote:

• "AGAINST" the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal, and 

• "AGAINST" the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal.

        A broker "non-vote" occurs on a proposal when shares held of record by a broker are present or represented at a stockholder meeting but the broker is not permitted to vote on that
proposal without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction has been given. Brokerage firms have the authority under the NYSE rules to cast votes on certain
"routine" matters if they do not receive instructions from their customers, but they do not have the authority to vote on "non-routine" matters. The Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal and
the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal are considered "non-routine" matters. Therefore, broker non-votes will:

• have no effect on the Consolidated Stock Issuance Proposal, and 

• have no effect on the Consolidated Adjournment Proposal.

        If your shares are held in "street name," you may vote in person at the Consolidated special meeting if you obtain a proxy as described above.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is also the document used by the Consolidated Board to solicit proxies to be used at the Consolidated special meeting. Proxies are solicited by the
Consolidated Board to give all stockholders of record an opportunity to vote on the matters to be presented at the Consolidated special meeting, even if the stockholders cannot attend the

the Merger is completed, Consolidated will issue a maximum of 24,269,616 shares of Consolidated common stock in connection with the Merger. On an as converted basis, the aggregate

Table of Contents

        In addition, the following information must be provided regarding the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made: the name and
address of such stockholder, as it appears on Consolidated's stock transfer books, and of such beneficial owner; the class, series and number of shares of Consolidated which are owned
beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; a representation that the stockholder giving the notice is a stockholder of record and intends to appear in person or by
a qualified representative at the Consolidated annual meeting to bring the business proposed in the notice before the meeting; a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner,
if any, intends or is part of a group which intends to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination; and any other information relating to such stockholder that
would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

FairPoint 

        It is expected that FairPoint will not hold its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders if the Merger is completed. In that case, holders of FairPoint common stock who become holders of
Consolidated common stock as a result of the Merger must submit stockholder proposals to Consolidated in accordance with the procedures described above. FairPoint will hold its 2017
annual meeting of the stockholders only if the Merger is not completed. In that case, any stockholder nominations or proposals for other business intended to be presented at FairPoint's 2017
annual meeting of stockholders must comply with the notice procedures set forth in FairPoint's bylaws and be submitted to FairPoint as set forth below.

        Any proposal or proposals by a FairPoint stockholder submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy card relating to FairPoint's
2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if any, must have been submitted to FairPoint no later than November 30, 2016. However, if FairPoint does hold a 2017 annual meeting of stockholders
and the date of such meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the date of FairPoint's 2016 annual meeting of the stockholders, stockholder proposals for inclusion in the proxy statement
and proxy card must be submitted a reasonable time before FairPoint begins to print and send its proxy materials for such meeting, if any. All such submissions must comply with Rule 14a-8
under the Exchange Act. In addition, stockholders who desire to bring business or submit a proposal (including director nominations) before an annual meeting of FairPoint's stockholders
outside of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (i.e., where such business or proposal will not be included in FairPoint's proxy statement for the annual meeting) must comply with FairPoint's
bylaws, which require, among other things, that such stockholders provide written notice of such business to FairPoint's secretary, which notice must be received not later than the close of
business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting.

        Notices of intention to present proposals at an annual meeting of FairPoint's stockholders should be addressed to FairPoint Communications, Inc., Attn: Secretary, 521 East Morehead
Street, Suite 500, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

        This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 3, 2016 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, and together with all exhibits and
schedules hereto, this "Agreement"), is entered into by and among Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), FairPoint Communications, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Falcon Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

        WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent through the statutory merger of

        WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable for
and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) resolved,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, to recommend that the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable for and in
the best interests of Parent and its stockholders, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance, and

conditions to the Merger;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1.    THE MERGER    

        1.1    The Merger.    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger

2.    EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS    

        2.1    Conversion of Company Capital Stock.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the shares
of Company Common Stock, Parent Stock or any capital stock of Merger Sub:

        (a)   All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held in treasury or owned directly by the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be
cancelled and retired and shall not represent capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be exchanged for the Merger Consideration. Shares of Company Common Stock that

retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 3.2.

        (c)    No Fractional Shares.    No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in respect of shares of Company Common Stock that are to be converted in the Merger into the
right to receive shares of Parent Stock. Each holder of a Certificate (other than holders of Certificates representing Excluded Shares) shall be entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) by (ii) the last reported sale price of Parent Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by the Company and Parent) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the
Effective Time.

        (d)    Adjustments.    If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by reclassification
any shares of Parent Stock, then the Merger Consideration and any dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other dependent
item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

        2.2    Dissenting Shares.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holder's appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon.

        2.3    Treatment of Restricted Stock, Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.    

        (a)   As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock or other right to purchase Company Common Stock under any Company Stock Plan
(each, a "Company Option"), to the extent outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, shall become fully vested and shall, without any action on the part of any holder
thereof, be automatically canceled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, that number of shares of Parent Stock as is equal
to (i) the product of (A) the Adjusted Option Shares, multiplied by (B) the difference of (1) the Closing Date Parent Stock Price, minus (2) the Adjusted Exercise Price, divided by
(ii) the Closing Date Parent Stock

Price (the "Option Consideration"); provided, however, that in the event that the Adjusted Exercise Price of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Closing Date Parent
Stock Price, such Company Option shall be canceled and no Option Consideration shall be payable in respect of such Company Option. As used in this Section 2.3(a):

          (i)  The term "Adjusted Exercise Price" shall mean, with respect to each Company Option, the quotient of (A) the exercise price set forth in such Company Option, in
each case as adjusted to the date of such calculation in accordance with the terms of such Company Option, divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

         (ii)  The term "Adjusted Option Shares" shall mean, with respect to each Company Option, the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option, in each case as adjusted to the date of such calculation in accordance with the terms of such Company Option, multiplied by (B) the
Exchange Ratio.

        (iii)  The term "Closing Date Parent Stock Price" shall mean the per share closing price for Parent Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the trading
day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

        (b)   As of the Effective Time, each performance award granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a "Company Performance Award" and, collectively with the Company
Options, the "Company Equity Awards"), to the extent outstanding immediately prior thereto, shall become fully vested (at the 100% level) and shall, without any action on the part of
any holder thereof, be automatically canceled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, that number of shares of Parent Stock
as is equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Performance Award, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (collectively,
the "Performance Award Consideration" and, together with the Option Consideration, the "Equity Award Consideration").

        (c)   As of the Effective Time, each restricted share award granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a "Company RSA"), to the extent outstanding and subject to vesting or
forfeiture conditions (whether time-based or performance-based), shall become fully vested or released from such forfeiture conditions as of the Effective Time and shall be treated as a
share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement.

        2.4    Legal Entity Restructuring.    If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent provides written notice to the Company of a proposed internal
restructuring plan for the Company and its subsidiaries, Parent and the Company agree to reasonably cooperate and participate in the analysis, development and implementation of the plan.
The Company shall not be required to take any action with respect to such plan that would adversely affect the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code or have an adverse tax or economic effect on the Company or its shareholders or optionholders for a taxable period prior to or including the Effective Time, or have the effect of
materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any regulatory approvals required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.    EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION    

        3.1    Delivery of the Merger Consideration.    Prior to the Effective Time (and, with respect to Parent Stock, from time to time after the Effective Time, as applicable), Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, pursuant to an agreement providing for the matters set forth in this Section 3.1 and such other matters as may be appropriate and the terms of which shall be mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company, an amount in cash and certificates representing shares of Parent Stock sufficient to effect the conversion of each share of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

        3.2    Exchange Procedures.    

        (a)   Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall designate and appoint Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or an Affiliate thereof to act as exchange agent
hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates.

        (b)   Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not more than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock (each such holder, a "Company Common Stock Holder"), (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each Certificate representing any shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Common
Stock Holder shall pass, only upon delivery of the completed letter of transmittal and such Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of each such Certificate in exchange for the total amount of Merger
Consideration that such Company Common Stock Holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such holder's shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock held by a
Company Common Stock Holder shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive the total amount of Merger Consideration to which such Company Common Stock Holder is
entitled in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.

        (c)   Upon surrender by a Company Common Stock Holder to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates representing such holder's shares of Company Common Stock, together with
a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each
Company Common Stock Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (and the Exchange Agent shall mail to such Company Common Stock Holder within ten
(10) Business Days following such surrender): (i) a certificate (or certificates in the aggregate) representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock into which such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with Section 2, and such Certificates so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled, and (ii) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 3.7) equal to (A) the amount of cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c)), if any, into which such holder's shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's properly
surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with Section 2, plus (B) any cash dividends and other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.3.

        3.3    Dividends and Distributions.    No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such
Certificate is surrendered as provided in this Section 3, but provided that, to the extent that any such dividends or distributions are declared with a record date on or after the Effective Time,
such dividends or distributions shall accrue for the account of such holder to be paid as provided in this Section 3.3. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock represented immediately prior to the Effective Time
by such Certificate (i) when any payment or distribution of a certificate representing any share(s) of Parent Stock is made to such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(b) or (c), all dividends and
other distributions payable in respect of such Parent Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid
and (ii) on the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends

and other distributions in respect of Parent Stock, all shares of Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as
if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

        3.4    Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares.    After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and such dividends and other distributions on or in respect of Parent Stock as provided herein or as otherwise provided by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in Section 2.

        3.5    Termination of Fund; No Liability.    At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent
(i) certificates representing shares of Parent Stock and (ii) cash held by the Exchange Agent for payments in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock, in each case, not delivered to holders of
Certificates. Thereafter, holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent, which shall thereafter act as the Exchange Agent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws), as general creditors of Parent with respect to the delivery of the Merger Consideration (including payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock). None of Parent, the
Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person (as defined below) for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means any natural person, firm, corporation, partnership, company, limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association,
Governmental Entity or other entity.

        3.6    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit attesting to that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Company, the delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving
Company may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a certificate representing shares of Parent Stock and/or pay the cash in
lieu of any fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder is entitled, which constitute the total amount of Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of such Certificate as determined
in accordance with Section 2.

        3.7    Withholding Taxes.    Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, the Equity Award Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as the Company, Parent, or
any affiliate (as defined under the Exchange Act (an "Affiliate")) thereof, or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
Parent or the Exchange Agent and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

        3.8    Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.    Without limiting the other provisions of the Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and the Equity Award Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effect of
such change on the Merger Consideration.

4.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    

        Except as set forth in (a) the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (excluding any disclosures
set forth in any section of any such report entitled "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" or any other disclosures included in such filings to the extent that they are forward-looking
in nature) or (b) in the disclosure schedule of the Company delivered to Parent concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (with specific reference to the section of this
Agreement to which the information stated in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates; provided that (i) disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable or relevant to such
other Section and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect), the

        4.1    Corporate Organization.    

        (a)   Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the
case of the good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or limited
liability company power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively,
"Permits") necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such
power or authority or possess Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means (i) a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis;
provided, however, that in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to or
arising in connection with (A) any adverse change, effect, event or occurrence, state of facts or developments to the extent the public announcement or the pendency of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or any actions required to be taken (or refrained from being taken) in compliance herewith or otherwise with the consent of the other party
hereto, including the impact thereof on the relationships of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers, distributors, consultants, employees or independent
contractors or other third parties with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any relationship and including any litigation brought by any stockholder of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) any failure by the Company to meet any projections or forecasts for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are
released) on or after the date hereof (it being understood that this clause (B) does not and shall not be deemed to apply to the underlying cause or causes of any such failure), (C) any
change in federal, state, non-U.S. or local law, regulations, policies or procedures, or interpretations thereof, generally

to the underlying cause or causes of any such changes). As used herein, "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any Person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company or any other entity that is consolidated with such Person for financial reporting purposes.

        (b)   The copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, and similar organizational documents of each its Subsidiaries, which, except as set forth in

Each of the Parent SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the

SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted

made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of
the date hereof, none of the Parent SEC Reports is subject to ongoing SEC review. "Knowledge of the Parent" means the actual knowledge of the directors and executive officers of Parent

Parent. The directors and executive officers of the Parent listed in Section 5.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to have knowledge (actual, constructive or otherwise) of
any fact, event, condition or occurrence known or deemed to be known by any other Person other than as expressly set forth in the foregoing sentence.

Parent Material Adverse Effect) the results of the consolidated operations and changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable), complies in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the related notes,
where applicable) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, as in effect on the date or for the period with respect to which such principles are applied, in all material respects
consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly
pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent required, authorized or permitted by
Delaware law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing
any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but in the case of advancement of Expenses

jurisdiction in a final order that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Expenses. In the event any Claim is brought against any
Indemnified Party, Parent and the Surviving Company shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of such matter, provided that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim (in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder) without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and to the extent the claimant seeks any non-monetary relief (including any admission of liability or guilt)
from such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to control the defense of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel
of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to Parent and Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense thereof; provided, that Parent shall not be liable for the fees
of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest shall be caused thereby. The indemnification and advancement obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including,
but not limited to, any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board and the Company's stockholders and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the benefit of such individual's heirs, executors and personal and
legal representatives. In connection with any determination as to whether the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this Section 7.6, the burden of proof shall be on Parent
and the Surviving Company to establish that an Indemnified Party is not so entitled. As used in this Section 7.6(a), (A) the term "Claim" means any threatened, asserted, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental Entity or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in
good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Party's duties or service as a director or officer of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time and any other Person at the request the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (B) the term "Expenses" means reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being

existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "D&O Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), provided that the annual premium therefor shall not exceed $1,718,760. If the Company or the
Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Company shall purchase from the Company's current insurance carrier or from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period

Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage as can be obtained for $1,718,760, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Company's and the Company's Subsidiaries' existing directors' and officers' liability

of any Indemnified Party under this Section 7.6 without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations of
the Surviving Company under this Section 7.6. Parent and the Surviving Company, jointly and severally, shall pay all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that
an Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.6.

negotiations with such Person with respect to any Alternative Proposal, effective on and from the date of this Agreement, and the notice shall also request such Person to promptly
return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.7, during the period commencing on the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit (including by way of furnishing non-public information), initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub or their respective designees) any non-public information relating to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (other than Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective designees), in any such case relating to an Alternative Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that could lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) engage in,

relating to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to, and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the personnel, of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries to, a Person or group of Persons that makes a bona fide Alternative Proposal (under circumstances in which the Company has complied with its non-
solicitation obligations under Section 7.7(a)); provided, however, that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information
concerning the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives (which requirement may be satisfied by posting such information in the online data room established by the Company prior to the date hereof); and provided further
that, prior to initiating any such action, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Alternative Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and provided further that prior to furnishing such
information or access to, or entering into substantive discussions (except as to the existence of this Section 7.7) or negotiations with, such Person(s), (A) the Company receives from
such Person(s) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) the Company notifies Parent to the effect that it intends to furnish information or access to, or intends to
enter into substantive discussions or negotiations with, such Person(s). The Company agrees that neither the Company nor any of the Company's Subsidiaries will enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.

        (c)   Except as provided by Section 7.7(d), at any time after the execution of this Agreement, the Company Board shall not:

          (i)  resolve to withdraw, modify or qualify and/or withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (a
"Company Recommendation Change");

         (ii)  approve or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

        (iii)  cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") relating to an
Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance with the terms of Section 7.7(b)) or authorize, approve or publicly recommend an
Alternative Proposal or any agreement, understanding or arrangement relating to an Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance
with the terms of Section 7.7(b)).

Vote, (i) the Company is then in receipt of a bona fide written Alternative Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (ii) if there occurs any Fiduciary Change, the Company Board may (1) effect a
Company Recommendation Change, and/or (2) in the case of a Superior Proposal, adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend, to the stockholders of the Company any such Superior Proposal and authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii) to enter into

terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) and enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal), provided that the
Company Board may effect a Company Recommendation Change, if and only if:

          (i)  the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable laws; and

         (ii)  the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii), including the payment of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 9.2(a); provided, however, that (A) prior to terminating this Agreement, the Company shall give Parent at least three (3) Business Days' notice thereof,
attaching the Alternative Proposal Agreement (or, if applicable, the most current draft thereof), which notice need only be given once with respect to any Superior Proposal,
unless such Superior Proposal is modified in any material respect in which case the three (3) Business Day period referred to herein shall be 48 hours, and (B) if, within such
three (3) Business Day period (or where applicable, 48 -hour period), Parent makes an offer to the Company that the Company Board determines in good faith is more favorable
to the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates), from a financial point of view, than such Superior Proposal (taking into
account, among other things, (I) the terms of such offer and (II) all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of such offer
which the Company Board deems relevant), and agrees in writing to all adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are necessary to reflect such offer, the
Company's notice of termination with respect to such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be rescinded and of no further force and effect and, if the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company has entered into a Superior Proposal Agreement, it shall promptly terminate such agreement (it being agreed that the Company will cause any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement entered into prior to the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period (or where applicable, 48-hour period) to include a provision
permitting such termination).

        (e)   The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the matters contemplated by this Section 7.7 (including any Alternative Proposals). Without limiting the
generality of foregoing, (i) the Company shall promptly notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Alternative Proposal are received by the Company or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any material amendments thereto), including any change in the Company's intentions as previously notified, and (ii) the Company agrees that it will promptly notify
Parent if any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company's intentions as previously notified. The Company
agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

        (f)    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law or would constitute a violation of applicable law. It is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including Section 7 and Section 9), a factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Company's receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board, shall not constitute a Company Recommendation Change or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Alternative
Proposal.

        (g)   Other than with respect to the Debt Commitment, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall make or enter into any formal or informal
arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding) with any Person, or have any discussions or other communications with any other Person, in any such case with respect to any

to restrict a Person from communicating an Alternative Proposal (or any amendment thereof) to the Company Board) or, to the extent applicable, a confidentiality agreement
entered into prior to the execution of this Agreement.

         (ii)  "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any proposal, indication or offer, including any proposal, indication or offer from or to the Company's stockholders, made by any
Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates relating to, whether in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, and whether directly or indirectly, any (i) transaction or series of transactions (including any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar direct or indirect transaction involving the Company and/or any Subsidiary
or Subsidiaries of the Company) for the issuance or acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company whose business or businesses
constitute twenty percent (20%) (in number or voting power) or more of the assets, revenues or earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) acquisition,
license or purchase of assets of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or to

Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of equity interests representing a twenty percent (20%) or greater economic or voting interest in the Company or tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning equity
interests representing a twenty percent (20%) (in number or voting power) or greater economic or voting interest in the Company (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that a

Company Common Stock in effect on the date hereof shall not be considered an Alternative Proposal).

        (iii)  "Fiduciary Change" shall mean any determination by the Company Board, prior to the Company Required Vote, that it is obligated to make a Company
Recommendation Change because such a change is advisable to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company.

        (iv)  "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide Alternative Proposal (except that references to "twenty percent (20%) or more" in the definition thereof will be deemed
to be references to "fifty percent (50%) or more") made by any Person that is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal, as
well as any modification to this Agreement that Parent and Merger Sub propose to make in accordance with Section 7.7(d)(ii)), are more favorable to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        7.8    Standstill.    Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall (a) purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock or any security of the Company that is convertible into Company Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or (b) form, join or in any way participate in a
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) in connection with any of the foregoing or (c) commence a tender offer or exchange offer.

        7.9    Section 16 Matters.    Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or will
be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

        7.10    Financing.    

        (a)   Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not, prior to the Effective Time, incur any

pursuant to Section 7.11 and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith.

        (b)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be taken all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to (x) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter and (y) arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market

        (c)   Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior
written consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (ii) impose new or additional conditions
that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(B) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or Borrower to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall not release or consent to
the termination of the obligations of the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an individual Financing Source under the
terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the Closing Date); provided, that if Parent proceeds with Alternative Financing, it shall
be subject to the same obligations with respect to the Alternative Financing as set forth in this Section 7.10 with respect to the Debt Financing and all references in this Agreement to
the Debt Financing shall be deemed to also refer to the Alternative Financing. The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.10(d) or
Section 7.10(b)(i) are referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as the "Financing Agreements." Parent shall provide to the Company copies of any commitment letter and fee letter

customary representation to the arranger of any financing that the information contained in any offering document or information memorandum relating to the Company and its
subsidiaries does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; (vii) cooperating reasonably with the Financing Sources' due diligence of the Company and its subsidiaries, to the extent customary and

        (a)   Each of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions so as to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall take any action prior to the Closing, and Parent shall not
take any action or fail to take any action (and shall prevent the Surviving Company from taking any action or failing to take any action) following the Closing, that would cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Surviving Company shall report the Merger for income tax purposes as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including the filing of the statement required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3, unless otherwise required

firms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause
not to be taken any action which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the representations included in the certificates described in this Section 7.12(b).

        7.13    Board of Directors of Parent After the Effective Time.    Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all such action as may be reasonably necessary to cause one (1) individual selected by
the Company and approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) prior to the Closing Date from among the Company Board (the "Company
Designee") to be elected to the Parent Board effective as of the Effective Time. If at any time prior to or after the Effective Time, the initial Company Designee is unwilling or unable to serve
as a member of Parent Board, then the Company Board (which shall be deemed, at all times after the Effective Time, to consist solely of those individuals who served as members of the
Company Board immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall, by written notice to Parent, name a new designee who shall be approved by the Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) and who, subject to such Parent approval, shall thereupon be the Company Designee for all purposes of this Agreement.

        7.14    Parent Consent as Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub.    Parent shall deliver to Company within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement evidence of its approval, as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

        7.15    Repayment of Debt.    At the Closing, and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (a) the Parent shall make available to the Company, or pay directly,

        10.5    Counterparts; Delivery.    This Agreement may be executed in multiple original, PDF or facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which taken
together shall be considered one and the same agreement. Each executed signature page to this Agreement and to each agreement and certificate delivered by a party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement may be delivered by any of the methods described in Section 10.3 hereof, provided that such delivery is effected in accordance with the notice information provided for in
Section 10.3 hereof. In the event that any signature to this Agreement or any agreement or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, or any amendment thereof, is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed)
with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original thereof. No party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver any such signature page or the fact that such signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

        10.6    Entire Agreement.    This Agreement (together with the exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule constitute the entire agreement and

survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any termination of this Agreement.

        10.7    Specific Performance.    The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur
in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions and that, accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief sought in accordance with this Section 10.7 on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions in accordance
with this Agreement to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

Delaware or of the United States of America, for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, or any of the agreements or transactions contemplated

any such court and (b) not to commence any action suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement other than in such court. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to assert in any such suit, action or proceeding, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court, (ii) any claim that such party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, and (iii) any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding is brought in
an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party shall be effective service

of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any
such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such party is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.8, each Company Related Party (as defined below) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Financing, all actions,
including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of
the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any agreement
entered into by the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of law of another jurisdiction. Furthermore and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.8, each Company Related Party (i) agrees that it will not bring
or support any action, including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to any agreement entered into by the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts,
(iii) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 10.3 shall be effective service of process against it for any
such action brought in any such court, (iv) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. The parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of Section 10.12 relating to waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim referenced in this Section 10.8. "Company Related Party" means the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries.

        10.9    Severability.    Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the
validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and
equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

        10.10    Publicity.    Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)

Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), FairPoint Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Falcon Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

        WHEREAS, Parent, the Company and Merger Sub are parties to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 3, 2016 (the "Agreement"), pursuant to the terms of
which, among other things, Parent would acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation;

        WHERAS, pursuant to Section 9.3 of the Agreement, the Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before the Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Agreement); and

        WHEREAS, Parent, the Company and Merger Sub desire to amend the Agreement as provided herein.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

        1.    Amendment.    Exhibit A of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended in its entirety and restated as Exhibit A attached hereto.

        2.    Ratification.    As amended by this First Amendment, the Agreement is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and as so amended by this First Amendment, the Agreement shall be
read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument. Upon the execution of this First Amendment, each reference in the First Agreement or the Agreement to "this Agreement," "hereby,"
"hereunder," "herein," "hereof" or words of like import referring to the Agreement shall mean and refer to the Agreement as amended by this First Amendment. Any and all notices, requests,

together shall be considered one and the same agreement. Each executed signature page to this First Amendment and to each agreement and certificate delivered by a party hereto pursuant to
this First Amendment may be delivered by any of the methods described in Section 10.3 of the Agreement, provided that such delivery is effected in accordance with the notice information
provided for in Section 10.3 of the Agreement. In the event that any signature to this First Amendment or any agreement or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, or any amendment thereof, is

signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original thereof. No party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver any such signature page or the fact that such signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail

Annex II 

Fairness Opinion of Evercore Group, L.L.C. 

December 3, 2016

The Board of Directors
FairPoint Communications, Inc.
521 E. Morehead Street, Suite 500
Charlotte, NC 28202

Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that FairPoint Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), with
Consolidated Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent") and Falcon Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), pursuant
to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (the "Surviving Company"), as a result of which the Surviving Company will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, among other things, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock"), other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into and become the right to receive 0.73 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the
"Parent Stock"), subject to adjustment in accordance with the Merger Agreement (such per share amount, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, the "Merger Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement and terms used herein and not defined shall
have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

        The Board of Directors of the Company has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of the Company
Common Stock, other than holders of Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares.

        In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:

i. reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company and Parent that we deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research
analysts' estimates; 

ii. reviewed certain non-public historical financial statements and other non-public historical financial and operating data relating to each of the Company and Parent prepared and
furnished to us by the management of the Company and Parent, respectively; 

iii. reviewed certain non-public projected financial and operating data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by the management of the Company; 

iv. reviewed certain non-public projected financial and operating data relating to Parent prepared and furnished to us by the management of Parent; 

v. reviewed the amount and timing of the cost savings estimated by the management of the Company and the management of Parent to result from the Merger (collectively, the
"Synergies"); 

vi. reviewed the amount, timing and use of certain tax attributes of the Company and the combined company, as estimated by the management of the Company and the
management of Parent;

vii. discussed the past and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of each of the Company and Parent with the management of the Company
(including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections); 

viii. reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of each of the Company Common Stock and the Parent Stock; 

ix. compared the financial performance of each of the Company and Parent and their respective stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded
companies that we deemed relevant; 

x. compared the financial performance of the Company and Parent and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with those of certain other transactions that we deemed
relevant; 

xi. reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the Merger on the future financial performance of the combined company based on the projected financial data relating to
each of the Company and Parent referred to above, including the projected Synergies and other strategic benefits and the amount and timing of realization thereof, anticipated
by the management of the Company and the management of Parent to be realized from the Merger; 

xii. reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated December 2, 2016 and 

xiii. performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy and completeness of all of the information
publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, and we assume no liability therefor. With respect to the projected
financial data relating to the Company and Parent referred to above (including the Synergies), we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and good faith judgments of the respective managements of the Company and Parent as to (i) the future financial performance of the companies under the assumptions
reflected therein and (ii) the Synergies, including the amount and timing of the realization of such Synergies. We express no view as to any projected financial data relating to the Company or
Parent, the Synergies or the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied, at your direction, without independent verification, upon the assessments of the management of the Company
and the management of Parent as to the Synergies, including the amount and timing of the realization of such Synergies.

        For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement
are true and correct, that the Merger will qualify as a tax free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement in all material respects and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without material waiver or
modification thereof. We have further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or materially reduce the benefits of the
Merger to the holders of the Company Common Stock. We have also assumed that the executed Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft Merger Agreement
dated December 2, 2016 reviewed by us.

        We have not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any physical inspection, independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company or Parent, nor have we
been furnished with any such inspection, valuation or appraisal, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the

Company or Parent under any state, federal or foreign laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of
the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to the holders of the
Company Common Stock, other than holders of Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the Merger to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Exchange Ratio or otherwise. We have
assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction will not vary our analysis in any material respect. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared
to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger. This letter, and
our opinion, does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the Company or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. We express no opinion herein as to the price at which shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Stock
will trade at any time. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to
legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

        We will receive a fee for our services following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. We will be entitled to receive a success fee upon the consummation of the Merger.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. Prior to this engagement, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates provided financial
advisory services to the Company and received fees for the rendering of these services including the reimbursement of expenses. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no
material relationship existed between Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates as a result of
such a relationship. We may provide financial or other services to Parent in the future and in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.

        In the ordinary course of business, Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or financial instruments of the Company, Parent
and their respective affiliates, for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

        This letter, and the opinion expressed herein, is addressed to, and is for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its evaluation of the proposed
Merger. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.

        This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred or communicated (in whole or in part) to or by any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval,
except the Company or Parent may reproduce this opinion in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and required to be mailed by
the Company or Parent to its stockholders relating to the Merger; provided, however, that all references to us or our opinion in any such document and the description or inclusion of our
opinion therein shall be subject to our prior consent with respect to form and substance, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Annex III 

Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC 

December 3, 2016

Board of Directors
Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc.
121 South 17th Street
Mattoon, IL 61938

Members of the Board:

        We understand that FairPoint Communications Inc. (the "Company"), Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. (the "Buyer") and Falcon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer ("Acquisition Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated December 3, 2016 (the "Merger Agreement"),
which provides, among other things, for the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than shares held in treasury or held
directly by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, Acquisition Sub or the Buyer (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a
debt previously contracted) or as to which dissenters' rights have been perfected, will be converted into 0.7300 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Buyer (the "Buyer Common Stock"), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in
the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the Buyer.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company and the Buyer, respectively; 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company and the Buyer, respectively; 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of the Company and the Buyer, respectively; 

4) Reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Merger, prepared by the managements of the Company and the Buyer,
respectively; 

5) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational
benefits anticipated from the Merger, with senior executives of the Company;

6) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Buyer, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational
benefits anticipated from the Merger, with senior executives of the Buyer; 

7) Reviewed the pro forma impact of the Merger on the Buyer's cash flow, consolidated capitalization and certain financial ratios; 

8) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock and the Buyer Common Stock; 

9) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the Buyer and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock and the Buyer Common Stock with that
of certain other publicly-traded companies that we deemed to be comparable with the Company and the Buyer, respectively, and their securities; 

10) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

11) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and their financial and legal advisors; 

12) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft commitment letter from certain lenders substantially in the form of the draft dated December 3, 2016 (the "Commitment Letter"),
and certain related documents; and 

13) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available
to us by the Company and the Buyer, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and
operational benefits anticipated from the Merger, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
respective managements of the Company and the Buyer of the future financial performance of the Company and the Buyer. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated
in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Merger will be
treated as a tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that the Buyer will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment
Letter, and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of
all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements
of the Company and the Buyer of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the Merger; (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of the Company and
the Buyer; (iii) their ability to retain key employees of the Company and the Buyer, respectively and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, the Company and the Buyer's existing and
future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business
transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are achievable. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have
relied upon, without independent verification, the assessments of the Buyer and the Company and their legal, tax, or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. We
express no opinion with respect

to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement, or any class of such persons, relative to
the Exchange Ratio. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company or the Buyer, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or
appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events
occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Buyer in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, all of which is contingent upon the closing
of the Merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley or one or more of its affiliates is providing to the Buyer a portion of the financing required in connection with the Merger, for which Morgan Stanley
will receive additional fees from the Buyer. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and financing services for the Buyer and have received fees in
connection with such services. In addition, Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof currently is a lender to the Company and currently acts as administrative agent with respect to the Company's
senior secured credit facilities and has received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and its
affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

        Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities
business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment
banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or
short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the
Buyer, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.

        This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the
information of the Board of Directors of the Buyer and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included
in its entirety in any filing the Buyer is required to make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Merger. This opinion does not in any manner address the
prices at which the Buyer Common Stock will trade following consummation of the Merger or at any time and Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the
shareholders of the Buyer and the Company should vote at the shareholders' meetings to be held in connection with the Merger.

        Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the
Buyer.
