MERGER AND SHARE ISSUANCE PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholder:

On June 30, 2017, OceanFirst Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (which we refer to as “OceanFirst”), Sun Bancorp, Inc., a
New Jersey corporation (which we refer to as “Sun”), and Mercury Merger Sub Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of OceanFirst (which we refer to as “Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the
“merger agreement”) that provides for the combination of OceanFirst and Sun. Under the terms of the merger agreement, (i) Merger
Sub will merge with and into Sun (which we refer to as the “first-step merger”), with Sun continuing as the surviving corporation in the
first-step merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of OceanFirst, (ii) immediately following the completion of the first-step merger,
Sun will merge with and into OceanFirst (which we refer to as the “second-step merger” and, together with the first-step merger, the
“integrated mergers”), with OceanFirst continuing as the surviving corporation in the second-step merger (we refer to the surviving
corporation following the second-step merger as the “combined company”), and (iii) immediately following the completion of the
integrated mergers, Sun National Bank, a national bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun (which we refer to as “Sun National
Bank”), will merge with and into OceanFirst Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of OceanFirst (which we refer to as “OceanFirst
Bank”), with OceanFirst Bank being the surviving bank in such merger (which we refer to as the “bank merger” and, together with the
integrated mergers, the “Transactions”).

At the effective time of the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”), each outstanding share of the common
stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Sun (which we refer to as “Sun common stock”), except for certain shares of Sun common stock
owned by Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive either:
 

 

(i) an amount in cash (which we refer to as the “cash consideration”) equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of
0.7884 multiplied by the volume-weighted average trading price of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
OceanFirst (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst common stock”) for the five trading days immediately prior to the day on
which the first-step merger occurs (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst share closing price”); or

 

 
(ii) a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the quotient of (A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the

OceanFirst share closing price (we refer to such quotient as the “exchange ratio,” we refer to such number of shares as the
“stock consideration” and we refer to the stock consideration and the cash consideration as the “merger consideration”).

Holders of Sun common stock will have the right to elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, subject to
the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash
consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time.

The market value of the stock consideration will fluctuate with the market price of OceanFirst common stock and will not be
known at the time that holders of Sun common stock (which we refer to as the “Sun shareholders”) vote on the first-step merger. Based
on the $24.88 volume weighted-average closing price of OceanFirst common stock on the NASDAQ for the five trading day period
ending on and including September 15, 2017 (which we refer to as the “assumed OceanFirst share closing price”), the latest practicable
trading day before the printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the per share value of the merger consideration was equal to
$23.32 (and the aggregate value of the merger consideration was equal to approximately $449.5 million), which includes the value of
the stock portion of the merger consideration and the cash portion of the merger consideration. Based on an assumed exchange ratio of
0.9403 (which was based on the assumed OceanFirst share closing price) and the number of shares of Sun common stock outstanding
as of September 15, 2017 (which includes the number of shares of Sun common stock underlying Sun’s restricted

stock awards and restricted stock award units as of September 15, 2017), the maximum number of OceanFirst common stock estimated
to be issuable at the effective time is 18,646,027. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for OceanFirst (trading
symbol “OCFC”) and Sun (trading symbol “SNBC”).

OceanFirst will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst special meeting”) in connection
with the issuance of the shares of OceanFirst common stock representing the stock consideration (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst
share issuance”). At the OceanFirst special meeting, the holders of OceanFirst common stock (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst
stockholders”) will be asked to vote to approve the OceanFirst share issuance. Approval of the OceanFirst share issuance requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by the OceanFirst stockholders at the OceanFirst special meeting.

Sun will hold a special meeting of its shareholders (which we refer to as the “Sun special meeting”) in connection with the first-
step merger. At the Sun special meeting, Sun shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the merger agreement and related matters,
as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Under New Jersey law and Sun’s organizational documents, approval of the
merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by Sun shareholders entitled to vote at the Sun special
meeting.

The OceanFirst special meeting will be held on October 25, 2017 at 975 Hooper Avenue, Toms River, New Jersey 08753, at 6:00
p.m. local time. The Sun special meeting will be held on October 24, 2017 at 350 Fellowship Road, Suite 101, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey
08054, at 10:00 a.m. local time.

The Sun board of directors unanimously recommends that Sun shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step merger, “FOR” the Sun merger-related
compensation proposal and “FOR” the Sun adjournment proposal.

The OceanFirst board of directors unanimously recommends that OceanFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the OceanFirst
share issuance and “FOR” the OceanFirst adjournment proposal.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the Sun special meeting, the OceanFirst special meeting, the Transactions, the
OceanFirst share issuance, the documents related to the Transactions and other related matters. Please carefully read this entire joint
proxy statement/prospectus, including “Risk Factors,” beginning on page 27, for a discussion of the risks relating to the
proposed merger and the OceanFirst share issuance. You also can obtain information about OceanFirst and Sun from documents
that each has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following are some questions that you, as an OceanFirst stockholder or a Sun shareholder, may have about the Transactions, the
OceanFirst share issuance, the OceanFirst special meeting or the Sun special meeting, as applicable, and brief answers to those
questions. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this joint proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section
does not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to the Transactions, the OceanFirst share issuance,
the OceanFirst special meeting or the Sun special meeting, as applicable. For details about where you can find additional important
information, please see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 146.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to “OceanFirst” refer to OceanFirst
Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, and references to “Sun” refer to Sun Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation, and its subsidiaries.

Q: What are the Transactions?

A: OceanFirst, Sun and Mercury Merger Sub Corp. (which we refer to as “Merger Sub”) entered into the merger agreement on June 30,
2017. The first-step merger is the first step in a series of transactions to combine OceanFirst and Sun, and their respective subsidiary
banks, OceanFirst Bank and Sun National Bank.

Under the terms of the merger agreement:
 

 
•  Merger Sub will merge with and into Sun, with Sun continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger and as a wholly-

owned subsidiary of OceanFirst (which we refer to as the “first-step merger”).
 

 

•  Immediately following the completion of the first-step merger, Sun, as the surviving corporation in the first-step merger, will
merge with and into OceanFirst (which we refer to as the “second-step merger” and, together with the first-step merger, the
“integrated mergers”), with OceanFirst being the surviving corporation (we refer to the surviving corporation following the
second-step merger as the “combined company”).

 

 
•  Immediately following the completion of the integrated mergers, Sun National Bank will merge with and into OceanFirst

Bank, with OceanFirst Bank being the surviving bank (which we refer to as the “bank merger” and, together with the
integrated mergers, the “Transactions”).

A copy of the merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

The integrated mergers cannot be completed unless, among other things:
 

 
•  The holders (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst stockholders”) of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of

OceanFirst (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst common stock”) approve the issuance of the shares of OceanFirst common
stock in connection with the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst share issuance”).

 

 
•  The holders (which we refer to as the “Sun shareholders”) of the common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Sun (which

we refer to as the “Sun common stock”) approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “Sun merger proposal”).

The completion of the integrated mergers is subject to the fulfillment of additional customary conditions, which are discussed in the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement —Conditions to Complete the Integrated Mergers”
beginning on page 104.

Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?

A: We are delivering this document to you because it is a joint proxy statement being used by both the OceanFirst board of directors
(which we refer to as the “OceanFirst board”) and the Sun board of directors (which we refer to as the “Sun board”) to solicit proxies
of the stockholders of OceanFirst and shareholders of Sun, as applicable, in connection with the approval of the OceanFirst share
issuance and the Sun merger proposal, as applicable, and related matters.

In order to approve the OceanFirst share issuance, OceanFirst has called a special meeting of the OceanFirst stockholders (which we
refer to as the “OceanFirst special meeting”). In order to approve the Sun merger proposal, Sun has called a special meeting of the Sun
shareholders (which we refer to as the “Sun special meeting”). This document also serves as a notice of the OceanFirst special meeting
and the Sun special meeting, and describes the proposals to be presented at each special meeting.

In addition, this document is also a prospectus that is being delivered to Sun shareholders because OceanFirst is offering shares of
OceanFirst common stock to Sun shareholders in connection with, and as consideration for, the first-step merger.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the Transactions. This document also contains important
information about the proposals being voted on at the OceanFirst special meeting and the Sun special meeting, respectively. You should
read this document carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares voted by proxy without attending
your special meeting. Your vote is important. We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.

Q: In addition to the OceanFirst share issuance, what else are OceanFirst stockholders being asked to vote on at the OceanFirst
special meeting?

A: In addition to voting on the OceanFirst share issuance (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst share issuance proposal”), OceanFirst
is soliciting proxies from the OceanFirst stockholders with respect to a proposal to adjourn the OceanFirst special meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the OceanFirst share issuance proposal (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst
adjournment proposal”). Completion of the integrated mergers is not conditioned upon approval of the OceanFirst adjournment
proposal.

Q: In addition to the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step
merger, what else are Sun shareholders being asked to vote on at the Sun special meeting?

A: In addition to voting on the Sun merger proposal, Sun is soliciting proxies from the Sun shareholders with respect to a proposal to
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that certain executive officers of Sun may receive in connection with
the first-step merger pursuant to agreements or arrangements with Sun (which we refer to as the “Sun merger-related compensation
proposal”) and a proposal to adjourn the Sun special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
Sun merger proposal (which we refer to as the “Sun adjournment proposal”). Completion of the integrated mergers is not conditioned
upon approval of the Sun merger-related compensation proposal or the Sun adjournment proposal.

Q: What will Sun shareholders be entitled to receive in the first-step merger?

A: If the first-step merger is completed, each outstanding share of Sun common stock, except for certain shares of Sun common stock
owned by Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive either:
 

 
(i) an amount in cash (the “cash consideration”) equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by the

volume-weighted average trading price of shares of OceanFirst common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to
the day on which the first-step merger occurs (the “OceanFirst share closing price”); or

Table of Contents

 
(ii) a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the quotient of (A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the

OceanFirst share closing price (we refer to such quotient as the “exchange ratio,” we refer to such number of shares as the
“stock consideration” and we refer to the stock consideration and the cash consideration as the “merger consideration”).

Holders of Sun common stock will have the right to elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, subject to the
allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash
consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”). Sun shareholders who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of OceanFirst common stock upon the completion of the first-step merger will instead
be entitled to receive an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) based on the OceanFirst share closing price.

Q: Will the Sun shareholders receive the form of consideration they elect?

A: A Sun shareholder may not receive the form of consideration that such Sun shareholder elects in the first-step merger. The
allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement will result, regardless of the elections made, in the total cash consideration
being equal to the product of $3.78 and the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time (we refer to such product as the “cash component”). Accordingly, upon the conversion of shares of Sun common
stock (excluding certain shares of Sun common stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst or any of their respective subsidiaries) into the right
to receive the merger consideration, the number of shares of Sun common stock to be converted into the right to receive the cash
consideration will equal the quotient of the cash component divided by the per share cash consideration (we refer to such quotient as
the “cash conversion number”), and the balance of the shares of Sun common stock that are entitled to receive the merger consideration
will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration.

Pursuant to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, if the number of shares of Sun common stock for which a
cash election has been made exceeds the cash conversion number, a pro rata portion of all those shares for which a cash election has
been made will instead be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration. Similarly, if the number of shares of Sun common
stock for which a cash election has been made is less than the cash conversion number, the outstanding shares of Sun common stock
with respect to which no election has been made will be converted to the cash consideration before any outstanding shares of Sun
common stock with respect to which a stock election has been made are converted to the cash consideration. The allocation of the
consideration payable to the Sun shareholders in the first-step merger will not be known until the results of the merger consideration
elections made by the Sun shareholders are tallied, which will not occur until near or after the closing of the Transactions. See “The
Merger Agreement — Merger Consideration” beginning on page 87.

Q: How will Sun shareholders make their elections to receive either the cash consideration or the stock consideration in the
first-step merger?

A: An election form will be mailed to each holder of record of Sun common stock as of the business day immediately preceding the
date on which the election forms are mailed. The mailing will occur at least 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline,
which is expected to be 5:00 p.m. local time (determined as the city in which the principal office of the exchange agent is located) on
the date OceanFirst and Sun agree is as near as practicable to two business days before the closing date. OceanFirst will also make an
election form available to each Sun shareholder who, following the date on which the election forms are initially mailed but prior to the
election deadline, requests such election form. Each Sun shareholder should complete and return the election form, along with Sun
stock certificate(s) (or a properly completed notice of guaranteed delivery), according to the instructions included with the form. The
election form will be provided to Sun shareholders under separate cover and is not being provided with this document.

Table of Contents

If you own shares of Sun common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to make an election,
you should seek instructions from the bank, broker or other nominee holding your shares concerning how to make an election. If you
do not send in the election form with your stock certificate(s) by the election deadline, you will be treated as though you had not made
an election.

Q: What happens if a Sun shareholder does not make a valid election to receive either the cash consideration or the stock
consideration?

A: If a Sun shareholder does not return a properly completed election form by the election deadline specified in the election form, such
Sun shareholder shares of Sun common stock will be considered “non-election” shares and will be converted into the right to receive
the stock consideration or the cash consideration according to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. In the
event one form of merger consideration (i.e., cash or shares of OceanFirst common stock) is undersubscribed, shares of Sun common
stock for which no election was validly made will be allocated to that form of merger consideration before shares of Sun common stock
electing the oversubscribed form of merger consideration will be allocated to the undersubscribed form of merger consideration
pursuant to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. Accordingly, although electing one form of merger
consideration will not guarantee you will receive that form of merger consideration for all of your shares of Sun common stock, in the
event proration is necessary, electing shares will be allocated the undersubscribed form of consideration only after such consideration is
allocated to “non-election” shares.

Q: What will OceanFirst stockholders be entitled to receive in the first-step merger?

A: OceanFirst stockholders will not be entitled to receive any merger consideration and will continue to hold the shares of OceanFirst
common stock that they held immediately prior to the completion of the first-step merger.

Q: How will the first-step merger affect Sun equity awards?

A: The Sun equity awards will be affected as follows:

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock award granted by Sun will become fully vested, and each holder of
such restricted stock awards will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive the cash
consideration or the stock consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such awards, subject to the
allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock unit award granted by Sun will be cancelled, and each holder
of such restricted stock unit awards will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive the
cash consideration or the stock consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such awards, subject to
the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

Stock Options: At the effective time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Sun common stock will be converted into an
option to purchase a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Sun common stock subject to such Sun stock option immediately prior to the effective time by
(ii) the exchange ratio; and the exercise price per share of the new option will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the per
share exercise price for each share of Sun common stock subject to such Sun option by (b) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent).

Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the time
that the first-step merger is completed?

A: Yes. Any changes in the market price of OceanFirst common stock will have a corresponding effect on the value of the stock
consideration. In addition, because the value of the per share cash consideration is derived from the OceanFirst share closing price
during a period prior to the closing, any changes in the market price of OceanFirst common stock will also have a corresponding effect
on the amount of the per share cash consideration. However, the aggregate amount of the cash consideration will not exceed the
product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time.

Q: How does the OceanFirst board recommend that I vote at the OceanFirst special meeting?

A: The OceanFirst board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the OceanFirst share issuance proposal and “FOR” the
OceanFirst adjournment proposal.

Q: How does the Sun board recommend that I vote at the Sun special meeting?

A: The Sun board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Sun merger proposal, “FOR” the Sun merger-related
compensation proposal and “FOR” the Sun adjournment proposal.

Q: When and where are the meetings?

A: The OceanFirst special meeting will be held at 975 Hooper Avenue, Toms River, New Jersey 08753 on October 25, 2017, at 6:00
p.m. local time.

The Sun special meeting will be held at 350 Fellowship Road, Suite 101, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054 on October 24, 2017, at 10:00
a.m. local time.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After you have carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and have decided how you wish to vote your shares,
please vote your shares promptly so that your shares are represented and voted at your special meeting. If you hold your shares in your
name as a stockholder of record, you must complete, sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope
as soon as possible. Alternatively, Sun shareholders may vote through the Internet or by telephone. Information and applicable
deadlines for voting Sun shares through the Internet or by telephone are set forth in the enclosed Sun proxy card instructions. If you
hold your shares in “street name” through a bank or broker, you must direct your bank or broker how to vote in accordance with the
instructions you have received from your bank or broker. “Street name” stockholders who wish to vote in person at their special
meeting will need to obtain a legal proxy from the institution that holds their shares.

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the OceanFirst special meeting?

A: The presence at the OceanFirst special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of OceanFirst common stock entitled to be voted at the OceanFirst special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at the OceanFirst special meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the OceanFirst special meeting, it is
deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the OceanFirst special meeting or for any adjournment(s) thereof.
Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be included in determining the number of shares present at the meeting for the purpose
of determining the presence of a quorum.

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the Sun special meeting?

A: The presence at the Sun special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Sun common stock entitled to be voted at the Sun special meeting will constitute a

•  Standard: Approval of the OceanFirst share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes

cast by the holders of OceanFirst common stock at the OceanFirst special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

•  Standard: The OceanFirst adjournment proposal will be approved if a majority of the votes cast by the holders of OceanFirst

common stock at the OceanFirst special meeting are voted in favor of the OceanFirst adjournment proposal.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the OceanFirst special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the OceanFirst
adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the OceanFirst adjournment proposal.

Q: What is the vote required to approve each proposal at the Sun special meeting?

A: Sun merger proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the Sun merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by Sun

shareholders entitled to vote at the Sun special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the Sun special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the Sun merger
proposal, it will have no effect on the Sun merger proposal.

OceanFirst has entered into agreements (which we refer to as the “voting and support agreements”) with (1) Bernard Brown, Sidney R.
Brown, Anne Koons, Irwin J. Brown, Jeffrey S. Brown, Shirley Brown, The Bernard A. Brown 2012 Trust, Sidney & Sandy Brown
Foundation, Inc., The Four B’s, Interactive Logistics, LLC, National Distribution Centers, L.P., National Freight, Inc. and Vineland
Construction Co. (which we refer to collectively as the “Brown family”) and (2) WLR SBI AcquisitionCo, LLC and its ultimate
controlling affiliate, WL Ross & Co., LLC (which we refer to collectively as “WLR”) (which we refer to collectively as the “Sun
supporting shareholders”), who have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things, vote the shares of Sun common
stock owned beneficially or of record by each Sun supporting shareholder in favor of the merger proposal. In addition, each Sun
supporting shareholder has agreed to vote against any proposal made in competition with the merger proposal, as well as certain other
restrictions with respect to the voting and transfer of such Sun supporting shareholder’s shares of Sun common stock.

Based on information set forth in filings with the SEC, as of September 15, 2017, made by the Sun supporting shareholders, the Sun
supporting shareholders beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 7,351,065 shares of Sun common stock (approximately 39% of the
outstanding shares of Sun common stock).

Q: Why is my vote important?

A: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for OceanFirst and/or Sun to obtain the necessary quorum to hold their respective special
meetings. If you are an OceanFirst stockholder, your failure to submit a proxy or vote in person, or failure to instruct your bank or
broker how to vote, or abstention with respect to the OceanFirst share issuance proposal will not be counted as a vote cast and will
have no effect on the approval of such proposal, even though such approval is a condition to the completion of the integrated mergers.
If you are a Sun shareholder, your failure to submit a proxy or vote in person, or failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote, or
abstention with respect to the Sun merger proposal will not be counted as a vote cast and will have no effect on the approval of such
proposal, even though such approval is a condition to the completion of the integrated mergers. The OceanFirst share issuance must be
approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total votes cast by the OceanFirst stockholders at the OceanFirst special
meeting. The Sun merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by the holders of Sun
common stock entitled to vote at the Sun special meeting. The OceanFirst board unanimously recommends that the OceanFirst
stockholders vote “FOR” the OceanFirst share issuance proposal and the Sun board unanimously recommends that the Sun
shareholders vote “FOR” the Sun merger proposal.

Q: If my shares of common stock are held in “street name” by my bank or broker, will my bank or broker automatically vote
my shares for me?

A: No. Your bank or broker cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. You should instruct your bank or broker how to
vote your shares in accordance with the instructions provided to you. Please check the voting form used by your bank or broker.

Q: If I am a participant in Sun’s 401(k) Plan, how will shares owned through such plans be voted?

A: If you hold shares of Sun common stock through the Sun National Bank 401(k) Plan (which we refer to as the “Sun 401(k) Plan”),
you will receive a voting instruction card for the Sun 401(k) Plan that reflects all shares you may vote under the Sun 401(k) Plan.
Under the terms of the Sun 401(k) Plan, a participant is entitled to vote the shares of Sun common stock held in the Sun Bancorp, Inc.
Stock Fund and credited to his or her Sun 401(k) Plan account.

Q: If I am a participant in OceanFirst’s ESOP, OceanFirst’s 401(k) Plan or Ocean Shore’s 401(k) Plan, how will shares owned
through such plans be voted?

A: If you participate in the OceanFirst Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the OceanFirst Bank Matching Contribution
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (which we collectively refer to as the “OceanFirst ESOP”), the OceanFirst Bank Retirement Plan
(which we refer to as the “OceanFirst 401(k) Plan”), or the Ocean Shore Bank Savings and Investment Plan (which we refer to as the
“Ocean Shore 401(k) Plan”), which was maintained by Ocean Shore Holding Co. (which we refer to as “Ocean Shore”) prior to
November 30, 2016, the date on which OceanFirst completed its acquisition of Ocean Shore (which we refer to as the “Ocean Shore
acquisition”), you will receive a voting instruction form for each plan that reflects all shares that you may vote under the particular
plan. Under the terms of the OceanFirst ESOP, the OceanFirst ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the OceanFirst ESOP, but each
OceanFirst ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of OceanFirst common stock allocated to his or her account.
The OceanFirst ESOP trustee, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, will vote all unallocated shares of OceanFirst
common stock held by the OceanFirst ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion
as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions.

Under the terms of the OceanFirst 401(k) Plan and the Ocean Shore 401(k) Plan, respectively, a participant is entitled to provide
instructions for all shares credited to his or her OceanFirst 401(k) Plan account or Ocean Shore 401(k) Plan account, as applicable. The
trustee will vote all shares for which no directions are given or for which timely instructions were not received in the same proportion
as shares for which voting instructions were timely received.

The deadline for returning your voting instructions is October 18, 2017.

Q: Can I attend the OceanFirst special meeting and/or the Sun special meeting and vote my shares in person?

A: Yes. All stockholders of OceanFirst and shareholders of Sun, including stockholders and shareholders of record and stockholders
and shareholders who hold their shares “in street name” through banks, brokers, nominees or any other holder of record, are invited to
attend their respective meetings. Holders of record of OceanFirst common stock and Sun common stock can vote in person at the
OceanFirst special meeting and Sun special meeting, respectively. If you are not a stockholder or shareholder of record, you must
obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, to be able to
vote in person at your meeting. If you plan to attend your special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter
from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification
with you in order to be admitted. OceanFirst and Sun reserve the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share
ownership or without proper photo identification. The use of cameras, sound recording equipment, communications devices or any
similar equipment during the special meetings is prohibited without OceanFirst’s or Sun’s express written consent, respectively.

Q: Can I change my vote?

A: OceanFirst stockholders: Yes. If you are a holder of record of OceanFirst common stock, you may change your vote or revoke any
proxy at any time before it is voted by (i) signing and returning a proxy card with a later date, (ii) delivering a written revocation letter
to OceanFirst’s corporate secretary or (iii) attending the OceanFirst special meeting in person, notifying the corporate secretary and
voting by ballot at the OceanFirst special meeting. Attendance at the OceanFirst special meeting will not automatically revoke your
proxy. A revocation or later-dated proxy received by OceanFirst after the vote will not affect the vote. OceanFirst’s corporate
secretary’s mailing address is: Corporate Secretary, OceanFirst Financial Corp., 975 Hooper Avenue, Toms River, New Jersey 08753.

Sun shareholders: Yes. If you are a holder of record of Sun common stock, you may change your vote or revoke any proxy at any time
before it is voted by (i) signing and returning a proxy with a later date (including a proxy given over the Internet or by telephone), (ii)
delivering a written revocation letter to Sun’s corporate secretary or (iii) attending the Sun special meeting in person, notifying the
corporate secretary and voting by ballot at the Sun special meeting. Attendance at the Sun special meeting by itself will not
automatically revoke your proxy. A revocation or later-dated proxy received by Sun after the vote will not affect the vote. Sun’s
corporate secretary’s mailing address is: Corporate Secretary, Sun Bancorp, Inc., 350 Fellowship Road, Suite 101, Mount Laurel, New
Jersey 08054.

If you hold your shares of OceanFirst common stock or Sun common stock in “street name” through a bank or broker, you should
contact your bank or broker to change your vote or revoke your proxy.

Q: Will OceanFirst be required to submit the OceanFirst share issuance proposal to its stockholders even if the OceanFirst
board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation?

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the OceanFirst special meeting, OceanFirst is required to submit the
OceanFirst share issuance proposal to its stockholders even if the OceanFirst board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its
recommendation.

Q: Will Sun be required to submit the Sun merger proposal to its shareholders even if the Sun board has withdrawn, modified
or qualified its recommendation?

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the Sun special meeting, Sun is required to submit the Sun merger proposal
to its shareholders even if the Sun board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation.

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated mergers to Sun shareholders?

A: The obligations of Sun and OceanFirst to complete the integrated mergers are subject to, among other customary closing conditions
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt by each of Sun and OceanFirst of the opinion of its counsel to the effect
that the integrated mergers together will be treated as an integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”).

Assuming that the integrated mergers qualify as a reorganization, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated mergers to
each Sun shareholder will vary depending on whether such Sun shareholder receives cash, shares of OceanFirst common stock or a
combination thereof in exchange for such Sun shareholder’s shares of Sun common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement.

You should read the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Integrated
Mergers” beginning on page 111 for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated
mergers. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you will depend on your particular tax
situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you.

Q: Are Sun shareholders entitled to dissenters’ rights?

A: No. Sun shareholders are not entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights in connection with the Transactions. For further information, see
“The Transactions — No Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 85.

Q: If I am a Sun shareholder, should I send in my Sun stock certificates now?

A: No. Please do not send in your Sun stock certificates with your proxy. Promptly following the completion of the first-step merger,
an exchange agent will send you instructions for exchanging Sun stock certificates for the merger consideration. See “The Merger
Agreement — Election Procedures; Exchange of Shares” beginning on page 89.

Q: What should I do if I hold my shares of Sun common stock in book-entry form?

A: You are not required to take any special additional actions if your shares of Sun common stock are held in book-entry form.
Promptly following the completion of the first-step merger, shares of Sun common stock held in book-entry form automatically will be
exchanged for shares of OceanFirst common stock in book-entry form and cash to be paid in exchange for fractional shares, if any.

Q: Whom may I contact if I cannot locate my Sun stock certificate(s)?

A: If you are unable to locate your original Sun stock certificate(s), you should contact ComputerShare, Sun’s transfer agent, at (800)
568-3476.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?

A: OceanFirst stockholders and Sun shareholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold shares of OceanFirst
common stock and/or Sun common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for
each brokerage account in which you hold such shares. If you are a holder of record of OceanFirst common stock and/or Sun common
stock and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. In addition, if you are a holder
of both OceanFirst common stock and Sun common stock, you will receive one or more separate proxy cards or voting instruction

otherwise follow the voting instructions set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ensure that you vote every share of

Q: When do you expect to complete the Transactions?

A: OceanFirst and Sun currently expect to complete the Transactions early in the first quarter of 2018. However, neither OceanFirst nor
Sun can assure you of when, or if, the Transactions will be completed. The completion of the integrated mergers is subject to the
fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including the approval by the OceanFirst stockholders of the OceanFirst share issuance
proposal, the approval by the Sun shareholders of the Sun merger proposal and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.

Q: What happens if the first-step merger is not completed?

A: If the first-step merger is not completed, Sun shareholders will not receive any consideration for their shares in connection with the
first-step merger. Instead, Sun will remain an independent public company and its common stock will continue to be listed and traded
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (which we refer to as the “NASDAQ”). In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated in
certain circumstances, a termination fee may be required to be paid by either OceanFirst or Sun. For a more detailed discussion of the
circumstances under which such payments will be required to be paid, please see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee” beginning on page 106.

SUMMARY

This summary highlights selected information from this joint proxy statement/prospectus. It may not contain all of the information
that is important to you. We urge you to read carefully the entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes, and the
other documents to which we refer in order to fully understand the Transactions. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 146. Each item in this summary refers to the page of this joint proxy statement/prospectus on which that subject
is discussed in more detail.

In the First-Step Merger, Sun Shareholders will be Entitled to Receive the Merger Consideration (page 87)

OceanFirst and Sun are proposing a strategic merger. If the first-step merger is completed, each outstanding share of Sun common
stock, except for certain shares of Sun common stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive
either (i) an amount in cash (which we refer to as the “cash consideration”) equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of
0.7884 multiplied by the volume-weighted average trading price of shares of OceanFirst common stock for the five trading days
immediately prior to the day on which the first-step merger occurs (which we refer to as the “OceanFirst share closing price”), or
(ii) a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the quotient of (A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the
OceanFirst share closing price (we refer to such quotient as the “exchange ratio,” we refer to such number of shares as the “stock
consideration” and we refer to the stock consideration and the cash consideration as the “merger consideration”). Holders of Sun
common stock will have the right to elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, subject to the allocation and
proration provisions of the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash consideration
will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time.

OceanFirst will not issue any fractional shares of OceanFirst common stock in the first-step merger. Sun shareholders who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of OceanFirst common stock upon the completion of the first-step merger will
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed as a decimal form) of OceanFirst common stock to which the holder would
otherwise be entitled by the OceanFirst share closing price.

OceanFirst common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “OCFC” and Sun common stock is listed on the NASDAQ
under the symbol “SNBC.” The following table shows the closing sale prices of OceanFirst common stock and Sun common stock
as reported on the NASDAQ on June 29, 2017, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the Transactions, and
on September 15, 2017 the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This table
also shows the implied value of the merger consideration payable for each share of Sun common stock, which was calculated by
first multiplying the closing price of OceanFirst common stock on those dates by 0.7884, and then adding $3.78.

September 15, 2017   $ 24.81   $ 22.95   $ 23.34 

The merger agreement governs the integrated mergers. The merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex A. All descriptions in this summary and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus of the terms and conditions of
the integrated mergers are qualified by reference to the merger agreement. Please read the merger agreement carefully for a more
complete understanding of the integrated mergers.

The Sun board has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the first-step merger, are advisable and in the best interests of Sun and its shareholders and has unanimously approved the merger
agreement. The Sun board unanimously recommends that Sun shareholders vote “FOR” the Sun merger proposal, “FOR” the Sun

Opinion of Sun’s Financial Advisor (page 54 and Annex D)

On June 29, 2017, Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (which we refer to as “Sandler O’Neill”) rendered its oral opinion, which was
later confirmed in writing, to the Sun board that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitation set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration
in the first-step merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Sun shareholders. The full text of the Sandler O’Neill written
opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken
in connection with the opinion, is attached to this document as Annex D. Sun shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its
entirety. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion and was necessarily based on financial, economic,
market and other conditions as they existed on, and the information made available to Sandler O’Neill as of, the date of Sandler
O’Neill’s opinion. The Sandler O’Neill written opinion is addressed to the Sun board, is directed only to the fairness of the merger
consideration to Sun shareholders from a financial point of view, and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any Sun
shareholder should vote with respect to the Sun merger proposal, the Sun merger-related compensation proposal, or any other
proposals presented at the Sun special meeting.

vote in connection with the integrated mergers.

What Holders of Sun Equity-Based Awards will be Entitled to Receive (page 91)

The Sun equity awards will be affected as follows:

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock award granted by Sun will become fully vested, and each
holder of such restricted stock awards will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive
the cash consideration or the stock consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such awards,
subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

Approval of the OceanFirst share issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by the OceanFirst
stockholders at the OceanFirst special meeting. If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in
person at the OceanFirst special meeting or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the OceanFirst share
issuance proposal, it will have no effect on the OceanFirst share issuance proposal.

at the OceanFirst special meeting are voted in favor of such proposal. If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a
proxy or fail to vote in person at the OceanFirst special meeting or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to
the OceanFirst adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the OceanFirst adjournment proposal.

Sun merger-related compensation proposal and the Sun adjournment proposal.

Only holders of record of Sun common stock at the close of business on September 15, 2017 (which we refer to as the “Sun record

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Integrated Mergers (page 111)

The obligations of Sun and OceanFirst to complete the integrated mergers are subject to, among other customary closing
conditions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt by each of Sun and OceanFirst of the opinion of its
counsel to the effect that the integrated mergers together will be treated as an integrated transaction that qualifies as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Assuming that the integrated mergers qualify as a reorganization, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated
mergers to each Sun shareholder will vary depending on whether such Sun shareholder receives cash, shares of OceanFirst
common stock or a combination thereof in exchange for such Sun shareholder’s shares of Sun common stock pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement.

You should read the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Integrated Mergers” beginning on page 111 for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
integrated mergers. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you will depend on your
particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you.

Sun’s Directors and Officers Have Financial Interests in the Transactions that Differ from Your Interests (page 80)

In considering the recommendation of the Sun board, Sun shareholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of
Sun have certain interests in the Transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Sun shareholders
generally. The Sun board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation
that Sun shareholders vote to approve the Sun merger proposal.

These interests include:
 

 
•  Each outstanding stock option to purchase Sun common stock would convert at the effective time into an option to

purchase a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock;
 

 
•  Each outstanding Sun restricted stock award or restricted stock unit would vest at the effective time and would convert

into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock subject thereto;
 

 
•  Sun and each of its executive officers is party to a change in control continuity agreement that provides for certain

payments or benefits in connection with the closing of the integrated mergers or a qualifying termination of employment
thereafter;

 

 
•  Two current members of the Sun board would be appointed to the boards of directors of OceanFirst and OceanFirst bank

at the effective time; and
 

 
•  Sun’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger

agreement.

For a more complete description of these interests, see “— Interests of Sun’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions.”

Sun Shareholders Are NOT Entitled to Assert Dissenters’ Rights (page 85)

Under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (which we refer to as the “NJBCA”), the holders of Sun common stock will not
have any dissenters’ rights with respect to the Transactions. For further information, see “The Transactions — No Dissenters’
Rights” beginning on page 85.

Completion of the Transactions; Conditions That Must Be Fulfilled For The Integrated Mergers To Occur (page 104)

Currently, Sun and OceanFirst expect to complete the Transactions early in the first quarter of 2018. As more fully described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, the completion of the integrated mergers depends on a number
of customary closing conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived. These conditions include, among others:
 

 
•  approval of the merger agreement by the Sun shareholders and approval of the issuance of shares of OceanFirst common

stock in connection with the first-step merger by the OceanFirst stockholders;
 

 •  authorization for listing on the NASDAQ of the shares of OceanFirst common stock to be issued in the first-step merger;
 

 

•  the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (which we refer to as the “Federal Reserve Board”) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (which we
refer to as the “OCC”), without any such requisite regulatory approval including or containing, or resulting in the
imposition of, a materially burdensome regulatory condition (as defined below);

 

 •  effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, injunction or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the integrated mergers or

making the completion of the integrated mergers illegal;
 

 
•  subject to the materiality standards provided in the merger agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties

of OceanFirst and Sun in the merger agreement;
 

 •  performance in all material respects by each of OceanFirst and Sun of its obligations under the merger agreement; and
 

 •  receipt by each of OceanFirst and Sun of an opinion from its counsel as to certain tax matters.

Neither Sun nor OceanFirst can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the integrated mergers will be satisfied or waived, or that
the integrated mergers will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 105)

The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to the effective time in the following circumstances:
 

 •  by mutual written consent, if the OceanFirst board and the Sun board so determine;
 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board or the Sun board if (i) any governmental entity denies any requisite regulatory approval in
connection with the Transactions and such denial has become final and nonappealable, or (ii) any governmental entity of
competent jurisdiction has issued a final and nonappealable order permanently prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, unless the failure to obtain a requisite
regulatory approval is due to the failure of the terminating party to perform or observe its obligations under the merger
agreement;

 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board or the Sun board if the integrated mergers have not been consummated on or before the
one-year anniversary of the date of the merger agreement (which we refer to as the “termination date”), unless the failure
of the integrated mergers to be consummated by such date is due to the failure of the terminating party to perform or
observe its obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 
•  by the OceanFirst board or the Sun board (except that the terminating party cannot then be in material breach of any

representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger

agreement) if the other party breaches any of its obligations or any of its representations and warranties (or any such
representation or warranty ceases to be true) set forth in the merger agreement which either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the closing date, the
failure of a closing condition of the terminating party and such breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or such breach cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer
days as remain prior to the termination date);

 

 

•  by the Sun board, prior to the time that the OceanFirst share issuance proposal is approved, if the OceanFirst board
(i) fails to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the OceanFirst stockholders approve the OceanFirst
share issuance, or takes certain adverse actions with respect to such recommendation, or (ii) materially breaches certain
obligations with respect to calling a meeting of its stockholders and recommending that they approve the OceanFirst
share issuance; or

 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board, prior to the time that the Sun merger proposal is approved, if the Sun board (i) fails to
recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the Sun shareholders approve the merger agreement, or takes
certain adverse actions with respect to such recommendation, (ii) fails to recommend against acceptance of any publicly-
disclosed tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Sun common stock (other than by OceanFirst or an affiliate of
OceanFirst) within ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”), (iii) recommends or endorses an acquisition proposal, or
(iv) materially breaches certain obligations with respect to acquisition proposals or calling a meeting of its shareholders
and recommending that they approve the merger agreement.

Termination Fee (page 106)

If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving alternative acquisition
proposals with respect to Sun, changes in the recommendation of the Sun board or changes in the recommendation of the
OceanFirst board, Sun or OceanFirst, as applicable, may be required to pay to the other party a termination fee equal to
$17.045 million (which we refer to as the “termination fee”). The termination fee could discourage other companies from seeking
to acquire or merge with Sun or OceanFirst.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger (page 85)

Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, both Sun and OceanFirst have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals or waivers necessary or advisable to complete the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. These include approvals from, among others, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC.
OceanFirst submitted applications to the Federal Reserve Board (which we refer to as the “FRB application”) and the OCC (which
we refer to as the “OCC application”) on September 1, 2017. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, each of the
FRB application and the OCC application remain outstanding. Although OceanFirst knows of no reason why the FRB application
or the OCC application should not be approved in a timely manner, OceanFirst cannot be certain when, or if, the FRB application
and the OCC application will be approved. In addition, subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, prior to
the completion of the Transactions, OceanFirst Bank intends to convert from a federal savings association into a national banking
association, and OceanFirst intends to cease being a savings and loan holding company and become a bank holding company.

The Rights of Sun Shareholders Will Change as a Result of the First-Step Merger (page 127)

OceanFirst is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and Sun is incorporated under the laws of the State of New
Jersey. Accordingly, Delaware law governs the OceanFirst stockholders and New Jersey law

governs the Sun shareholders. As a result of the first-step merger, Sun shareholders who receive the stock consideration (either
because they elect to receive stock consideration or because of the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement)
will become OceanFirst stockholders. Thus, following the completion of the first-step merger, the rights of Sun shareholders who
so become OceanFirst stockholders in the first-step merger will be governed by the corporate law of the State of Delaware and will
also then be governed by OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, rather than by the corporate law of the State of New
Jersey and Sun’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

See “Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights” for a description of the material differences in stockholders’ rights under the laws of
the State of Delaware, the laws of the State of New Jersey and each of the OceanFirst and Sun governing documents.

Information About the Companies (pages 46, 47 and 48)

Litigation Related to the Transactions (page 86)

On July 18, 2017, three purported Sun shareholders filed putative shareholder class action lawsuits against Sun, the members of
the Sun board, OceanFirst and Merger Sub in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Burlington County, Chancery Division, captioned
Bruce Oswald v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000070 17; Robert Rumsey v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C
000071 17; and Paul D. Chetcuti v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000072 17. The actions generally allege that members
of the Sun board breached their fiduciary duties by approving the merger agreement because the transaction is procedurally flawed
and financially inadequate. Plaintiffs further allege that OceanFirst and Merger Sub aided and abetted such alleged breaches. The
actions seek to enjoin the Transactions, as well as unspecified money damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and expense. On July 31,
2017, the plaintiffs in such class action lawsuits filed a motion to consolidate all three actions, and for the appointment of interim
lead counsel. On August 28, 2017, the court granted the motion to consolidate, consolidating all three actions under the caption In
re Sun Bancorp, Inc. Consolidated Stockholder Litigation, Docket No. C-70-17 (which we refer to as the “Consolidated Action”).
Plaintiffs’ motion for the appointment of interim lead counsel was denied without prejudice. On August 28, 2017, the
Consolidated Action was transferred to the Honorable John E. Harrington, P.J. Civ. as Burlington County’s designated Complex
Business Litigation Judge. On September 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint in the Consolidated
Action, which also alleges that the Sun board breached their fiduciary duties in failing to disclose material information about the
transaction. Also on September 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery and a supporting memorandum of law.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

The following table shows selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial condition and results of operations data for
OceanFirst giving effect to the Transactions and, with respect to the pro forma data about the results of operations data for
OceanFirst for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, the Cape acquisition and the Ocean Shore acquisition (collectively,
the “OceanFirst business combinations”).

With respect to the Transactions, the selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information assumes that the
Transactions will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with OceanFirst treated as the acquirer. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets and identifiable liabilities of Sun, as of the effective date of the
Transactions, will be recorded by OceanFirst at their respective estimated fair values and the excess of the merger consideration
over the estimated fair value of Sun’s net identifiable assets will be allocated to goodwill.

The pro forma financial condition data set forth in the table below assumes that the Transactions became effective on June 30,
2017. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for the period ending June 30, 2017
presents the pro forma results of operations of OceanFirst giving effect to the Transactions assuming that the Transactions became
effective at the beginning of such period. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for the
period ending December 31, 2016 presents the pro forma results of operations of OceanFirst giving effect to each of the
OceanFirst business combinations assuming that each OceanFirst business combination became effective on January 1, 2016.

The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data has been derived from and should be read in conjunction
with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the notes thereto, which is included in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus under the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.”
The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of
the periods presented. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data also does not consider any potential
impacts of current market conditions on revenues, potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and expense
efficiencies, or asset dispositions, among other factors. Further, as explained in more detail in the notes accompanying the more
detailed unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 118, the pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the selected
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase
price allocation that will be recorded at the time the Transactions are completed. Additionally, the adjustments made in the
unaudited pro forma condensed financial information, which are described in those notes, are preliminary and may be revised.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

Presented below for OceanFirst and Sun is historical, unaudited pro forma combined and pro forma equivalent per share financial
data. The information presented below should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements of OceanFirst
and Sun, including the related notes, filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
See “Where You Can Find More Information.” The unaudited pro forma combined and pro forma equivalent per share information
gives effect to the Transactions as if they had been effective on June 30, 2017 in the case of the book value data, and as if the
Transactions had been effective as of the beginning of the periods presented in the case of the earnings per share and the cash
dividends data. The unaudited pro forma earnings per share data and dividend data combines the historical results of Sun into
OceanFirst’s consolidated statement of income. While certain adjustments to the book value data were made for the estimated
impact of fair value adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not indicative of what could have occurred had the
acquisition taken place as of the beginning of the period presented. In addition, the unaudited pro forma data includes adjustments
that are preliminary and may be revised. The unaudited pro forma data, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of
the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the impact of factors that may result as a consequence of the
Transactions or consider any potential impacts of current market conditions or the Transactions on revenues, expense efficiencies,
asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors, nor the impact of possible business model changes. As a result,
unaudited pro forma data is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not represent an attempt to predict or suggest future
results.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the section “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 34 you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding how to vote for the proposals
presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 146.

Because the market price of OceanFirst common stock may fluctuate, Sun shareholders cannot be certain of the market value of
the stock portion of the merger consideration they will receive.

At the time the first-step merger is completed, each issued and outstanding share of Sun common stock, except for certain shares of
Sun common stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive either (i) the cash consideration, which is an
amount in cash equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by the OceanFirst share closing price, or (ii) the
stock consideration, which will be a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the exchange ratio, which is the quotient
of (A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the OceanFirst share closing price. Holders of Sun common stock will have the right to
elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger
agreement. The merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78
and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. There will be a
lapse of time between each of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the OceanFirst special meeting, the date of
the Sun special meeting, the election deadline by which Sun shareholders may elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock
consideration, the date on which the first-step merger is completed and the date on which Sun shareholders entitled to receive the
merger consideration actually receive the merger consideration. The market value of OceanFirst common stock may fluctuate during
these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in OceanFirst’s businesses,
operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of the control of OceanFirst and Sun.

Because the merger consideration is primarily based on the OceanFirst share closing price, any changes in the market price of
OceanFirst common stock prior to the completion of the first-step merger will have a corresponding effect on the amount of per share
cash consideration and the value of the per share stock consideration. There will be no adjustments to the formula to be used for
calculating the per share cash consideration or the per share stock consideration as a result of any changes in the market prices of either
OceanFirst common stock or Sun common stock.

In addition, because the date when the proposed Transactions will be completed will be later than the date of the OceanFirst special
meeting and the Sun special meeting, neither OceanFirst stockholders nor Sun shareholders will know at the time they vote in the
applicable special meeting the exact value of the OceanFirst common stock that will determine the merger consideration. Accordingly,
if the OceanFirst share closing price is lower than the market price of OceanFirst common stock on the date of the Sun special meeting,
the merger consideration will be lower than what the merger consideration would have been at the time the Sun shareholders vote on
the Sun merger agreement proposal.

The market price of OceanFirst common stock after the first-step merger is completed may be affected by factors different from
those affecting the market price of Sun or OceanFirst common stock currently.

Upon completion of the first-step merger, Sun shareholders who receive the stock consideration (either because they elect to receive
stock consideration or because of the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement) will become OceanFirst
stockholders. OceanFirst’s business differs in important respects from that of

Sun, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of OceanFirst common stock after the
completion of the first-step merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of
operations of each of OceanFirst and Sun. For a discussion of the businesses of OceanFirst and Sun and of some important factors to
consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 146.

Sun shareholders may receive a form of merger consideration different from what they elect.

Although each Sun shareholder may elect to receive either the cash consideration or the stock consideration in the first-step merger, the
merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the total
number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Accordingly, depending on the
elections made by other Sun shareholders, a Sun shareholder might receive a portion of the merger consideration in the form such
holder did not elect. See “The Merger Agreement — Merger Consideration.”

If a Sun shareholder does not submit a properly completed and signed form of election to the exchange agent by the election deadline,
then such holder will have no control over the type of merger consideration such holder may receive. In the event one form of merger
consideration (i.e., cash or shares of OceanFirst common stock) is undersubscribed, shares of Sun common stock for which no election
was validly made will be allocated to that form of merger consideration before shares of Sun common stock electing the
oversubscribed form of merger consideration will be allocated to the undersubscribed form of merger consideration pursuant to the
allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. Accordingly, although electing one form of merger consideration will not
guarantee you will receive that form of merger consideration for all of your shares of Sun common stock, in the event proration is
necessary, electing shares will be allocated the undersubscribed form of consideration only after such consideration is allocated to
“non-election” shares.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently
anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Transactions.

Before the Transactions can be completed, OceanFirst must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC. Other
approvals, as well as waivers or consents, from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals,
waivers and consents the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party and the factors
described under the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — Regulatory Approvals Required for
the Transactions” beginning on page 85. In addition, subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, prior to the
completion of the Transactions, OceanFirst Bank intends to convert from a federal savings association into a national banking
association, and OceanFirst intends to cease being a savings and loan holding company and become a bank holding company. An
adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or these factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their
receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Transactions or require changes to the terms of the
Transactions. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Transactions or imposing
additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions, any of which
might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the completion of the Transactions. However, under the terms of the
merger agreement, in connection with obtaining such regulatory approvals or waivers, neither party is required to take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
(measured on a scale relative to Sun) on any of OceanFirst, Sun or the combined company, after giving effect to the integrated mergers
(which we refer to as a “materially burdensome regulatory condition”). For more information, see the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transactions” beginning on page 85.

Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost
savings of the Transactions may not be realized.

OceanFirst and Sun have operated and, until the completion of the Transactions, will continue to operate, independently. The success of
the Transactions, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on OceanFirst’s ability to successfully combine
and integrate the businesses of OceanFirst and Sun in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt
existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could
result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls,
procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,
depositors, employees and other constituents or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Transactions. The loss of key
employees could adversely affect OceanFirst’s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on
OceanFirst’s financial results and the value of its common stock. If OceanFirst experiences difficulties with the integration process, the
anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any
merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause OceanFirst and/or Sun to lose customers or cause
customers to remove their accounts from OceanFirst and/or Sun and move their business to competing financial institutions.
Integration efforts between the two companies, as well as OceanFirst’s ongoing integration efforts relating to the Cape acquisition and
the Ocean Shore acquisition, will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse
effect on each of Sun and OceanFirst during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Transaction
on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Transactions could be less than anticipated.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document are preliminary. The actual financial
condition and results of operations of OceanFirst after the completion of the Transactions may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what OceanFirst’s actual financial condition or results of operations
would have been had the Transactions been completed on the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statements
for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the six month period ended June 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of what
OceanFirst’s actual results of operations would have been had the Transactions (and, in the case of the pro forma income statement for
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Cape acquisition and the Ocean Shore acquisition) been completed as of January 1, 2016 and
January 1, 2017, respectively. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments to illustrate the
effect of the Transactions (and, in the case of the pro forma income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016, the effect of the
Cape acquisition and the Ocean Shore acquisition) had they been completed on the dates indicated. Such unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the Sun identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized.

The purchase price allocation for the first-step merger reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and final
allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable assets and identifiable
liabilities of Sun as of the date of the completion of the Transactions. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may
differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning
on page 118.

Table of Contents

Certain of Sun’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Transactions that may differ from the interests of the Sun
shareholders.

The directors and executive officers of Sun have certain interests in the Transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Sun shareholders generally. The Sun board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
making its recommendation that Sun shareholders vote to approve the Sun merger proposal.

These interests include:
 

 
•  Each outstanding stock option to purchase Sun common stock would convert at the effective time into an option to purchase

a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock;
 

 
•  Each outstanding Sun restricted stock award or restricted stock unit would vest at the effective time and would convert into

the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock subject thereto;
 

 
•  Sun and each of its executive officers is party to a change in control continuity agreement that provides for certain payments

or benefits in connection with the closing of the integrated mergers or a qualifying termination of employment thereafter;
 

 
•  Two current members of the Sun board would be appointed to the boards of directors of OceanFirst and OceanFirst Bank at

the effective time; and
 

 
•  Sun’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger

agreement.

For a more complete description of these interests, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Transactions — Interests of Sun’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” beginning on page 80.

The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and the Transactions may not be completed.

The merger agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the
Transactions, including the receipt of the requisite approval of the OceanFirst stockholders, the requisite approval of the Sun
shareholders and the requisite regulatory approvals. These conditions to the closing of the Transactions may not be fulfilled in a timely
manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Transactions may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, OceanFirst and Sun may
elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances and, in certain limited circumstances, Sun or OceanFirst may be
required to pay to the other party a termination fee of $17.045 million.

If the Transactions are not completed, OceanFirst and Sun will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected
benefits of the Transactions, and may experience other adverse consequences to their future business and financial results.

Each of OceanFirst and Sun has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the
Transactions, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and
other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the first-step merger. If the Transactions are not completed, OceanFirst and Sun would
have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Transactions

In addition, if the Transactions are not completed, the ongoing businesses of Sun and OceanFirst may be adversely affected, and Sun
and OceanFirst will be subject to several risks, including:
 

 
•  Sun or OceanFirst may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay to the other party a termination fee of

$17.045 million;

Table of Contents

 
•  Under the merger agreement, Sun and OceanFirst are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective

businesses prior to completing the Transactions, which may adversely affect the ability of each of Sun and OceanFirst to
execute certain of its business strategies; and

 

 
•  Matters relating to the Transactions may require substantial commitments of time and resources by the management teams of

Sun and OceanFirst, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Sun
and OceanFirst, respectively.

Finally, if the Transactions are not completed, Sun and OceanFirst may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and
from their customers and employees. For example, Sun’s or OceanFirst’s businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure
to pursue other opportunities due to management’s focus on the Transactions, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of
completing the Transactions. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of the Sun common stock or the
OceanFirst common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Transactions
will be completed. If the Transactions are not completed, neither Sun nor OceanFirst can assure its shareholders that the risks described
above will not materialize and will not materially affect its business, financial results or stock price.

Sun and OceanFirst will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Transactions are pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Sun or OceanFirst. These
uncertainties may impair Sun’s or OceanFirst’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transactions are
completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Sun or OceanFirst to seek to change existing business relationships
with Sun or OceanFirst. Retention of certain employees by Sun or OceanFirst may be challenging while the Transactions are pending,
as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with OceanFirst. If key employees depart because of issues
relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Sun or OceanFirst, Sun’s business or OceanFirst’s
business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Sun has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior
to closing, and each of Sun and OceanFirst has agreed to certain restrictive covenants. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement —Covenants and Agreements” beginning on page 95 for a description of the
restrictive covenants applicable to Sun and OceanFirst.

Litigation relating to the Transactions could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as
delay and/or enjoin the Transactions.

On July 18, 2017, three purported Sun shareholders filed putative shareholder class actions against Sun, the members of the Sun board,
OceanFirst and Merger Sub in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Burlington County, Chancery Division, captioned Bruce Oswald v.
Sun Bancorp, Inc, et al., Docket No. C 000070 17; Robert Rumsey v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000071 17; and Paul D.
Chetcuti v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000072 17. The actions generally allege that members of the Sun board breached
their fiduciary duties by approving the merger agreement because the transaction is procedurally flawed and financially inadequate.
Plaintiffs further allege that OceanFirst and Merger Sub aided and abetted such alleged breaches. The actions seek to enjoin the
Transactions, as well as unspecified money damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and expense. On July 31, 2017, the plaintiffs in such
class action lawsuits filed a motion to consolidate all three actions, and for the appointment of interim lead counsel. On August 28,
2017, the court granted the motion to consolidate, consolidating all three actions under the caption In re Sun Bancorp, Inc.
Consolidated Stockholder Litigation, Docket No. C-70-17. Plaintiffs’ motion for the appointment of interim lead counsel was denied
without prejudice. On August 28, 2017, the Consolidated Action was transferred to the Honorable John E. Harrington, P.J. Civ. as
Burlington County’s designated Complex Business Litigation Judge. On September 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action
Complaint in the Consolidated Action, which also alleges that the Sun board breached their fiduciary duties in failing to disclose
material information about the transaction. Also on September 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery and a
supporting memorandum of law.

The merger agreement limits Sun’s ability to pursue acquisition proposals and requires either company to pay a termination fee of
$17.045 million under limited circumstances, including circumstances relating to acquisition proposals for Sun. Additionally,
certain provisions of Sun’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter potential acquirers.

The merger agreement prohibits Sun from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating certain third-party
acquisition proposals. For more information, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers” beginning on page 103. In addition, unless the merger agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, Sun has an unqualified obligation to submit the Sun merger proposal to a vote by Sun
shareholders, even if Sun receives a proposal that the Sun board believes is superior to the Transactions. For more information, see the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement — Stockholder Meetings and Recommendation of the
Boards of Directors of Sun and OceanFirst” beginning on page 101. The merger agreement also provides that OceanFirst or Sun must
pay a termination fee in the amount of $17.045 million in the event that the merger agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances, including Sun’s failure to abide by certain obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals. See the section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee” beginning on page 106. These provisions might
discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Sun from considering or
proposing such an acquisition.

OceanFirst has entered into voting and support agreements with the Brown family and separate voting and support agreements with
WLR, in each case, who have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things, vote the shares of Sun common stock
owned beneficially or of record by each Sun supporting shareholder in favor of the Sun merger proposal. In addition, each Sun
supporting shareholder has agreed to vote against any proposal made in competition with the merger proposal, as well as certain other
restrictions with respect to the voting and transfer of such Sun supporting shareholder’s shares of Sun common stock. As of the Sun
record date, the Sun supporting shareholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote in the aggregate approximately 39 % of the
outstanding shares of Sun common stock. For more information see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Sun Voting and Support Agreements” beginning on page 108. Additionally, certain provisions of Sun’s certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or of the NJBCA could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of Sun or may discourage a potential
competing acquirer.

The shares of OceanFirst common stock to be received by Sun shareholders as a result of the first-step merger will have different
rights from the shares of Sun common stock.

The rights of Sun shareholders are currently governed by the NJBCA, Sun’s certificate of incorporation and Sun’s bylaws. Upon
completion of the first-step merger, Sun shareholders who receive the stock consideration (either because they elect to receive stock
consideration or because of the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement) will become OceanFirst stockholders and
their rights as OceanFirst stockholders will then be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the
“DGCL”), OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation and OceanFirst’s bylaws. The rights associated with Sun common stock are
different from the rights associated with OceanFirst common stock. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights” beginning on page 127 for a discussion of the different rights associated with OceanFirst
common stock.

Holders of Sun and OceanFirst common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the first-step merger and will
exercise less influence over management.

Holders of Sun and OceanFirst common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors of each such
company and on other matters affecting Sun and OceanFirst, respectively. Upon the completion of the first-step merger, each Sun
shareholder who receives the stock consideration (either because such Sun shareholder elects to receive stock consideration or because
of the allocation and proration provisions

of the merger agreement) will become a OceanFirst stockholder with a percentage ownership of OceanFirst that is smaller than the
stockholder’s percentage ownership of Sun. It is currently expected that the former Sun shareholders as a group will receive shares in
the first-step merger constituting approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of OceanFirst common stock immediately after the first-
step merger. As a result, current OceanFirst stockholders as a group will own approximately 68% of the outstanding shares of
OceanFirst common stock immediately after the first-step merger. Because of this reduced ownership percentage, Sun shareholders
who become OceanFirst stockholders may have less influence on the management and policies of OceanFirst than they now have on
the management and policies of Sun, and current OceanFirst stockholders may have less influence than they now have on the
management and policies of OceanFirst. Upon consummation of the Transactions, OceanFirst has agreed to increase the size of the
OceanFirst board and the board of directors of OceanFirst Bank to fourteen members and appoint two current members of the Sun
board, to be selected by the Leadership Committee of OceanFirst in consultation with the OceanFirst board and the Sun board, to the
OceanFirst board and the board of directors of OceanFirst Bank. Each such appointee will be appointed to a class of the OceanFirst
board and the board of directors of OceanFirst Bank to be selected by OceanFirst in its discretion (provided that such appointees shall
be allocated among the classes as evenly as possible).

Sun shareholders do not have dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the first-step merger.

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value of their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. New Jersey law
provides that a stockholder is not entitled to demand the fair value of his or her shares of stock in any transaction if, among other
things, the stock is listed on a national securities exchange, if cash is to be received or the securities to be received are listed on a
national securities exchange. Because the Sun common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, the holders of Sun common stock are not
entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the first-step merger.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws,
including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. These forward-looking statements may include: management plans relating to the proposed transaction; the expected timing
of the completion of the proposed transaction; the ability to complete the proposed transaction; the ability to obtain any required
regulatory, shareholder or other approvals; any statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, products or
services, including the execution of integration plans relating to the proposed transaction and the recently completed acquisitions of
Cape and Ocean Shore by OceanFirst; any statements of expectation or belief; projections related to certain financial metrics; and any
statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as
“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “seek”, “plan”, “will”, “would”, “target”, “outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project” and
other similar words and expressions or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions,
risks and uncertainties, which change over time and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they
are made. Neither OceanFirst nor Sun assumes any duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Because
forward-looking statements are by their nature, to different degrees, uncertain and subject to assumptions, actual results or future
events could differ, possibly materially, from those that OceanFirst or Sun anticipated in its forward-looking statements, and future
results could differ materially from historical performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are
not limited to, those included under Item 1A “Risk Factors” in OceanFirst’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, those included under Item
1A “Risk Factors” in Sun’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, those disclosed in OceanFirst’s and Sun’s respective other periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as well as the possibility that expected benefits of the proposed
transaction and the Cape and Ocean Shore acquisitions may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly
to achieve; that the proposed transaction may not be timely completed, if at all; that prior to the completion of the proposed transaction
or thereafter, OceanFirst’s and Sun’s respective businesses may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other
factors; that the parties are unable to successfully implement integration strategies related to the proposed transaction and the Cape and
Ocean Shore acquisitions; that required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals are not obtained or other customary closing
conditions are not satisfied in a timely manner or at all; reputational risks and the reaction of the companies’ shareholders, customers,
employees and other constituents to the proposed transaction; and diversion of management time on merger-related matters. Unlisted
factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. For any forward-looking
statements made in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or in any documents, OceanFirst and Sun claim the protection of the safe
harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect
actual results.

Sun Record Date and Quorum

The Sun board has fixed the close of business on September 15, 2017, as the Sun record date for determining the Sun shareholders

As of the Sun record date, there were 19,091,912 shares of Sun common stock outstanding and entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the

the Sun special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence
or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the Sun special meeting.

Required Vote; Treatment of Abstentions, Broker Non-Votes and Failure to Vote

As of the Sun record date, the directors and executive officers of Sun and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote
approximately 2,259,879 shares of Sun common stock (including restricted stock awards), representing approximately 11.84% of the

name as a shareholder of record, to submit a proxy you, as a Sun shareholder, may use one of the following methods:
 

 •  Through the Internet: by visiting the website indicated on your proxy card and following the instructions;
 

 •  By telephone: by calling the toll free number indicated on your proxy card and following the instructions; or
 

 
•  By completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed

Table of Contents

Sun requests that Sun shareholders vote over the Internet, by telephone or by completing and signing the accompanying proxy card and
returning it to Sun as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy card is returned properly
executed, the shares of Sun common stock represented by it will be voted at the Sun special meeting in accordance with the
instructions contained on the proxy card. If any proxy card is returned without indication as to how to vote, the shares of Sun common
stock represented by the proxy card will be voted as recommended by the Sun board.

Every Sun shareholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each Sun shareholder should sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card, or
vote via the Internet or by telephone, whether or not the Sun shareholder plans to attend the Sun special meeting in person. Sending in
your proxy card or voting on the Internet or by telephone will not prevent you from voting your shares personally at the meeting, since
you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

Shares Held in “Street Name”

If you are a Sun shareholder and your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other holder of record, you must
provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by
the bank or broker. Sun shareholders should check the voting form used by that firm to determine whether you may vote by telephone
or the Internet. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Sun or by voting in person at the Sun
special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee. Furthermore, brokers, banks or other
nominees who hold shares of Sun common stock on behalf of their customers will not vote your shares of Sun common stock or give a
proxy to Sun to vote those shares with respect to the Sun merger proposal without specific instructions from you, as brokers, banks and
other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Sun Stockholder’s Vote

You have the power to change your vote at any time before your shares of Sun common stock are voted at the Sun special meeting by:
 

 •  attending and voting in person at the Sun special meeting;
 

 •  giving notice of revocation of the proxy at the Sun special meeting; or
 

 
•  delivering to the Corporate Secretary of Sun at 350 Fellowship Road, Suite 101, Mount Laurel, New Jersey 08054 (i) a

written notice of revocation or (ii) a duly executed proxy card relating to the same shares, bearing a date later than the proxy
card previously executed.

Attendance at the Sun special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be received
before the beginning of the Sun special meeting in order for such revocation to be valid. If you have instructed a bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares of Sun common stock, you must follow the directions you receive from your bank, broker or other
nominee in order to change or revoke your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies

Sun will pay for the solicitation of proxies from the Sun shareholders. Sun will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other
nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting
instructions. Additionally, directors, officers and employees of Sun may solicit proxies personally and by telephone, but none of these
persons will receive additional or special compensation for soliciting proxies.

Attending the Sun Special Meeting

All Sun shareholders, including holders of record and Sun shareholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers, nominees or any
other holder of record, are invited to attend the Sun special meeting. Sun shareholders of record can vote in person at the Sun special
meeting. If you are not a Sun shareholder of record, you must obtain a proxy executed in your favor from the record holder of your
shares, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, to be able to vote in person at the Sun special meeting. If you plan to attend the Sun
special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your
ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted. Sun reserves the right
to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership and without proper photo identification. The use of cameras,
sound recording equipment, communications devices or any similar equipment during the Sun special meeting is prohibited without
Sun’s express written consent.

Delivery of Proxy Materials to Sun Stockholders Sharing an Address

As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to multiple Sun
shareholders sharing an address unless Sun has previously received contrary instructions from one or more such stockholders. This is
referred to as “householding.” Sun shareholders who hold their shares in “street name” can request further information on
householding through their banks, brokers or other holders of record. On written or oral request to Sun Bancorp, Inc., 350 Fellowship
Road, Suite 101, Mount Laurel, New Jersey 08054, Attention: Corporate Secretary or by telephone at (800) 691-7701, Sun will
promptly deliver a separate copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of
the document was delivered.

SUN PROPOSALS

Proposal No. 1 Sun Merger Proposal

Sun is asking its shareholders to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step
merger. Sun shareholders should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes, for more
detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the Transactions. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

After careful consideration, the Sun board unanimously approved the merger agreement, having determined that the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step merger, were advisable and in the best interests of Sun and the Sun
shareholders. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — Sun’s Reasons for the Transactions;
Recommendation of the Sun Board” beginning on page 53 for a more detailed discussion of the Sun board’s recommendation.

The Sun board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Sun merger proposal.

Proposal No. 2 Sun Merger-Related Compensation Proposal

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act, Sun is
seeking non-binding, advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of Sun’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the first-step merger, as disclosed in “The Transactions — Interests of Sun Directors and Executive Officers in the
Transactions — Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Sun’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 82. The proposal
gives Sun shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of Sun’s named executive officers.
Accordingly, Sun is requesting that Sun shareholders adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Sun’s named executive officers in connection with the
first-step merger and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each
case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Transactions — Interests of Sun Directors and Executive Officers
in the Transactions — Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Sun’s Named Executive Officers,” is hereby APPROVED.”

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the integrated mergers, and the vote with respect to this proposal is
advisory only and will not be binding on Sun or OceanFirst. If the first-step merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may
be paid to Sun’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and
arrangements even if Sun shareholders fail to approve the advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation.

The Sun board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR,” on an advisory basis, the Sun merger-related compensation proposal.

Proposal No. 3 Sun Adjournment Proposal

The Sun special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Sun special meeting to approve the Sun merger proposal.

If, at the Sun special meeting, the number of shares of Sun common stock present or represented by proxy and voting in favor of the
Sun merger proposal is insufficient to approve the Sun merger proposal, Sun intends to move to adjourn the Sun special meeting in
order to enable the Sun board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the Sun merger proposal. In that event, Sun will ask its
stockholders to vote upon the Sun adjournment proposal, but not the Sun merger proposal or the Sun merger-related compensation
proposal.

Table of Contents

In this proposal, Sun is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Sun board on a discretionary basis
to vote in favor of adjourning the Sun special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
including the solicitation of proxies from Sun shareholders who have previously voted.

The Sun board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Sun adjournment proposal.

OceanFirst is mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to you, as an OceanFirst stockholder, on or about September 22, 2017. This
joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by a notice of the OceanFirst special meeting and a form of proxy card that the

special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of the OceanFirst Special Meeting

The OceanFirst special meeting will be held at 975 Hooper Avenue, Toms River, New Jersey 08753, at 6:00 p.m. local time, on

enclosed form of proxy card to its stockholders entitled to vote at the OceanFirst special meeting.

Matters to Be Considered

At the OceanFirst special meeting, you, as an OceanFirst stockholder, will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:
 

 •  the OceanFirst share issuance proposal; and
 

 •  the OceanFirst adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of the OceanFirst Board

The OceanFirst board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that OceanFirst stockholders
vote “FOR” the OceanFirst share issuance proposal and “FOR” the OceanFirst adjournment proposal. See the section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions —OceanFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the
OceanFirst Board” beginning on page 68 for a more detailed discussion of the OceanFirst board’s recommendation.

OceanFirst Record Date and Quorum

The OceanFirst board has fixed the close of business on September 15, 2017 as the OceanFirst record date for determining the
OceanFirst stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the OceanFirst special meeting.

As of the OceanFirst record date, there were 32,463,131 shares of OceanFirst common stock outstanding and entitled to notice of, and
to vote at, the OceanFirst special meeting held by approximately 2,158 holders of record. Subject to the ten percent voting limitation
set forth in OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation, each share of OceanFirst common stock entitles the holder to one vote at the
OceanFirst special meeting on each proposal to be considered at the OceanFirst special meeting.

The presence at the OceanFirst special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of OceanFirst common stock entitled to be voted at the OceanFirst special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at the OceanFirst special meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the OceanFirst special meeting, it is
deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the OceanFirst special meeting or for any adjournment(s) thereof.
Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be included in determining the number of shares present at the meeting for the purpose
of determining the presence of a quorum.

Required Vote; Treatment of Abstentions, Broker Non-Votes and Failure to Vote

OceanFirst share issuance proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the OceanFirst share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes

cast by the holders of OceanFirst’s voting common stock at the OceanFirst special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the OceanFirst special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the OceanFirst
share issuance proposal, it will have no effect on the OceanFirst share issuance proposal.

OceanFirst adjournment proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: The OceanFirst adjournment proposal will be approved if a majority of the votes cast by the holders of

OceanFirst’s voting common stock at the OceanFirst special meeting are voted in favor of the OceanFirst adjournment
proposal.

 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the OceanFirst special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the OceanFirst
adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the proposal.

Shares Held by Officers, Directors and Certain Stockholders

As of the OceanFirst record date, there were 32,463,131 shares of OceanFirst common stock outstanding, held by 2,158 holders of
record. As of the OceanFirst record date, the directors and executive officers of OceanFirst and their affiliates beneficially owned and
were entitled to vote approximately 877,430 shares of OceanFirst common stock representing approximately 2.7% of the shares of
OceanFirst common stock outstanding on that date.

As of the OceanFirst record date, Sun did not beneficially hold any shares of OceanFirst common stock.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

Any OceanFirst stockholder may vote by proxy or in person at the OceanFirst special meeting. If you hold your shares of OceanFirst
common stock in your name as a stockholder of record, to submit a proxy, you, as an OceanFirst stockholder, must complete and return
the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in the United States.

OceanFirst requests that OceanFirst stockholders vote by completing and signing the accompanying proxy card and returning it to
OceanFirst as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy card is returned properly
executed, the shares of OceanFirst common stock represented by it will be voted at the OceanFirst special meeting in accordance with
the instructions contained on the proxy card. If any proxy card is returned without indication as to how to vote, the shares of OceanFirst
common stock represented by the proxy card will be voted as recommended by the OceanFirst board.

If an OceanFirst stockholder’s shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, the stockholder should check with
the voting form used by that firm for directions on how to provide such firm with voting instructions.

Every OceanFirst stockholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each OceanFirst stockholder should sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card, whether or not the OceanFirst stockholder plans to attend the OceanFirst special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy
card will not prevent you from voting your shares personally at the meeting, since you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted.

Table of Contents

Shares Held in “Street Name”

Under NASDAQ rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of OceanFirst common stock in “street name” for a
beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not
received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting
discretion with respect to the approval of matters determined to be “non-routine,” without specific instructions from the beneficial
owner. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are represented at the OceanFirst special meeting, but
with respect to which the broker, bank or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular
proposal and the broker, bank or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. If your broker, bank or other
nominee holds your shares of OceanFirst common stock in “street name,” your broker, bank or other nominee will vote your shares of
OceanFirst common stock only if you provide instructions on how to vote by completing the voter instruction form sent to you by your
broker, bank or other nominee.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to an OceanFirst Stockholder’s Vote

You have the power to change your vote at any time before your shares of OceanFirst common stock are voted at the OceanFirst
special meeting by:
 

 •  attending and voting in person at the OceanFirst special meeting;
 

 •  giving notice of revocation of the proxy at the OceanFirst special meeting; or
 

 
•  delivering to the Corporate Secretary of OceanFirst at 975 Hooper Avenue, Toms River, New Jersey 08753 (i) a written

notice of revocation or (ii) a duly executed proxy card relating to the same shares, bearing a date later than the proxy card
previously executed.

Attendance at the OceanFirst special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be received
before the beginning of the OceanFirst special meeting. If you have instructed a bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of
OceanFirst common stock, you must follow the directions you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to change or
revoke your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies

OceanFirst will pay for the solicitation of proxies from the OceanFirst stockholders. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail,
Georgeson LLC, OceanFirst’s proxy solicitor, will assist OceanFirst in soliciting proxies from the OceanFirst stockholders. OceanFirst
has agreed to pay $8,000, plus expenses, for these services. OceanFirst will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other
nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting
instructions. Additionally, directors, officers and employees of OceanFirst may solicit proxies personally and by telephone, but none of
these persons will receive additional or special compensation for soliciting proxies.

Attending the OceanFirst Special Meeting

All OceanFirst stockholders, including holders of record and OceanFirst stockholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers,
nominees or any other holder of record, are invited to attend the OceanFirst special meeting. OceanFirst stockholders of record can
vote in person at the OceanFirst special meeting. If you are not an OceanFirst stockholder of record, you must obtain a proxy executed
in your favor from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, to be able to vote in person at the
OceanFirst special meeting. If you plan to attend the OceanFirst special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or

Delivery of Proxy Materials to OceanFirst Stockholders Sharing an Address

As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to multiple OceanFirst
stockholders sharing an address unless OceanFirst has previously received contrary instructions from one or more such stockholders.
This is referred to as “householding.” OceanFirst stockholders who hold their shares in “street name” can request further information
on householding through their banks, brokers or other holders of record. On written or oral request to Investor Relations at (732)
240-4500 or OceanFirst’s proxy solicitor, Georgeson LLC, at (888) 613-9988, OceanFirst will deliver promptly a separate copy of this

OCEANFIRST PROPOSALS

Proposal No. 1 OceanFirst Share Issuance Proposal

OceanFirst is asking its stockholders to approve the OceanFirst share issuance. OceanFirst stockholders should read this joint proxy
statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes, for more detailed information concerning the merger
agreement, the Transactions and the OceanFirst share issuance. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A.

After careful consideration, the OceanFirst board unanimously approved the merger agreement. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — OceanFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the OceanFirst
Board” beginning on page 68 for a more detailed discussion of the OceanFirst board’s recommendation.

The OceanFirst board unanimously recommends that OceanFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the OceanFirst share issuance
proposal.

Proposal No. 2 OceanFirst Adjournment Proposal

The OceanFirst special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among other things,
further solicitation of proxies as necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the OceanFirst share issuance proposal.

If, at the OceanFirst special meeting, the number of shares of OceanFirst common stock present or represented by proxy and voting in
favor of the OceanFirst share issuance proposal is insufficient to approve the OceanFirst share issuance proposal, OceanFirst intends to
move to adjourn the OceanFirst special meeting in order to enable the OceanFirst board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the
Sun share issuance proposal. In that event, OceanFirst will ask its stockholders to vote upon the OceanFirst adjournment proposal, but
not the OceanFirst share issuance proposal.

In this proposal, OceanFirst is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the OceanFirst board on a
discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the OceanFirst special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from OceanFirst stockholders who have previously voted.

The OceanFirst board unanimously recommends that OceanFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the OceanFirst adjournment
proposal.

THE TRANSACTIONS

The following discussion contains certain information about the Transactions. The discussion is subject, and qualified in its entirety by
reference, to the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by reference.
We urge you to read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement attached as Annex A, for a
more complete understanding of the Transactions.

Structure of the Transactions

Each of the OceanFirst board and the Sun board has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that
(i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Sun, with Sun continuing as the surviving corporation in the first-step merger and as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of OceanFirst, (ii) immediately following the first-step merger, Sun will merge with and into OceanFirst, with
OceanFirst continuing as the surviving corporation in the second-step merger and (iii) immediately following the completion of the
integrated mergers, Sun National Bank will merge with and into OceanFirst Bank, with OceanFirst Bank being the surviving entity in
the bank merger.

At the time the first-step merger is completed, each outstanding share of Sun common stock, except for certain shares of Sun common
stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive either (i) the cash consideration, which is an amount in
cash equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by the OceanFirst share closing price, or (ii) the stock
consideration, which will be a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the exchange ratio, which is the quotient of
(A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the OceanFirst share closing price. Holders of Sun common stock will have the right to elect
to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.
The merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the
total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.

OceanFirst will not issue any fractional shares of OceanFirst common stock in the first-step merger. Sun shareholders who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of OceanFirst common stock upon the completion of the first-step merger will
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying the fraction of a share (rounded
to the nearest thousandth when expressed as a decimal form) of OceanFirst common stock to which the holder would otherwise be
entitled by the OceanFirst share closing price.

Sun shareholders are being asked to approve the merger agreement and the first-step merger. OceanFirst stockholders are being asked
to approve the OceanFirst share issuance. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement”
beginning on page 87 for additional and more detailed information regarding the legal documents that govern the Transactions,
including information about the conditions to the completion of the integrated mergers and the provisions for terminating or amending
the merger agreement.

Background of the Transactions

In connection with their ongoing consideration and evaluation of their respective long-term prospects and strategies, each of the Sun
board and the OceanFirst board, as well as senior management of both such companies, have considered and regularly reviewed their
respective strategic direction and business objectives, including by evaluating potential strategic transactions, as part of their
continuous efforts to enhance value for Sun shareholders and OceanFirst stockholders, respectively. These considerations have focused
on, among other things, prospects and developments in the regulatory environment, in the economy generally and in financial markets,
for financial institutions generally and Sun and OceanFirst, respectively, in particular, as well as conditions and ongoing consolidation
in the financial services industry.

From time to time, Sun has had general conversations with other financial institutions regarding the possibility of a potential future
strategic transaction, and Sun’s senior management has discussed this topic with the Sun board and Sun’s financial advisors, but none
of these conversations developed into more formal discussions or negotiations. These conversations have included reviews of the
banking market, as well as industry trends and developments in mergers and acquisitions.

On January 18, 2017, Christopher Maher, the chief executive officer of OceanFirst, and Thomas O’Brien, the chief executive officer of
Sun, met to discuss the possibility of a strategic transaction between the two companies. Mr. Maher noted that OceanFirst was
interested in expanding northward in New Jersey, and that the two companies might be a good strategic fit. Following the meeting,
Mr. O’Brien informed the Sun board of his conversation with Mr. Maher. The Sun board authorized Mr. O’Brien to continue engaging
in discussions with Mr. Maher regarding a strategic transaction.

Messrs. Maher and O’Brien met again on April 20, 2017 to discuss their respective companies and the merits of a potential
combination. On May 11, 2017, Mr. O’Brien informed the Sun board that he would be meeting again with Mr. Maher prior to the
OceanFirst board meeting scheduled for May 24, 2017. Messrs. Maher and O’Brien met again on May 18 and May 23, 2017 to
continue to discuss their respective companies and the merits of a potential combination.

At a regularly scheduled meeting of the OceanFirst board held on May 24, 2017, OceanFirst senior management reviewed with the
OceanFirst board the potential transaction with Sun, and the OceanFirst board authorized Mr. Maher and senior management of
OceanFirst to continue discussions with Sun.

On May 30, 2017, the Sun board held a special meeting. At the special meeting, Mr. O’Brien updated the Sun board on his
conversations with Mr. Maher and informed the Sun board that OceanFirst was interested in pursuing a transaction with Sun.
Mr. O’Brien discussed the potential benefits of such a transaction, and reviewed with the Sun board some of the past strategic
initiatives considered by Sun, the significant changes that had taken place over the past several years at Sun as it transitioned from a
deeply troubled institution to its current well capitalized condition, and the general performance and prospects of the company.
Representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, outside counsel to Sun (which we refer to as “Wachtell Lipton”) also attended the
meeting and discussed generally the process and legal standards that would apply in the event that Sun were to seek to undertake a
potential transaction with OceanFirst. Following review and discussion among the Sun board members, the Sun board authorized
Mr. O’Brien and other members of Sun’s management to engage in further discussions with OceanFirst to evaluate the merits of a
potential combination.

On June 1, 2017, Mr. O’Brien communicated to Mr. Maher the results of the Sun board meeting of May 30, 2017, including that the
Sun board authorized Sun to enter into a confidentiality agreement with OceanFirst. On June 5, 2017, Sun and OceanFirst entered into
a confidentiality agreement in order to enable the parties to commence their respective due diligence investigations and consider and
evaluate the potential merits of a combination.

On June 7, 2017, representatives of Sandler O’Neill, financial advisor to Sun, and representatives of Piper, financial advisor to
OceanFirst, met at the offices of Piper to begin to help facilitate the due diligence efforts of the parties. As a result, the parties
commenced due diligence efforts on June 7, 2017, which efforts continued over the next several weeks and included in person
management meetings on June 20, 2017. Also during this period, Messrs. Maher and O’Brien, with the assistance of the respective
financial advisors of OceanFirst and Sun, discussed the pro forma contributions of each of Sun and OceanFirst to the potential
combined company, potential cost savings and merger-related expenses, and each entity’s pro forma ownership of the potential
combined company relative to its respective contribution, and an estimated exchange ratio range.

At a regularly scheduled meeting of the OceanFirst board held on June 21, 2017, Mr. Maher updated the OceanFirst board about the
progress of the potential transaction with Sun, including the status of due diligence, and indicated he would keep the OceanFirst board
apprised of the status of the potential transaction. Also on June 21, 2017, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager & Flom LLP, outside counsel
to OceanFirst (which we refer to as

“Skadden”), provided Wachtell Lipton a draft merger agreement and the parties began to negotiate transaction documentation
simultaneously with the ongoing due diligence investigations.

On June 22, 2017, the Sun board held a special meeting at which Mr. O’Brien updated the Sun board regarding the discussions with
OceanFirst. Among other things, Mr. O’Brien noted that the exchange ratio for the proposed transaction would likely reflect a modest
premium to Sun’s current market price in light of the parties’ relative contributions to the combined company and Sun’s current trading
price relative to earnings. Mr. O’Brien also reviewed with the Sun board the progress that Sun had made on its turn-around efforts.
Mr. O’Brien noted that the overwhelming majority of progress had been accomplished, and the remainder of Sun’s operational and
growth plans would take significant additional time to achieve. After discussion among the Sun board members, the Sun board
authorized Mr. O’Brien to continue to work with OceanFirst with respect to the potential combination.

During the weekend of June 23, 2017, Skadden provided Wachtell Lipton a draft voting and support agreement that OceanFirst
proposed to require WLR SBI Acquisition Co, LLC, Bernard A. Brown, Sidney R. Brown, Jeffrey S. Brown, Ike Brown, Anne E.
Koons and certain of their affiliates, which were among the largest shareholders of Sun, to execute in connection with a proposed
transaction. The draft voting and support agreement would require each signatory to, among other things, vote in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement. The parties, together with the proposed shareholder parties, began to negotiate the support agreements
simultaneously with the merger agreement.

On June 26, 2017, Mr. O’Brien and Mr. Maher discussed the current status of the discussions between the parties regarding the
proposed transaction, which included a discussion regarding the merger consideration to be paid in the proposed transaction based on a
potential fixed exchange ratio of 0.9275 shares of OceanFirst common stock for each share of Sun common stock, with an opportunity
for Sun’s shareholders to elect to receive a portion of the merger consideration in cash. During this discussion, Mr. Maher indicated that
OceanFirst would agree to add two persons to the OceanFirst board to be selected from the persons currently serving on the Sun board.

On June 27, 2017, the Sun board held a special meeting to review and consider the proposed transaction with OceanFirst and other
matters. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill and Wachtell Lipton participated in the meeting. Prior to the meeting, the directors
received copies of a summary of the terms of the merger agreement and related matters from Wachtell Lipton, as well as materials
prepared by Sandler O’Neill. At the meeting, members of Sun management updated the Sun board on the status of negotiations with
OceanFirst and their due diligence efforts. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill also discussed with the Sun board the proposed financial
terms of the proposed transaction, updated the Sun board on market and industry conditions, discussed the absence of interest by other
potential transaction parties based on their past contacts with and knowledge of other industry participants, and provided a financial
analysis of Sun, OceanFirst and the combined pro forma company. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Sun board its
fiduciary duties in connection with a potential strategic business combination transaction and reviewed the extensive process the Sun
board had conducted to date. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also reviewed the terms of the draft merger agreement, the draft
voting and support agreement, the impact of the proposed transaction on executives and other employees, and discussed timing for
approvals and other contingencies. Based on this review, and following discussion among the members of the Sun board, the Sun board
authorized and directed management and Sun’s legal and financial advisors to continue to work to seek to finalize the terms of
definitive documentation with OceanFirst. At the meeting, the Sun board also considered and approved, with the recommendation of
the Sun board compensation committee, the employment and change-in- control agreements with Mr. O’Brien. In Sun’s annual
shareholder meeting proxy statement, dated March 30, 2017, Sun had disclosed that it had anticipated entering into a change-in-control
agreement with Mr. O’Brien in the second half of 2017.

Over the next two days, the parties worked to finalize their due diligence investigations and the definitive transaction documentation.

On June 29, 2017, the OceanFirst board held a special meeting to review and consider the proposed transaction. Representatives of
Piper and Skadden attended the meeting. Prior to the meeting, the OceanFirst board received copies of the draft merger agreement and
a summary of the terms of the merger agreement and related matters from Skadden, as well as materials prepared by Piper. At the
meeting, members of OceanFirst’s management team updated the OceanFirst board on the status of negotiations with Sun and reviewed
with the OceanFirst board the results of management’s due diligence investigation of Sun. Skadden reviewed the terms of the draft
merger agreement with the OceanFirst board. Piper reviewed with the OceanFirst board the financial aspects of the proposed
transaction and Piper’s financial analysis of the merger consideration, and Piper rendered its written opinion to the OceanFirst board
that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by
OceanFirst pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to OceanFirst. See “Opinion of OceanFirst’s
Financial Advisor.”

Following these discussions, and after consideration of the matters set forth under “— OceanFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions;
Recommendation of the OceanFirst Board,” the OceanFirst board unanimously determined that the merger agreement, and the
transactions contemplated thereby, were advisable and in the best interests of, OceanFirst and its stockholders, and approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the integrated mergers and the bank merger, and resolved to
recommend that the OceanFirst stockholders approve the OceanFirst share issuance at a stockholders’ meeting duly called and held for
such purpose.

Also on June 29, 2017, the Sun board held another special meeting to review and consider the proposed transaction. Representatives of
Sandler O’Neill and Wachtell Lipton attended the meeting. Prior to the meeting, the directors received copies of the draft merger
agreement and an updated summary of the terms of the merger agreement and related matters from Wachtell Lipton, as well as
materials prepared by Sandler O’Neill. At the meeting, members of Sun’s management team updated the Sun board on the progression
of negotiations with OceanFirst since the last meeting of the Sun board. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed the terms of the
draft merger agreement with the Sun board.

Also at the June 29, 2017 meeting of the Sun board and at the request of Sun, Sandler O’Neill reviewed with the Sun board the
financial aspects of the proposed transaction and Sandler O’Neill’s financial analysis of the per share merger consideration and
rendered to the Sun board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by to the holders of Sun common stock in the
integrated mergers was fair to such holders from a financial point of view. See “Opinion of Sun’s Financial Advisor.”

Following these discussions, and after consideration of the matters set forth under “— Sun’s Reasons for the Transactions;
Recommendation of the Sun Board,” the Sun board unanimously determined that the merger agreement, and the transactions
contemplated thereby, were advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Sun and its shareholders, and approved the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the integrated mergers and the bank merger, and resolved to recommend that the
merger agreement be adopted by Sun’s shareholders at a shareholders’ meeting duly called and held for such purpose.

Subsequently, during the morning of June 30, 2017, the parties entered into the merger agreement and publicly announced the
execution of the merger agreement the same day. Also during the morning of June 30, 2017, OceanFirst entered into separate voting
and support agreements with certain significant Sun shareholders. See “The Sun Voting and Support Agreements.”

Sun’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Sun Board

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the integrated mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and to recommend that the Sun shareholders approve the Sun merger proposal, the Sun board consulted with Sun
management, as well as its financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors in favor of the Transactions, including the
following factors:
 

 •  each of Sun and OceanFirst’s business, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings and future prospects;
 

 •  the anticipated economies of scale for the combined company;
 

 
•  the anticipated pro forma impact of the Transactions on the combined company, including the expected impact on financial

metrics, including earnings, dividend accretion, profitability ratios, tangible book value dilution (and associated earn-back
period) and regulatory capital levels;

 

 
•  the current and prospective environment in which Sun and OceanFirst operate, including national and local economic

conditions, the interest rate environment, the competitive and regulatory environments for financial institutions generally,
and the likely effect of these factors on Sun without the Transactions, and on the combined company with the Transactions;

 

 
•  the historical performance of Sun common stock, and the factors influencing its current trading value, as well as strengths

and weakness of Sun operating in the future on an independent basis;
 

 
•  the historical performance of OceanFirst common stock and the level of future cash dividends anticipated to be received by

Sun’s shareholders;
 

 •  OceanFirst’s record of performance, including its earnings record;
 

 •  the soundness of OceanFirst’s financial condition and asset quality;
 

 
•  publicly available information regarding OceanFirst’s regulatory status, and OceanFirst’s indications that it was unaware of

any meaningful obstacle to obtaining regulatory approvals;
 

 
•  the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the combined

company, given its larger size, asset base, capital and footprint;
 

 
•  the significant transformation that Sun had achieved since hiring Mr. O’Brien in 2014, and the view that the majority of the

transformation achievable had been accomplished and that further improvements would be less significant and would
require an extended time frame to accomplish;

 

 

•  the implied value of the merger consideration of $25.18 per share as of June 28, 2017, which represented a premium of 2.2%
over the closing price of Sun common stock on that date, 169% of Sun’s tangible book value per share as of March 31, 2017,
89.9 times annualized first quarter 2017 earnings per share, and 61.4 times 2017 estimated Wall Street equity research
consensus mean per share earnings;

 

 
•  the form of consideration and the fact that a significant portion of the merger consideration would be in stock and with a

fixed exchange ratio, which would allow Sun’s shareholders to participate in the future performance of the combined
company;

 

 
•  the cash component of the transaction offers Sun’s shareholders the opportunity to realize cash for the value of their shares

of Sun common stock with immediate certainty of value, subject to proration;
 

 
•  the cash/stock election mechanism of the merger agreement, which offers Sun’s shareholders the opportunity to seek their

preferred form of consideration, subject to proration, and with an equalization mechanic intended to ensure that Sun’s
shareholders receive comparable value, as of the closing, regardless of the form of consideration ultimately received;

 

 
•  the expected tax treatment of the integrated mergers, taken together, as a “reorganization” for United States federal income

tax purposes;

•  the opinion of Sandler O’Neill, dated June 29, 2017, delivered to the Sun board to the effect that, as of that date, and subject
to and based on the various assumptions, considerations, qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of Sun common stock in the integrated mergers was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Sun common stock; and

 

 
•  the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and their comparability to those in other recent merger transactions in the

banking industry.

The Sun board also considered the potential risks related to the Transactions, but concluded that the anticipated benefits of the
Transactions were likely to substantially outweigh these risks. The potential risks included:
 

 
•  the potential risks associated with integrating Sun’s and OceanFirst’s operations, including integrating their workforces, and

the ability to achieve anticipated synergies;
 

 •  the transaction-related restructuring charges and other merger-related costs;
 

 
•  with most of the merger consideration consisting of OceanFirst common stock, the potential for the implied value of the

merger consideration to be paid to Sun shareholders to be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of OceanFirst
common stock;

 

 
•  the nature and amount of payments to be received by Sun’s management in connection with the Transactions, including as

described in “— Interests of Sun’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions;”
 

 
•  the fact that the merger agreement includes certain provisions that prohibit Sun from soliciting alternative transactions and

from taking certain actions in response to unsolicited proposals for alternative transactions;
 

 •  Sun’s obligation to pay OceanFirst a termination fee of $17.045 million in certain circumstances;
 

 
•  the potential for diversion of management and employee attention from the operation of Sun’s business and towards the

completion of the Transactions as well as the potential for employee attrition and the potential effect on Sun’s relationships
with customers, service providers and other stakeholders during the pendency of the Transactions;

 

 
•  the potential that Sun shareholders may not receive the form of consideration that they elect to receive as a result of the

allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the Transactions and the possibility that such regulatory

approvals will not be received in a timely manner or may impose unacceptable conditions; and
 

 •  the potential for legal claims challenging the Transactions.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Sun board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the
material factors considered by the Sun board. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Sun board did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors
considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Sun board considered all these factors as
a whole and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

Opinion of Sun’s Financial Advisor

By letter dated June 29, 2017, Sun retained Sandler O’Neill to act as financial advisor to the Sun board in connection with Sun’s
consideration of a possible business combination. Sandler O’Neill is a nationally recognized investment banking firm whose principal
business specialty is financial institutions. In the ordinary course of its investment banking business, Sandler O’Neill is regularly
engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate
transactions. The Sun board also considered the fact that Sandler O’Neill was familiar with Sun and its business.

Sandler O’Neill acted as Sun’s financial advisor in connection with the integrated mergers and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to the execution of the merger agreement. At the June 29, 2017 meeting at which Sun board considered and
approved the merger agreement, Sandler O’Neill delivered to the Sun board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in
writing, to the effect that, as of such date, the merger consideration provided for in the merger was fair to the holders of Sun common
stock from a financial point of view.

The full text of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The Sandler O’Neill
opinion outlines the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion set forth below is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Sun shareholders are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in
connection with their consideration of the Sun merger proposal.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was directed to the Sun board in connection
with its consideration of the integrated mergers and is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger consideration to the holders of Sun common stock. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
any Sun shareholder as to how such Sun shareholder should vote at any meeting of Sun shareholders called to consider and
vote upon the Sun merger proposal. It does not address the underlying business decision of Sun to engage in the integrated
mergers, the form or structure of the integrated mergers, the relative merits of the integrated mergers as compared to any
other alternative business strategies that might exist for Sun or the effect of any other transaction in which Sun might engage.
Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the
integrated mergers by Sun’s officers, directors, or employees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation to be received in
the integrated mergers by any other Sun shareholder. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion
committee.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed, among other things:
 

 •  a draft of the merger agreement, dated June 29, 2017;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Sun that Sandler O’Neill deemed

relevant;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of OceanFirst and its banking

subsidiary that Sandler O’Neill deemed relevant;
 

 
•  publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through

December 31, 2019, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter, as
provided by the senior management of Sun;

 

 

•  publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for OceanFirst for the years ending December 31, 2017, as
presented on a core basis, and December 31, 2018, excluding certain analyst estimates which incorporate a prospective
reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate
and estimated dividends per share for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst;

 

 

•  the pro forma financial impact of the integrated mergers on OceanFirst based on certain assumptions relating to transaction
expenses, purchase accounting adjustments (including the estimated realization of Sun’s existing deferred tax asset), cost
savings and a core deposit intangible asset, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst, as well as financial
projections for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as provided by the senior
management of OceanFirst and based upon publicly available analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years
ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019 and an estimated long-term earnings per share growth rate for the
years thereafter;

 

 
•  the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for Sun common stock and OceanFirst common stock, including a

comparison of certain stock market information for Sun and OceanFirst

common stock and certain stock indices as well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies, the
securities of which are publicly traded;

 

 
•  a comparison of certain financial information for Sun and OceanFirst with similar banks and thrifts for which information is

publicly available;
 

 
•  the financial terms of certain recent mergers and business combinations in the bank and thrift industry (on a regional and

national basis), to the extent publicly available;
 

 •  the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and
 

 
•  such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria as we

considered relevant.

Sandler O’Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Sun the business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects of Sun and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior management of OceanFirst regarding
the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of OceanFirst.

In performing its review, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that
was available to and reviewed by Sandler O’Neill from public sources, that was provided to Sandler O’Neill by Sun or OceanFirst, or
their respective representatives, or that was otherwise reviewed by Sandler O’Neill and Sandler O’Neill assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion without any independent verification or investigation. Sandler O’Neill further relied
on the assurances of the respective managements of Sun and OceanFirst that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would have made any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Sandler O’Neill was not asked to and did not undertake an
independent verification of any of such information and Sandler O’Neill did not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy
or completeness thereof. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the
collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Sun or OceanFirst, or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor
was Sandler O’Neill furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Sandler O’Neill rendered no opinion or evaluation on the
collectability of any assets or the future performance of any loans of Sun or OceanFirst. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of Sun or OceanFirst, or the combined company after the integrated
mergers, and Sandler O’Neill did not review any individual credit files relating to Sun or OceanFirst. Sandler O’Neill assumed, with
Sun’s consent, that the respective allowances for loan losses for both Sun and OceanFirst are adequate to cover such losses and will be
adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined company.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years
ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate for
the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of Sun. In addition, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus
analyst earnings per share estimates for OceanFirst for the years ending December 31, 2017, as presented on a core basis, and
December 31, 2018, excluding certain analyst estimates which incorporate a prospective reduction to the federal corporate income tax
rate, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate and estimated dividends per share for the years
thereafter, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst. Sandler O’Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses
certain assumptions relating to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments (including the estimated realization of Sun’s
existing deferred tax asset), cost savings and a core deposit intangible asset, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst, as
well as financial projections for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as provided by the senior
management of OceanFirst and based upon publicly available analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years ending
December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019 and an estimated long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter.
With respect to the foregoing information, the respective managements of Sun and OceanFirst confirmed to Sandler O’Neill that such
information reflected (or, in the case of the publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates referred to above, were
consistent with) the best currently

available projections, estimates and judgments of those respective senior managements of the future financial performance of Sun and
OceanFirst, respectively, and Sandler O’Neill assumed that such performance would be achieved. Sandler O’Neill expressed no
opinion as to such projections, estimates or judgments, or the assumptions on which they were based. Sandler O’Neill also assumed
that there had been no material change in Sun’s or OceanFirst’s assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects
since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to Sandler O’Neill. Sandler O’Neill assumed in all respects
material to Sandler O’Neill’s analysis that Sun and OceanFirst will remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to Sandler
O’Neill’s analyses.

In arriving at its opinion, Sandler O’Neill assumed, with Sun’s consent, that (i) each of the parties to the merger agreement will comply
in all material respects with all material terms and conditions of the merger agreement and all related agreements, that all of the
representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to such
agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under
such agreements and that the conditions precedent in such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the integrated mergers, no delay, limitation,
restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Sun, OceanFirst or the integrated mergers or any related
transaction that would be material to Sandler O’Neill’s analyses, (iii) the integrated mergers and any related transactions will be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material
term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements and (iv) the integrated mergers
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to any of the
legal, accounting or tax matters relating to the integrated mergers or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Sandler O’Neill’s analyses and opinion were necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and
the information made available to Sandler O’Neill as of, the date of its opinion. Events occurring after the date thereof could materially
affect Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. Sandler O’Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion or otherwise
comment upon events occurring after the date thereof. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to the trading values of Sun
common stock or OceanFirst common stock at any time or what the value of OceanFirst common stock will be once it is actually
received by the holders of Sun common stock.

In performing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of Sandler O’Neill, Sun and OceanFirst.
Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Sandler O’Neill are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the values of businesses
or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold.
Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was
among several factors taken into consideration by the Sun board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the
integrated mergers. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Sun board
with respect to the fairness of the merger consideration. The type and amount of consideration payable in the integrated mergers were
determined through negotiation between Sun and OceanFirst and the decision of Sun to enter into the merger agreement was solely that
of the Sun board.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Sandler O’Neill to the Sun board on June 29, 2017 in
connection with its opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the
presentation made by Sandler O’Neill to the Sun board, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection
with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses, these tables must be read together with the accompanying text. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete

description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various
determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Sandler O’Neill did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Sandler O’Neill believes that its analyses and
the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the
information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

Summary of Proposed Merger Consideration and Implied Transaction Metrics

Sandler O’Neill reviewed the financial terms of the merger agreement. In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, at the
effective time, each share of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding certain
shares of Sun common stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst or any of their respective subsidiaries) will be entitled to receive either
(i) the cash consideration, which will be an amount in cash equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by
the OceanFirst share closing price or (ii) the stock consideration, which will be a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal
to the quotient of (A) the cash consideration described in clause (i) divided by (B) the OceanFirst share closing price. The right to
receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration will be made at the election of each holder of Sun common stock, subject to
the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. Using OceanFirst’s June 28, 2017 closing stock price of $27.15, and
based upon the following (as provided by Sun management), (a) 19,060,593 shares of Sun common stock outstanding, (b) 127,808
outstanding Sun restricted stock awards and units, and (c) 556,694 Sun options outstanding with a weighted average strike price of
$22.03, Sandler O’Neill calculated an implied value of the per share merger consideration of $25.18 and an aggregate implied value of
the merger consideration of $484.9 million.

Sandler O’Neill calculated the following implied transaction metrics:
 
Merger Consideration / Last Twelve Months (“LTM”) Ended March 31, 2017 Earnings Per Share1    89.9x 
Merger Consideration / 2017 Mean Analyst Estimated Earnings Per Share2    61.4x 
Merger Consideration / 2018 Mean Analyst Estimated Earnings Per Share2    46.6x 
Merger Consideration / March 31, 2017 Book Value per Share3    141% 
Merger Consideration / March 31, 2017 Tangible Book Value per Share3    169% 
Merger Consideration / March 31, 2017 Adjusted Tangible Book Value per Share4    159% 
Tangible Book Premium / Core Deposits5    12.9% 
Market Premium as of June 28, 2017    2.2% 
 
(1) Due to partial reversal of Sun’s deferred tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2016, Sun’s Price / LTM EPS reflects Price / Last Quarter Annualized diluted EPS.
(2) Sun’s 2017E & 2018E estimated earnings per share as per Wall Street research consensus equity research analyst mean estimates as of June 28, 2017.
(3) Sun book value and tangible book value per share as of March 31, 2017 and based on 19,060,593 shares of Sun common stock outstanding.
(4) Sun’s adjusted tangible book value per share assumes the full reversal of Sun’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $73.2 million as of March 31, 2017. Based on 19,060,593 shares of

Sun common stock outstanding.
(5) Core deposits defined as total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000 as of March 31, 2017.

Net Present Value Analyses

Sandler O’Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Sun’s common stock, assuming publicly
available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019,
as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management
of Sun. To approximate the terminal value of Sun common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2021 earnings
multiples ranging from 14.0x to 22.0x and multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value ranging from 125% to 200%. The
terminal values were then discounted to present values using different discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 13.5%, which were chosen
to reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of Sun common stock. As illustrated
in the following tables, the analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of Sun common stock of $5.95 to $10.52 when
applying multiples of earnings and $12.28 to $22.22 when applying multiples of tangible book value.

Sandler O’Neill also considered and discussed with the Sun board how this analysis would be affected by changes in the underlying
assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Sandler O’Neill performed a similar analysis,
assuming Sun’s net income varied from 15% above estimates to 15% below estimates. This analysis resulted in the following range of
per share values for Sun common stock, applying the price to 2021 earnings multiples range of 14.0x to 22.0x referred to above and a
discount rate of 12.76%.

Sandler O’Neill also performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Sun’s common stock, assuming the full
reversal of the estimated deferred tax valuation allowance at the end of 2019 of approximately $61.0 million. The analysis also
assumed publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through
December 31, 2019, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter, as provided by
the senior management of Sun. To approximate the terminal value of Sun common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O’Neill
applied multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value ranging from 110% to 160%. The terminal values were then discounted to
present values using different discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 13.5%, which were chosen to reflect different assumptions
regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of Sun common stock. As illustrated in the following table, the
analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of Sun common stock of $12.76 to $21.01 when applying multiples of tangible
book value.

Sandler O’Neill also performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of OceanFirst common stock, assuming that
OceanFirst performed in accordance with publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for the years ending
December 31, 2017, as presented on a core basis, and December 31, 2018, excluding research estimates that incorporate a prospective
reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, and estimated internal long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth
rates for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst. To approximate the terminal value of OceanFirst
common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2021 earnings multiples ranging from 15.0x to 24.0x and
multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value ranging from 175% to 250%. The terminal values were then discounted to present
values using different discount rates ranging from 9.5% to 12.5%, which were chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding
required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of OceanFirst common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the
analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of OceanFirst common stock of $22.67 to $39.38 when applying earnings
multiples and $22.35 to $34.91 when applying multiples of tangible book value.

Sandler O’Neill also considered and discussed with the Sun board how this analysis would be affected by changes in the underlying
assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Sandler O’Neill performed a similar analysis
assuming OceanFirst’s net income varied from 15% above estimates to 15% below estimates. This analysis resulted in the following
range of per share values for OceanFirst common stock, applying the price to 2021 earnings multiples range of 15.0x to 24.0x referred
to above and a discount rate of 10.84%.

In connection with its analyses, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the Sun board how the present value analyses would be
affected by changes in the underlying assumptions. Sandler O’Neill noted that the net present value analysis is a widely used valuation
methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous assumptions that must be made, and the
results thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis

Sandler O’Neill analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the integrated mergers assuming the integrated mergers close during the
first quarter of 2018 and assuming the aggregate mix of cash and stock consideration in

Table of Contents

the integrated mergers is equal to approximately $72.5 million in cash and 15.1 million shares of OceanFirst common stock. Sandler
O’Neill utilized the following: (i) publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years ending
December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years
thereafter, as provided by the senior management of Sun, (ii) publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for
OceanFirst for the years ending December 31, 2017, as presented on a core basis, and December 31, 2018, excluding certain analyst
estimates which incorporate a prospective reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, as well as an estimated internal long-term
earnings per share growth rate and estimated dividends per share for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of
OceanFirst, and (iii) the pro forma financial impact of the integrated mergers on OceanFirst based on certain assumptions relating to
transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments (including the estimated realization of Sun’s existing deferred tax asset), cost
savings and a core deposit intangible asset, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst, as well as financial projections for
Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as provided by the senior management of OceanFirst and
based upon publicly available analyst earnings per share estimates for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017 through
December 31, 2019 and an estimated long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter. The analysis indicated that the
integrated mergers could be accretive to earnings per share for Sun in 2018 and the years thereafter and dilutive to tangible book value
per share for Sun at closing.

In connection with this analysis, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the Sun board how the analysis would be affected by
changes in the underlying assumptions and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected
results and the variations may be material.

Sandler O’Neill’s Relationship

Sandler O’Neill is acting as Sun’s financial advisor in connection with the integrated mergers and, upon the closing of the integrated
mergers, will receive a transaction fee for its services estimated to be approximately $4.5 million based on the market value of
OceanFirst common stock at the time the integrated mergers were announced. Sandler O’Neill’s transaction fee is equal to 0.92% of the
aggregate merger consideration, will vary based on the market value of OceanFirst common stock at the time of closing and is
contingent upon the closing of the integrated mergers. Sandler O’Neill also received a fee of $400,000 for rendering its opinion, which
opinion fee will be credited in full towards the transaction fee becoming payable to Sandler O’Neill on the day of closing of the
integrated mergers. Sun has also agreed to indemnify Sandler O’Neill against certain liabilities arising out of Sandler O’Neill’s
engagement and to reimburse Sandler O’Neill for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement.

Sandler O’Neill did not provide any other investment banking services to Sun in the two years preceding the date of its opinion. As
Sandler O’Neill previously disclosed to the Sun board, in the two years preceding the date of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion, Sandler
O’Neill provided certain investment banking services to, and received investment banking fees from, OceanFirst. Most recently,
Sandler O’Neill acted as book-running manager in connection with OceanFirst’s offer and sale of subordinated notes, which transaction
closed in September 2016. In addition, Sandler O’Neill acted as financial advisor to OceanFirst in connection with the Cape
acquisition, which transaction closed in May 2016. In the ordinary course of Sandler O’Neill’s business as a broker-dealer, Sandler
O’Neill may purchase securities from and sell securities to Sun, OceanFirst and their respective affiliates. Sandler O’Neill may also
actively trade the equity and debt securities of Sun and OceanFirst or their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts
of its customers.

OceanFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the OceanFirst Board

After careful consideration, the OceanFirst board, at a meeting held on June 29, 2017, unanimously approved the merger agreement.
Accordingly, the OceanFirst board unanimously recommends that OceanFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the OceanFirst share issuance
proposal.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the integrated mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and to recommend that its stockholders approve the OceanFirst share

issuance, the OceanFirst board evaluated the merger agreement and the Transactions in consultation with OceanFirst management, as
well as OceanFirst’s legal counsel and financial advisor, and considered a number of factors in favor of the Transactions, including the
following material factors, which are not presented in order of priority:
 

 
•  the fact that the Transactions are expected to strengthen OceanFirst’s position as the largest bank headquartered in central

and southern New Jersey;
 

 
•  the fact that the Transactions strengthen and expand OceanFirst’s franchise into new, more demographically attractive New

Jersey, Philadelphia and New York metro markets;
 

 
•  the fact that the enhanced scale expected to result from the Transactions is expected to enlarge OceanFirst’s commercial

banking business to $3.1 billion in total loans;
 

 
•  each of OceanFirst’s and Sun’s businesses, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings and prospects, including

the view of the OceanFirst board that Sun’s business and operations complement OceanFirst’s existing operations and lines
of business;

 

 
•  the current and prospective environment in which OceanFirst and Sun operate, including national, regional and local

economic conditions, the competitive environment for financial institutions generally and the likely effect of these factors on
OceanFirst both with and without the Transactions;

 

 
•  its review and discussions with OceanFirst’s management and its legal counsel and financial advisor concerning the due

diligence investigation of Sun and the potential financial impact of the Transactions on the combined company;
 

 •  management’s expectation that OceanFirst will retain its strong capital position upon completion of the Transactions;
 

 

•  the financial presentation, dated June 29, 2017, of Piper to the OceanFirst board and the opinion, dated June 29, 2017, of
Piper to the OceanFirst board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to
OceanFirst of the merger consideration, as more fully described below under the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “— Opinion of OceanFirst’s Financial Advisor;”

 

 
•  the terms of the merger agreement, including the expected tax treatment and deal protection and termination fee provisions,

which it reviewed with OceanFirst’s outside legal and financial advisors; and
 

 
•  the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the Transactions and the expectation that such regulatory and

other approvals will be received in a timely manner and without the imposition of unacceptable conditions.

The OceanFirst board also considered potential risks associated with the Transactions in connection with its deliberations of the
Transactions, including (i) the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of OceanFirst’s
business and towards the completion of the Transactions; (ii) the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies
and savings and successfully integrating Sun’s business, operations and workforce with those of OceanFirst; and (iii) the other risks
identified in the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 27 and “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 34.

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the OceanFirst board is not intended to be exhaustive, but, rather, includes the
material factors considered by the OceanFirst board. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the integrated mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The OceanFirst board did not quantify or assign any relative weights
to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The OceanFirst board
considered all these factors as a whole and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination. It should

noted that this explanation of the OceanFirst board’s reasoning and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in
nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 34.

For the reasons set forth above, the OceanFirst approved the merger agreement. The OceanFirst board unanimously recommends that
the OceanFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the OceanFirst share issuance proposal and “FOR” the OceanFirst adjournment proposal.

Opinion of OceanFirst’s Financial Advisor

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated June 5, 2017, the OceanFirst board engaged Piper as financial advisor to OceanFirst in
connection with OceanFirst’s consideration of a possible business combination involving OceanFirst and Sun. Piper is a nationally
recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the proposed Transactions and is familiar
with OceanFirst and its business. As part of its investment banking business, Piper is routinely engaged in the valuation of financial
services companies and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. The Piper written opinion, dated June 29, 2017, is
sometimes referred to in this section as the “Piper opinion.”

Piper acted as financial advisor to OceanFirst in connection with the proposed Transactions and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to the execution of the merger agreement. At the meeting of the OceanFirst board held on June 29, 2017, Piper
delivered to the OceanFirst board its oral opinion, followed by delivery of its written opinion, that, as of such date, and based upon and
subject to the various factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in the Piper opinion, the merger consideration to be paid pursuant to
the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to OceanFirst.

The full text of Piper’s written opinion dated June 29, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering the
Piper opinion, is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. Piper’s
opinion speaks only as of the date of the Piper opinion. You are urged to read the Piper opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Piper’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the OceanFirst board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration to OceanFirst from a financial point of view,
and did not address any other aspects or implications of the integrated mergers. The Piper opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to the OceanFirst stockholders or to any other persons in respect of the integrated mergers, including as to
how any holder of OceanFirst common stock should vote at any stockholders’ meeting held in connection with the integrated
mergers or take, or not to take, any action in respect of the integrated mergers. The Piper opinion does not address the relative
merits of the integrated mergers as compared to any other business or financial strategies that might be available to
OceanFirst, nor does it address the underlying business decision of OceanFirst to engage in the integrated mergers. The
issuance of the Piper opinion was approved by the fairness opinion committee of Piper. The summary of the Piper opinion set
forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Piper opinion. Piper has consented to the inclusion of
this summary of the Piper opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

In rendering the Piper opinion, Piper reviewed and analyzed, among other things:
 

 •  the financial terms contained in a draft of the merger agreement dated as of June 29, 2017;
 

 
•  certain financial and other data with respect to OceanFirst and Sun, which was publicly available or made available to Piper

by OceanFirst or Sun;
 

 
•  certain forward-looking information relating to OceanFirst and Sun that was publicly available, as well as which was

furnished to Piper by OceanFirst and Sun, including internally prepared forecasts of expected operating results of OceanFirst
and Sun on a standalone basis;

•  materials detailing the Transactions prepared by OceanFirst, Sun, their respective affiliates, and by their respective legal and
accounting advisors including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and purchase
accounting adjustments expected to result from the integrated mergers (which we refer to in this section as the “Synergies
and Adjustments”);

 

 
•  current and historical reported prices and trading activity of OceanFirst and Sun and similar information for certain other

publicly traded companies deemed by Piper to be comparable to OceanFirst and Sun;
 

 
•  the financial performance of OceanFirst and Sun compared with that of certain other publicly traded companies that Piper

deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain financial analyses for OceanFirst on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the Transaction based on

assumptions relating to the Synergies and Adjustments;
 

 

•  the merger consideration relative to the historical trading price of Sun and Sun’s tangible book value, core deposits (deposits
less all jumbo time deposits), last twelve months earnings, on a core basis, as of March 31, 2017, projected earnings for the
years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and projected earnings for the year ending December 31, 2018
assuming the cost savings to be achieved have been fully phased in as OceanFirst projects;

 

 •  the current market environment generally and the depository banking environment in particular;
 

 
•  the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions in the depository banking

industry that Piper deemed relevant; and
 

 
•  such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as Piper

deemed necessary in arriving at the Piper opinion.

Piper also held several discussions with certain members of senior management and representatives of both OceanFirst and Sun with
respect to certain aspects of the integrated mergers, and the past and current business operations of OceanFirst and Sun, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of OceanFirst and Sun, and certain other matters Piper believed necessary or appropriate
to its inquiry.

In arriving at the Piper opinion, Piper relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent
verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made
available to, or discussed with or reviewed by Piper. Piper further relied upon the assurances of the management of OceanFirst and Sun
that the financial information provided was prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with industry practice, and that they are not
aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to Piper materially incomplete or misleading. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper assumed that with respect to financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking
information (including the Synergies and Adjustments) reviewed by Piper, that such information was reasonably prepared based on
assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of OceanFirst and Sun as to the
expected future results of operations and financial condition of OceanFirst and Sun, respectively, to which such financial forecasts,
estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies and Adjustments) relate and Piper assumed that such results
would be achieved. Piper expressed no opinion as to any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information (including
the Synergies and Adjustments) or the assumptions on which they were based. Piper further assumed that the integrated mergers will
qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. Piper also expressed no opinion as to any of the
legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the integrated mergers and any other transactions contemplated in connection therewith
and have relied, with OceanFirst’s consent, on advice of the outside legal counsel and the independent accountants to OceanFirst, and
on the assumptions of the management of OceanFirst and Sun, as to all accounting, legal, tax and financial reporting matters with
respect to OceanFirst, Sun and the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

In arriving at the Piper opinion, Piper assumed that the executed merger agreement would be in all material respects identical to the
June 29, 2017 draft reviewed by it. Piper relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that:
 

 
•  the representations and warranties of all parties to the merger agreement and all other related documents and instruments that

are referred to therein are true and correct;
 

 
•  each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by

such party;
 

 •  the integrated mergers will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement without amendments thereto; and
 

 
•  all conditions to the consummation of the integrated mergers will be satisfied without waiver by any party of any conditions

or obligations thereunder.

Additionally, Piper assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the integrated mergers will be
obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect OceanFirst and Sun or the contemplated benefits of the integrated mergers.

For purposes of rendering the Piper opinion, Piper did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities
(fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet, or other) of OceanFirst or Sun, and was not furnished or provided with any such
appraisals or valuations, and did not evaluate the solvency of OceanFirst or Sun under any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. Accordingly, Piper expressed no opinion regarding the liquidation value of OceanFirst, Sun or any other
entity. Piper assumed that there was no material change in the respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of OceanFirst or Sun since the date of the most recent financial data made available to Piper. Piper also assumed in all
respects material to its analysis that OceanFirst and Sun would remain as a going concern for all periods relevant to its analysis.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper did not conduct a review of:
 

 •  any individual credit files of OceanFirst or Sun, nor evaluate the adequacy of the loan or lease reserves of OceanFirst or Sun;
 

 
•  any credit mark that may be taken in connection with the integrated mergers, nor evaluate the adequacy of any contemplated

credit mark to be so taken; or
 

 •  the collectability of any asset or the future performance of any loan of OceanFirst or Sun.

Piper also assumed, with OceanFirst’s consent, that the respective allowances for loan and lease losses for both OceanFirst and Sun,
and the credit mark, are adequate to cover any losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined company.
Accordingly, Piper expressed no opinion with respect to these matters.

In addition, Piper did not make any independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted
claims or other contingent liabilities to which OceanFirst or Sun is a party or may be subject, and at the direction of OceanFirst and
with its consent, Piper’s opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of claims,
outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. Piper also assumed that neither OceanFirst nor Sun is party to any material
pending transaction, including without limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other
than the Transactions.

The Piper opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions and upon the information made available to Piper and
facts and circumstances as they exist and are subject to evaluation as of the date of the Piper opinion. It should be understood that
events occurring after the date of the Piper opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the Piper opinion. Further,
Piper expressed no opinion as to the price at which shares of the common stock of OceanFirst or Sun may trade following
announcement of the integrated mergers or at any future time.

The Piper opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to OceanFirst of the merger consideration set forth in
the merger agreement and does not address any other terms or agreement relating to the integrated mergers. Piper was not requested to
opine as to, and the Piper opinion does not address, (i) the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the integrated mergers;
(ii) the merits of the integrated mergers relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to OceanFirst;
(iii) any other terms contemplated by the merger agreement; or (iv) the fairness of the integrated mergers to, or any consideration
received in connection therewith by, any creditor or other constituency of OceanFirst. Furthermore, Piper expressed no opinion with
respect to the amount or nature of compensation to be paid in the integrated mergers to any officer, director or employee of any party to
the integrated mergers, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be paid to any other shareholder in the
integrated mergers or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation, including whether such payments are reasonable in the
context of the integrated mergers.

In performing its analyses, Piper made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of Piper, OceanFirst and Sun. Any estimates contained
in the analyses performed by Piper are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be more or less favorable
than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently
subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the Piper opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the OceanFirst
board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The type and amount of consideration payable in the integrated
mergers were determined solely through negotiation between OceanFirst and Sun, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement
was solely that of the OceanFirst board.

Piper’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on June 29, 2017, the date of the Piper
opinion, and the information made available to Piper through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of Piper’s opinion may
have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in Piper’s opinion, and Piper did not and does not have an obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm the Piper opinion.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed and presented by Piper to the OceanFirst board on June 29,
2017 in connection with the Piper opinion. Each analysis was provided to the OceanFirst board. The following summary, however,
does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed and reviewed by Piper underlying the Piper opinion or the
presentation made by Piper to the OceanFirst board on June 29, 2017, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented
in connection with such opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations
as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances. A fairness opinion is thus not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at the Piper opinion,
Piper did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.

The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Accordingly, Piper believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular
format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a potentially misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. Also, no company or transaction used in Piper’s analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to
OceanFirst and Sun or the integrated mergers. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not mathematical; rather, it
involves complex considerations and judgments about differences in the companies and transactions to which OceanFirst and Sun and
the integrated mergers were compared and other factors that could

affect the public trading value or transaction value of the companies and the transactions to which they are being compared. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that
existed on or before June 28, 2017, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Summary of Proposal. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Sun common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive either: (a) the cash consideration, which is an amount
in cash equal to the sum of (i) $3.78 plus (ii) 0.7884 multiplied by the OceanFirst closing price or (b) the stock consideration, which
will be a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the exchange ratio, which is the quotient of (A) the cash consideration
divided by (B) the OceanFirst closing price. The right to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration will be made at the
election of each holder of Sun common stock, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. Based on
OceanFirst’s closing price on June 28, 2017 of $27.15, the merger consideration had an implied value of $25.18 per share of Sun
common stock at that date. Based on this deemed value per share to Sun shareholders and based upon 19,060,593 shares of common
stock outstanding, 127,808 unvested restricted stock units, and 556,694 options to purchase shares of Sun common stock outstanding
converted into options to purchase shares of OceanFirst common stock, the aggregate merger consideration was approximately
$484.9 million on June 28, 2017.

Comparable Transaction Analysis. Piper reviewed certain publicly available information related to twelve selected acquisitions of
banks and bank holding companies as well as thrifts and thrift holding companies with headquarters in the Mid-Atlantic and New
England announced after January 1, 2014, where deal value was available and the buyer was a bank or bank holding company or a
thrift or thrift holding company, the seller was not an MHC and had total assets between $1.0 billion and $6.0 billion, a last twelve
months return on average assets between 0.00% and 1.00%, and a nonperforming assets to assets ratio less than 3.0%. The transactions
included in the group were:
 
Acquiror   Acquiree
Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.   Commerce Bancshares Corp.
Community Bank System, Inc.   Merchants Bancshares, Inc.
OceanFirst Financial Corp.   Ocean Shore Holding Co.

Transaction multiples for the integrated mergers were derived based on an offer price of $25.18 per share for Sun based on
OceanFirst’s June 28, 2017 closing price of $27.15. For each precedent transaction, Piper derived and compared, among other things,
the implied ratio of price per common share paid for the acquired company to:
 

 
•  tangible book value per share of the acquired company based on the latest financial statements of the company available

prior to the announcement of the acquisition;
 

 
•  tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less jumbo time deposits) based on the latest financial statements of

the company available prior to the announcement of the acquisition;
 

 
•  the last twelve months earnings per share based on the latest financial statements of the company available prior to the

announcement of the acquisition;
 

 
•  the current year earnings per share estimate of the acquired company, if available, from SNL Financial, a nationally

recognized earnings estimate consolidator;
 

 
•  the forward year earnings per share estimate of the acquired company, if available, from SNL Financial, a nationally

recognized earnings estimate consolidator; and
 

 •  the stock price of the acquired company as of market close the day before the announcement of the acquisition.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Piper performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of the present values of after-tax
cash flows that OceanFirst could provide to equity holders through the year ending December 31, 2022 on a stand-alone basis and on a
pro forma basis giving effect to the integrated mergers. In performing this analysis, Piper used publicly available analyst earnings
estimates provided by Bloomberg Finance L.P. for OceanFirst for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, with
estimated earnings thereafter through the year ending December 31, 2023 grown by 8.0% annually as provided by OceanFirst senior
management. The analysis assumed discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%, which were assumed deviations, both up and down,
as selected by Piper based on a discount rate of 12.1% as determined by Piper. The range of values for the discounted cash flow
analysis was determined by adding (1) the present value of projected cash flows available to OceanFirst’s stockholders from the year
ending December 31, 2017 to the year ending December 31, 2022 and (2) the present value of the terminal value of OceanFirst’s
common stock. In determining cash flows available to OceanFirst stockholders, Piper assumed that OceanFirst would maintain a
tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.0% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain these levels. Any earnings in
excess of what would need to be retained were assumed to be distributed as dividends to OceanFirst stockholders. In calculating the
terminal value of OceanFirst, Piper applied terminal multiples ranging from 14.0 times to 16.0 times the year ending December 31,
2023 estimated earnings. This resulted in a range of values of OceanFirst on a stand-alone basis from $26.20 to $31.51 per share and
on a pro forma basis from $27.00 to $32.35 per share.

Piper also performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of the present values of after-tax cash flows that Sun could
provide to equity holders through the year ending December 31, 2022 on a stand-alone basis. In performing this analysis, Piper used
publicly available analyst earnings estimates provided by Bloomberg Finance L.P. for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017,
December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019 with estimated earnings thereafter through the year ending December 31, 2023 grown by
8.0% annually as provided by OceanFirst senior management. The analysis assumed discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0%,
which were assumed deviations, both up and down, as selected by Piper based on a discount rate of 13.0% as determined by Piper. The
range of values for the discounted cash flow analysis was determined by adding (1) the present value of projected cash flows available
to Sun’s stockholders from the year ending December 31, 2017 to the year ending December 31, 2022 and (2) the present value of the
terminal value of Sun’s common stock. In determining cash flows available to Sun stockholders, Piper assumed that Sun would
maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.0% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain these levels. Any
earnings in excess of what would need to be retained were assumed to be distributed as dividends to Sun stockholders. In calculating
the terminal value of Sun, Piper applied terminal multiples ranging from 14.0 times to 16.0 times the year ending December 31, 2023
estimated earnings. This analysis resulted in a range of values of Sun from $12.11 to $13.61 per share.

Piper also performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Sun common stock on a pro forma basis assuming
that Sun performed in accordance with publicly available research analyst estimates, inclusive of estimated synergies associated with
the integrated mergers. Piper utilized the same methodology as

described in the Sun stand-alone discounted cash flow analysis. The analysis assumed discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0%,
which were assumed deviations, both up and down, as selected by Piper based on a discount rate of 13.0% as determined by Piper. In
calculating the terminal value of Sun, Piper applied terminal multiples ranging from 14.0 times to 16.0 times the year ending
December 31, 2023 estimated earnings. This analysis resulted in a range of values of Sun from $25.45 to $29.65 per share.

Piper stated that the discounted cash flow present value analysis is a widely used valuation methodology but noted that it relies on
numerous assumptions, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. The analysis did not purport to be
indicative of the actual values or expected values of Sun and OceanFirst.

Relative Contribution Analysis. Piper analyzed the relative contribution of OceanFirst and Sun to the pro forma market capitalization,
balance sheet and income statement items of the combined entity, including pro forma market capitalization, assets, net loans, deposits,
tangible common equity, analyst research estimated net income for the year ending December 31, 2018, and analyst research estimated
net income for the year ending December 31, 2018 if cost savings, provided by OceanFirst senior management, were to be fully
phased-in. This analysis excluded all purchase accounting adjustments and was based on the closing prices of OceanFirst and Sun
common stock on June 28, 2017 of $27.15 and $24.65, respectively. Piper compared the various contribution percentages, including the
average and median percentages, to the pro forma equity ownership assuming 85% stock consideration and 100% stock consideration.
 

   Contribution  
   OceanFirst  Sun  
Market Capitalization    65.2%   34.8% 
Assets    70.1%   29.9% 
Net Loans    70.6%   29.4% 
Deposits    70.8%   29.2% 
Tangible Common Equity    59.9%   40.1% 
Estimated 2018 Full Year Net Income    85.8%   14.2% 
Estimated 2018 Full Year Net Income w/ Fully Phased-In Cost Savings    64.9%   35.1% 

Average    70.4%   29.6% 

Median    70.3%   29.7% 
Pro Forma Equity Ownership (At 85% Stock Consideration)    68.1%   31.9% 
Pro Forma Equity Ownership (At 100% Stock Consideration)    64.3%   35.7% 

Financial Impact Analysis. Piper performed pro forma merger analyses that combined projected income statement and balance sheet
information of OceanFirst and Sun. Assumptions regarding the accounting treatment, acquisition adjustments, related expenses and
cost savings were used to calculate the financial impact that the integrated mergers would have on certain projected financial results of
OceanFirst. In the course of this analysis, Piper used publicly available analyst earnings estimates provided by Bloomberg Finance L.P.
for Sun for the years ending December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019 with estimated earnings thereafter
grown by 8.0% annually as provided by OceanFirst senior management and for OceanFirst used publicly available analyst earnings
estimates provided by Bloomberg Finance L.P. for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 with estimated
earnings thereafter grown by 8.0% annually as provided by OceanFirst senior management. This analysis indicated that the integrated
mergers would be accretive to OceanFirst’s estimated earnings per share in the year ending December 31, 2019 (the first year of fully
phased-in cost savings). The analysis also indicated that the integrated mergers would be 1.3% dilutive to tangible book value per share
for OceanFirst with an earnback of approximately 3.6 years. Additionally, OceanFirst is assumed to maintain well-capitalized ratios per
regulatory guidelines. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by OceanFirst following the integrated mergers may
vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Other Analyses. Among other things, Piper reviewed balance sheet composition and other financial data for OceanFirst and Sun. With
respect to OceanFirst and Sun’s public price, Piper reviewed the public price targets of four research analysts covering OceanFirst as
provided by Bloomberg Finance L.P., a nationally recognized research price target consolidator, which ranged from $29.00 to $34.00
per share. Piper also reviewed the public price target of two research analyst covering Sun as provided by Bloomberg Finance L.P.,
which were $27.00 and $28.00 per share. Piper also reviewed the historical trading performances of shares of OceanFirst and Sun’s
common stock during the 52-week period ended June 28, 2017. OceanFirst’s common stock traded as low as $17.57 per share and as
high as $30.70 per share, and the closing price of OceanFirst’s common stock on June 28, 2017 was $27.15 per share. Sun’s common
stock traded as low as $20.35 per share and as high as $26.80 per share, and the closing price of Sun’s common stock on June 28, 2017
was $24.65 per share.

Piper’s Compensation and Other Relationships with OceanFirst. OceanFirst and Piper entered into an engagement letter dated June 5,
2017 relating to the services to be provided by Piper in connection with the integrated mergers. Pursuant to the engagement letter,
OceanFirst agreed to pay Piper (a) a fee of $300,000 upon the delivery to the OceanFirst board of the written Piper opinion, which fee
will be credited in full against the transaction fee; and (b) contingent upon closing of the integrated mergers, a transaction fee of
$2,500,000. Pursuant to the Piper engagement letter, OceanFirst also agreed to reimburse Piper for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
and disbursements incurred in connection with its retention. OceanFirst has also agreed to indemnify Piper against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

The Piper investment banking team that advised OceanFirst in connection with the integrated mergers also advised OceanFirst in
connection with OceanFirst’s acquisition of Ocean Shore Holding Co., which closed in November 2016. The Piper investment banking
team also advised OceanFirst (while at a prior firm) in connection with the Colonial American acquisition, which closed in July 2015.
Piper has not provided any other material investment banking or financial advisory services to OceanFirst, Sun or their respective
affiliates during the past two years; however, Piper may do so in the future, for which it would expect to receive compensation. In the
ordinary course of Piper’s business as a broker-dealer, Piper may, from time to time, purchase securities from and sell securities to
OceanFirst, Sun or their affiliates.

Interests of Sun’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions

In considering the recommendation of the Sun board, Sun shareholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Sun
have certain interests in the Transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Sun shareholders generally. The
Sun board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation that Sun shareholders
vote to approve the Sun merger proposal. These interests are described in further detail below.

Treatment of Sun Equity Awards

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock award granted by Sun will become fully vested, and each holder of
such restricted stock awards will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive the cash
consideration or the stock consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such awards, subject to the
allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock unit award granted by Sun will be cancelled, and each holder
of such restricted stock unit awards will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive the
cash consideration or the stock consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such awards, subject to
the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Stock Options: At the effective time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Sun common stock will be converted into an
option to purchase a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Sun common stock subject to such Sun stock option immediately prior to the effective time by
(ii) the exchange ratio; and the exercise price per share of the new option will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the per
share exercise price for each share of Sun common stock subject to such Sun option by (b) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent).

Any Sun equity awards that do not vest as of the effective time would be eligible for accelerated vesting upon the holder’s termination
of employment without cause, due to death or disability or, in the case of the executive officers, resignation for good reason.

For an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each of Sun’s named executive officers upon the vesting and settlement
of their unvested equity awards, see “— Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Sun’s Named Executive Officers” below. Sun
estimates, based on an assumed effective time of August 15, 2017 and a price per share of Sun common stock of $24.72 (the average
closing price of shares of Sun common stock on the five business days following the announcement of the Transactions), that the
aggregate amount that would become payable to its three executive officers who are not named executive officers in settlement of their
unvested equity awards if each experienced a qualifying termination of employment immediately following the effective time would be
$582,320, and the aggregate amount that would become payable to its nine non-employee directors (excluding Chair Anthony Coscia,
who does not hold unvested equity awards) in settlement of their unvested equity awards would be $318,146.

Change in Control Continuity Arrangements

Sun is party to change in control continuity agreements with each of its executive officers, which agreements provide certain severance
benefits upon a change in control of Sun (such as the integrated mergers) or a qualifying termination of employment thereafter. If the
employment of an executive officer of Sun were terminated by Sun without cause or by the executive officer for good reason within
two years following the effective time, the executive officer would be entitled to the following:
 

 
•  Prorated Annual Incentive. A cash payment equal to the executive officer’s target annual incentive opportunity, prorated for

the portion of the year elapsed as of the termination date, which amount would be payable in a lump sum within thirty days
following the date of termination;

 

 

•  Severance Payment. A cash severance payment equal to the product of (a) a severance multiple of either three (for Messrs.
O’Brien, Brugger, Katsoulis and Morris and Mss. Estep and Schaubeck) or one (for all other executive officers), multiplied
by (b) the sum of the executive officer’s annual base salary plus highest annual incentive earned or payable over a multi-year
period preceding the change in control, which amount would be payable in a lump sum within 30 days following the date of
termination;

 

 
•  Retirement Benefits Payment. A cash payment in lieu of employer retirement plan contributions that would have been made

during the number of years following the date of termination equal to the severance multiple, which amount would be
payable in a lump sum within thirty days following the date of termination;

 

 
•  Welfare Benefits Payment. A cash payment equal to 125% of the expected cost of premiums for coverage under Sun’s

welfare plans for the number of years following the date of termination equal to the severance multiple, which amount
would be payable in a lump sum within thirty days following the date of termination; and

 

 
•  Equity Awards. Vesting of any unvested equity awards. In addition, upon a change in control, Mr. O’Brien would be entitled

to automatic vesting of any unvested equity compensation awards, regardless of whether his employment terminates.

Table of Contents

None of the executive officers are eligible for a gross-up in respect of excise taxes that might be incurred under Section 4999 of the
Code. Instead, the change in control continuity agreements provide that any payments thereunder would be reduced to the extent
necessary to avoid an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, except that in the case of Mr. O’Brien, such reduction would apply
only to the extent that it would result in a greater after-tax benefit to him. Prior to the effective time, Sun may take certain actions to
mitigate the impact of Section 4999 of the Code, including if Sun reasonably determines that the effective time will occur after
December 31, 2017, accelerating into 2017 the vesting or payment of compensation or benefits that are scheduled to be paid either in
2018 or upon the effective time, or paying out accrued paid time off or sick leave.

The change in control continuity agreements subject the applicable executive officer to a confidentiality covenant, while all other
restrictive covenants applicable to the executive officer would lapse upon the change in control.

For an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each of Sun’s named executive officers under his or her change in control
continuity agreement if a severance-qualifying termination of employment were to occur immediately following consummation of the
integrated mergers, see “— Quantification of Potential Payments to Sun’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Transactions.” Sun estimates that the aggregate value of the prorated annual incentive, severance payment, retirement benefits payment
and welfare benefits payment that would become payable to Sun’s three other executive officers under their change in control
continuity agreements if the effective time were August 15, 2017, and each incurred a severance-qualifying termination of employment
on that date, to be $1,934,534.

Prorated Annual Incentive

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the effective time occurs prior to the end of 2017, within five days prior to the
effective time, Sun may pay annual incentive awards to eligible employees (including the executive officers) in an amount determined
based on the greater of target and actual and forecasted performance as of the completion of the effective time and prorated based on
the portion of the year elapsed as of that time. In addition, if the effective time occurs after March 1, 2018, Sun may pay prorated
annual incentive awards in respect of 2018 on the same terms as the prorated annual incentive awards in respect of 2017. Because the
values included in this section assume that each of the executive officers would experience a termination of employment during 2017 at
the effective time and each would receive a prorated annual incentive under his or her change in control continuity agreement, no value
is attributed to the prorated annual incentive payable under the merger agreement.

Post-Closing Roles

As noted above, two current members of the Sun board would be appointed to the OceanFirst board and the board of directors of
OceanFirst bank at the effective time.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the effective time, each of OceanFirst and the combined company would
indemnify certain persons, including Sun’s directors and executive officers. In addition, for a period of not less than six years from the
effective time, OceanFirst would maintain an insurance policy for the benefit of certain persons, including Sun’s directors and
executive officers. For a more detailed description of these covenants and agreements, see “The Merger Agreement — Director and
Officer Indemnification and Insurance.”

Quantification of Potential Payments to Sun’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transactions

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of Sun’s named

executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Transactions and assumes, among other things, that each of Sun’s named
executive officers is terminated without cause immediately following the effective time. The amounts indicated below are estimates
based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including assumptions described
below, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the effective time. For purposes of calculating such
amounts, we have assumed:
 

 •  August 15, 2017 as the closing date of the integrated mergers; and
 

 
•  Each named executive officer experiences a severance-qualifying termination of employment immediately following the

effective time.

(1) The cash amount, which would be payable to each named executive officer in a lump sum within 30 days following the date of termination, consists of the following components:
 (a) An amount equal to the named executive officer’s target annual incentive opportunity, prorated for the portion of the year elapsed as of the termination date;
 (b) An amount equal to the product of (i) three, multiplied by (ii) the sum of the named executive officer’s annual base salary plus highest annual incentive earned or payable over amulti-year period preceding the effective time;
 (c) An amount in lieu of employer retirement plan contributions that would have been made during the three years following the date of termination; and
 (d) An amount equal to 125% of the expected cost of premiums for coverage under Sun’s welfare plans for three years following the date of termination

All components of such cash amount are “double-trigger” (i.e., they are contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment). The estimated amount of each component of the cash

If the effective time occurs prior to the end of 2017, within five days prior to the effective time, Sun may pay annual incentive awards to eligible employees (including the executive
officers) in an amount determined based on the greater of target and actual and forecasted performance as of the completion of the effective time and prorated based on the portion of the
year elapsed as of that time. In addition, if the effective time occurs after March 1, 2018, Sun may pay prorated annual incentive awards in respect of 2018 on the same terms as the
prorated annual incentive awards in respect of 2017. Because the values included in this table assume that each of the named executive officers would experience a termination of
employment during 2017 at the effective time and each would receive a prorated annual incentive under his or her change in control continuity agreement, no value is attributed to the
prorated annual incentive payable under the merger agreement.

 
(2) As described in more detail in “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Sun Equity-Based Awards,” (a) each outstanding stock option to purchase Sun common stock would convert at the

effective time into an option to purchase a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock and (b) each outstanding Sun restricted stock award or restricted stock unit would vest “single-
trigger” at the effective time and would convert into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock subject thereto. Any unvested stock
options that are held by Mr. O’Brien would vest single-trigger at the effective time, while those held by the other named executive officers would vest “double-trigger” upon a qualifying
termination of employment thereafter.

The amounts above and in the table below assume a price per share of Sun common stock of $24.72 (the average closing price of shares of Sun common stock on the five business days
following the announcement of the Transactions). Set forth below are the values of each type of unvested Sun equity award held by the named executive officers that would become vested

(3) The total amount does not take into account any reduction to avoid an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. None of the executive officers are eligible for a gross-up in respect of

excise taxes that might be incurred under Section 4999 of the Code. Instead, any payments would be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code,
except that in the case of Mr. O’Brien, such reduction would apply only to the extent that it would result in a greater after-tax benefit to him. Based on the assumptions described above, the
payments to the named executive officers of Sun would be reduced by the following amounts: Mr. O’Brien: $693,845; Mr. Brugger: $520,999; Mr. Katsoulis: $570,165; Mr. Morris:
$579,119; and Ms. Schaubeck: $512,760. Prior to the effective time, Sun may take certain actions to mitigate the impact of Section 4999 of the Code, including if Sun reasonably
determines that the effective time will occur after December 31, 2017, accelerating into 2017 the vesting or payment of compensation or benefits that are scheduled to be paid either in
2018 or upon the effective time, or paying out accrued paid time off or sick leave.

Public Trading Markets

OceanFirst common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol “OCFC” and Sun common stock is listed on the
NASDAQ under the symbol “SNBC.” Upon completion of the first-step merger, Sun common stock will no longer be listed on the
NASDAQ and will be de-registered under the Exchange Act. It is a condition to each party’s obligations to complete the integrated
mergers that the OceanFirst common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement be authorized for listing on the NASDAQ
(subject to official notice of issuance). Immediately following the completion of the Transactions, shares of OceanFirst common stock
will continue to be traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “OCFC.”

Dividend Policy

OceanFirst currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which is expected to continue, although the OceanFirst board
may change this dividend policy at any time. Sun currently pays quarterly cash dividends of $0.01 per share, which is expected to
continue until the effective time, although, subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, the Sun board may change this
dividend policy at any time. OceanFirst stockholders will be entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the OceanFirst board
out of funds legally available for dividends. The OceanFirst board will consider OceanFirst’s financial condition and level of net
income, future prospects, economic condition, industry practices and other factors, including applicable banking laws and regulations,
in determining whether to pay dividends in the future and the amount of such dividends.

OceanFirst’s principal source of income is dividends that are declared and paid by OceanFirst Bank on its capital stock. Therefore,
OceanFirst’s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from OceanFirst Bank. Insured depository institutions
such as OceanFirst Bank are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such
distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized,” as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations. In the
future, any declaration and payment of cash dividends will be subject to the OceanFirst board’s evaluation of OceanFirst’s operating
results, financial condition, future growth plans, general business and economic conditions, and tax and other relevant considerations.
The payment of cash dividends by OceanFirst in the future will also be subject to certain other legal and regulatory limitations and
ongoing review by the OceanFirst’s banking regulators.

Table of Contents

No Dissenters’ Rights

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value of their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. New Jersey law
provides that a stockholder is not entitled to demand the fair value of his or her shares of stock in any transaction if, among other
things, the stock is listed on a national securities exchange, if cash is to be received or the securities to be received are listed on a
national securities exchange. Because Sun’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, the holders of Sun common stock are not
entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the first-step merger.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transactions

Completion of the Transactions is subject to receipt of certain approvals, waivers and consents from applicable governmental and
regulatory authorities, without certain conditions being imposed by any governmental authority as part of a regulatory approval that
would reasonably be expected to result in a materially burdensome regulatory condition. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement, OceanFirst and Sun have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts and cooperate to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation and to obtain as promptly as practicable all regulatory approvals necessary or advisable to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These include, among others, approval from the Federal Reserve Board and the
OCC. OceanFirst submitted the FRB application and the OCC application on September 1, 2017. As of the date of this joint
proxy/statement prospectus, each of the FRB application and the OCC application remain outstanding. Although OceanFirst knows of
no reason why the FRB application or the OCC application should not be approved in a timely manner, OceanFirst cannot be certain
when, or if, the FRB application and the OCC application will be approved.

Federal Reserve Board

OceanFirst Bank is currently a federal savings association, and OceanFirst is currently a savings and loan holding company regulated
and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board under the HOLA. Prior to the completion of the Transactions, OceanFirst Bank intends to
convert from a federal savings association into a national banking association, and OceanFirst intends to cease being a savings and loan
holding company and become a bank holding company. OceanFirst Bank’s conversion to a national banking association is subject to
approval of the OCC, and OceanFirst becoming a bank holding company is subject to approval of the Federal Reserve Board. As a
bank holding company, OceanFirst would be regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA.

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including OceanFirst becoming a bank holding company, require prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. In evaluating an application for such approval, the Federal Reserve Board
takes into consideration a number of factors, including (i) the competitive impact of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets,
(ii) financial, managerial and other supervisory considerations, including financial condition, future prospects, capital positions,
managerial resources, and compliance with applicable banking, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering laws,
(iii) convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the record of the insured depository institution subsidiaries of the
companies under the CRA, (iv) effectiveness of the companies and the depository institutions concerned in combating money
laundering activities, (v) availability of information needed to determine and enforce compliance with the BHCA and other applicable
federal banking laws and (vi) extent to which the proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the
United States banking or financial system. The Federal Reserve will provide an opportunity for public comment on the application and
is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if it determines such meeting or other proceeding would be appropriate.

Table of Contents

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

OceanFirst Bank is an insured depository institution regulated and supervised by the OCC. The merger of Sun National Bank with and
into OceanFirst Bank requires prior approval of the OCC under the Bank Merger Act. In evaluating an application for such approval,
the OCC takes into consideration a number of factors, including (i) the competitive impact of the transaction; (ii) financial and
managerial resources of the bank parties to the bank merger or integrated mergers both on a current and pro forma basis; (iii) the
convenience and needs of the community to be served and the record of the banks under the CRA, including their CRA ratings; (iv) the
banks’ effectiveness in combating money laundering activities; and (v) the extent to which the bank merger or integrated mergers
would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review,
the OCC provides an opportunity for public comment on the application and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding
if it determines that would be appropriate. In addition, subject to approval from the OCC, prior to the completion of the Transactions,
OceanFirst Bank intends to convert from a federal savings association into a national banking association. In evaluating an application
for conversion to a national banking association by another financial institution, the OCC will assess, among other things, whether the
institution can operate safely and soundly as a national banking association in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and
policies.

Additional Regulatory Approvals and Notices

OceanFirst and Sun believe that the Transactions do not raise substantial antitrust or other significant regulatory concerns and that the
parties to the Transactions will be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals. However, neither OceanFirst nor Sun can assure you
that all of the regulatory approvals described above will be obtained and, if obtained, OceanFirst and Sun cannot assure you as to the
timing of any such approvals, their ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging
such approvals. In addition, there can be no assurance that such approvals will not impose conditions or requirements that, individually
or in the aggregate, would or could reasonably be expected to have a materially burdensome regulatory condition.

Neither OceanFirst nor Sun is aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required for completion of the
Transactions other than those described above. It is presently contemplated that if any such additional governmental approvals or
actions are required, those approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or
actions will be obtained.

Litigation Related to the Transactions

On July 18, 2017, three purported Sun shareholders filed putative shareholder class action lawsuits against Sun, the members of the
Sun board, OceanFirst and Merger Sub in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Burlington County, Chancery Division, captioned Bruce
Oswald v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000070 17; Robert Rumsey v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000071 17;
and Paul D. Chetcuti v. Sun Bancorp, Inc., et al., Docket No. C 000072 17. The actions generally allege that members of the Sun board
breached their fiduciary duties by approving the merger agreement because the transaction is procedurally flawed and financially
inadequate. Plaintiffs further allege that OceanFirst and Merger Sub aided and abetted such alleged breaches. The actions seek to enjoin
the Transactions, as well as unspecified money damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and expense. On July 31, 2017, the plaintiffs in such
class action lawsuits filed a motion to consolidate all three actions, and for the appointment of interim lead counsel. On August 28,
2017, the court granted the motion to consolidate, consolidating all three actions under the caption In re Sun Bancorp, Inc.
Consolidated Stockholder Litigation, Docket No. C-70-17. Plaintiffs’ motion for the appointment of interim lead counsel was denied
without prejudice. On August 28, 2017, the Consolidated Action was transferred to the Honorable John E. Harrington, P.J. Civ. as
Burlington County’s designated Complex Business Litigation Judge. On September 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action
Complaint in the Consolidated Action, which also alleges that the Sun board breached their fiduciary duties in failing to disclose
material information about the transaction. Also on September 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery and a
supporting memorandum of law.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following description of the merger agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the express terms of the
merger agreement, which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document
governing the integrated mergers.

Structure of the Transactions

The Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger

Each of the OceanFirst board and the Sun board has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides for
(i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into Sun, with Sun continuing as the surviving corporation in the first-step merger and as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of OceanFirst, (ii) immediately following the completion of the first-step merger, Sun will merge with and
into OceanFirst, with OceanFirst continuing as the surviving corporation in the second-step merger and (iii) immediately following the
completion of the integrated mergers, Sun National Bank will merge with and into OceanFirst Bank, a wholly owned bank subsidiary
of OceanFirst, with OceanFirst Bank continuing as the surviving bank in the bank merger.

Merger Consideration

On the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Sun common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the first-step merger, except for specified shares of Sun common stock owned by
Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the Sun shareholders, either the cash consideration or
the stock consideration, subject to the allocation and proration procedures of the merger agreement, in each case, as described in more
detail below.

Cash Consideration

The merger agreement provides that each share of Sun common stock for which a valid cash election has been made will be converted
into the right to receive, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, an amount in cash equal to the sum
of (i) $3.78 plus (ii) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by the OceanFirst share closing price. The merger agreement provides that the
aggregate amount of cash consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78 and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.

Stock Consideration

The merger agreement provides that each share of Sun common stock for which a valid stock election has been made will be converted
into the right to receive, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement, a number of shares of OceanFirst
common stock equal to the exchange ratio, which is calculated as the quotient of (A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the
OceanFirst share closing price. Holders of Sun common stock will have the right to elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock
consideration, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

If the outstanding shares of OceanFirst common stock or Sun common stock are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or if there is any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate
and proportionate adjustment will be made to the merger consideration to give holders of Sun common stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by the merger agreement prior to such event.

OceanFirst will not issue any fractional shares of OceanFirst common stock in the first-step merger. Instead, any Sun shareholder who
otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of OceanFirst common stock will instead be entitled to receive an
amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) of OceanFirst common stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive by
(ii) OceanFirst share closing price.

Non-Election Shares

The merger agreement provides that each share of Sun common stock (other than shares for which a valid election of either cash
consideration or stock consideration has been effectively made and not revoked, in each case, pursuant to the election procedures of the
merger agreement, as described below) will be treated as a “non-election share” and will, at the effective time, be converted into the
right to receive such stock consideration or cash consideration as determined in accordance with the proration and allocation provisions
of the merger agreement, as described below. That is, if a Sun shareholder does not make a proper election in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement, then such election will be deemed to be not in effect and the shares of Sun common stock covered by
such invalid election will, for purposes of the merger agreement, be deemed non-election shares unless a proper election is
subsequently made within the election period, as described below. None of OceanFirst, Sun or the exchange agent are or will be under
any duty to notify any Sun shareholder of any defective election.

Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration

The total number of shares of Sun common stock to be entitled to receive the cash consideration will be equal to the quotient of (i) the
cash component divided by (ii) the per share cash consideration, which is equal to the sum, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent,
of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, of 0.7884 multiplied by the OceanFirst share closing price
(we refer to this quotient as the “cash conversion number”). All other shares of Sun common stock (excluding certain shares of Sun
common stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst or any of their respective subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive the stock
consideration.

Promptly after the effective time, and in no event later than five business days thereafter, OceanFirst will cause the exchange agent to
effect the allocation among holders of Sun common stock of right to receive the cash consideration and the stock consideration, as
described below:

Oversubscription of Cash Consideration:

Shares of OceanFirst common stock may be issued to Sun shareholders who make cash elections if the aggregate number of shares of
Sun common stock with respect to which a cash election has been made exceeds the cash conversion number. If the cash consideration
is oversubscribed, then:
 

 •  All stock election shares and all non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration; and
 

 

•  A Sun shareholder who made a cash election will have the right to receive (a) the cash consideration for a number of shares
of Sun common stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Sun common stock for which
such holder has made a cash election by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the cash conversion number and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of Sun common stock with respect to which a cash election has
been made and (b) the stock consideration for the remaining shares of Sun common stock for which the Sun shareholder
made a cash election.

Table of Contents

Undersubscription of Cash Consideration:

Cash may be issued to Sun shareholders who make stock elections and/or to non-election shares if the number of cash election shares is
less than the cash conversion number (we refer to the amount by which the number of cash election shares is less than the cash
conversion number as the “shortfall number”). If the cash consideration is undersubscribed, then all cash election shares will be
converted into the right to receive the cash consideration. Sun shareholders who make a stock election, as well as non-election shares,
will have the right to receive cash and/or shares of OceanFirst common stock based in part on whether the shortfall number is less or
greater than the number of non-election shares, as described below.
 

 

•  If the shortfall number is less than or equal to the number of non-election shares, then (a) all stock election shares will be
converted into the right to receive the stock consideration and (b) the non-election shares will be converted into the right to
receive (i) the cash consideration for the number of non-election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
number of non-election shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall number and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of non-election shares and (ii) the stock consideration for the remaining
number of such holder’s non-election shares.

 

 

•  If the shortfall number exceeds the number of non-election shares, then (a) all non-election shares will be converted into the
right to receive the cash consideration and (b) stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive (i) the cash
consideration in respect of that number of stock election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number
of stock election shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the shortfall
number exceeds the aggregate number of non-election shares, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
shares of Sun common stock with respect to which a stock election has been made and (ii) the stock consideration for the
remaining number of such holder’s stock election shares.

Election Procedures; Exchange of Shares

Election Procedures

Each Sun shareholder of record may specify (i) the number of shares of Sun common stock owned by such holder with respect to
which such Sun shareholder desires to make a stock election and (ii) the number of shares of Sun common stock owned by such holder
with respect to which such Sun shareholder desires to make a cash election. At any time during the election period (as described in
more detail below), each Sun shareholder may change or revoke such Sun shareholder’s election by written notice to the exchange
agent prior to the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised form of election.

Additionally, each Sun shareholder may, at any time during the election period, revoke his, her or its election by written notice received
by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of his, her or its old certificates, or
of the guarantee of delivery of such old certificates, previously deposited with the exchange agent. All elections will be automatically
deemed revoked upon receipt by the exchange agent of written notification from the parties that the merger agreement has been
terminated in accordance with the terms thereof.

Under the merger agreement, OceanFirst has agreed to prepare an election form reasonably acceptable to Sun, including appropriate
and customary transmittal materials, so as to permit Sun shareholders of record to exercise their right to make an election. OceanFirst
will initially make available and mail the form of election not less than twenty business days prior to the anticipated election deadline
to Sun shareholders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing date. Following such mailing date, OceanFirst will use all
reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a form of election to any Sun shareholder who requests such form of
election prior to the election deadline. The election deadline is expected to be 5:00 p.m. local time (determined as the city in which the
principal office of the exchange agent is located) on the date OceanFirst and Sun agree is as near as practicable to two business days
before the closing date.

Table of Contents

Any election will have been made properly only if the exchange agent receives a duly completed and signed election form (including
duly executed transmittal materials included in the form of election) during the election period. In order for an election form to be duly
delivered to the exchange agent during the election period, the election form must be accompanied by any old certificates representing
all certificated shares to which such form of election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such old
certificates, as set forth in such form of election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or
trust company in the United States.

Sun and OceanFirst have agreed to cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the
election deadline not more than fifteen business days before, and at least five business days prior to, the election deadline.

Subject to the terms of the merger agreement and the form of election, OceanFirst, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith
discretion, has the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of the merger agreement, governing (i) the validity
of the forms of election and compliance by any holder with the election procedures set forth therein, (ii) the method of issuance and
delivery of new certificates representing the whole number of shares of OceanFirst common stock into which shares of Sun common
stock are converted in the merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Sun common stock converted into the right to
receive the cash consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of OceanFirst common stock.

Letter of Transmittal

As promptly as practicable after the effective time, and in no event later than five business days thereafter, the exchange agent will mail
or otherwise deliver to each holder of record of shares of Sun common stock immediately prior to the effective time that have been
converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to
surrender shares of Sun common stock in exchange for the merger consideration the holder is entitled to receive under the merger
agreement.

If a certificate for Sun common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the merger consideration upon
receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact by the claimant and (ii) if required by OceanFirst, the posting of a bond in an amount as
OceanFirst may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate.

Following completion of the first-step merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of Sun of shares of Sun
common stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. If, after the effective time, old certificates
representing shares of Sun common stock are presented for transfer to the exchange agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the
merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions to which the holder presenting such old
certificates is entitled.

Withholding

OceanFirst and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of OceanFirst common stock, cash dividends or distributions payable or any other cash amount payable under the merger
agreement to any person the amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. If any such amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, these amounts will be
treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the stockholders from whom they were withheld.

Dividends and Distributions

No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to OceanFirst common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificates of Sun common stock until the holder surrenders such certificate in accordance

with the terms of the merger agreement. After the surrender of a certificate in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the
record holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which previously become payable after the closing date with respect to the stock consideration which the shares of Sun common stock
represented by such certificate have been converted into the right to receive under the merger agreement.

Treatment of Sun Equity-Based Awards

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

At the effective time, each restricted stock award in respect of shares of Sun common stock granted under any Sun equity plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will become fully vested and the restrictions thereon will lapse, and each holder of
such restricted stock award will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive the cash
consideration or the stock consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such award, subject to the
allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement.

At the effective time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Sun common stock granted under any Sun equity plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled in full, and each holder of such restricted stock unit award will
be entitled to receive the merger consideration and will have the right to elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock
consideration with respect to each share of Sun common stock held subject to such award, subject to the allocation and proration
provisions of the merger agreement.

Stock Options

Also at the effective time, all outstanding and unexercised options granted under any Sun equity plan to purchase Sun common stock
will be converted into options to purchase a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Sun common stock subject to such Sun stock option immediately prior to the
effective time by (ii) the exchange ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (a) the per share exercise price for each share of Sun common stock subject to such Sun stock option by (b) the
exchange ratio.

Governance Matters after the Transactions

Upon the consummation of the integrated mergers, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of OceanFirst in effect immediately prior
to the effective time will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the combined company after completion of the integrated
mergers, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of such documents.

Effective as of the effective time, OceanFirst has agreed to (i) increase the size of the OceanFirst board to fourteen members and, in its
capacity as the sole shareholder of OceanFirst Bank, take such actions as may be necessary to increase the size of the OceanFirst Bank
board to fourteen members and (ii) appoint two current members of the Sun board, to be selected by the Leadership Committee of
OceanFirst in consultation with the OceanFirst board and the Sun board, to the OceanFirst board and the OceanFirst Bank board, with
each such appointee being appointed to a class of boards of OceanFirst and OceanFirst Bank to be selected by OceanFirst in its
discretion (provided that such appointees will be allocated among the classes as evenly as possible). If, prior to the two year
anniversary of the closing date, any such appointee resigns from such directorship, then the Leadership Committee of OceanFirst will
be required to select a current member of the Sun board as a candidate to fill the vacancy created by such resignation and put forth such
candidate for consideration by the OceanFirst board in accordance with the OceanFirst bylaws.

Table of Contents

Closing and Effective Time

The integrated mergers will be completed only if all conditions to the integrated mergers set forth in the merger agreement (as
discussed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus) are either satisfied or waived. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “— Conditions to Complete the Integrated Mergers.”

The first-step merger will become effective as of the date and time specified in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of New Jersey. The second-step merger will become effective as set forth in the certificate of mergers to be filed with
the Delaware Secretary of State and New Jersey Secretary of State. Subject to the immediately following sentence, OceanFirst and Sun
have agreed that the closing of the integrated mergers will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first business day that
is both (i) the last business day of a month or, if the closing is anticipated to occur in January, the first business day of the month of
January solely to the extent that the parties are able to, on such date and at or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, submit and
confirm acceptance of the filing of the first-step merger certificate with the New Jersey Secretary of State and the second-step merger
certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State and (ii) no earlier than the third business day after the date on which the conditions set
forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another date or time is agreed to in writing by OceanFirst
and Sun. However, OceanFirst and Sun have also agreed that the closing will not occur prior to January 1, 2018 unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by OceanFirst and Sun. OceanFirst and Sun currently expect to complete the Transactions early in the first quarter
of 2018. However, neither OceanFirst nor Sun can assure you of when, or if, the Transactions will be completed. The completion of the
integrated mergers is subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including the approval by the OceanFirst stockholders
of the OceanFirst share issuance proposal, the approval by the Sun shareholders of the Sun merger proposal and the receipt of all
required regulatory approvals.

Representations and Warranties

The representations, warranties and covenants described below, and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and included in
the merger agreement were made by OceanFirst and Sun for the benefit of the other party, only for purposes of the merger agreement
and as of specific dates. In addition, the representations, warranties and covenants may be subject to limitations, qualifications or
exceptions agreed upon by the parties to the merger agreement, including those included in confidential disclosures made for the
purposes of, among other things, allocating contractual risk between OceanFirst and Sun rather than establishing matters as facts, and
may be subject to standards of materiality that differ from those standards relevant to investors. Moreover, information concerning the
subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent
information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by OceanFirst or Sun. Therefore, you should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of
OceanFirst, Sun or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates without considering the foregoing. The representations and
warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read only in conjunction with
the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 146. OceanFirst and Sun will provide additional disclosure in their respective public reports to the
extent they become aware of the existence of any material facts that are required to be disclosed under federal securities laws and that
might otherwise contradict the representations and warranties in the merger agreement and will update such disclosure as required by
the federal securities laws.

The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties of each of OceanFirst and Sun relating to their respective
businesses. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time.

Covenants and Agreements

Conduct of Business Prior to the Effective Time

Sun has agreed that, prior to the effective time or earlier termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to
specified exceptions, it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, conduct its business in the ordinary course in all material
respects, use reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization, employees, independent contractors and
advantageous business relationships and take no action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or delay its ability to
obtain any necessary approvals of any governmental entity or regulatory agency required for the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or to perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby on a timely basis.

Additionally, prior to the effective time or earlier termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to specified
exceptions, Sun may not, and may not permit any of its subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of OceanFirst, which, consent
cannot be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, undertake the following actions:
 

 

•  other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, incur any indebtedness for borrowed money
(other than indebtedness of Sun or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries to Sun or any of its other subsidiaries), assume,

convertible only after the passage of time or the occurrence of certain events) into or exchangeable for any shares of its
capital stock (except (i) regular quarterly cash dividends by Sun at a rate not in excess of $0.01 per share of Sun common
stock (except that if OceanFirst increases the rate of its regular quarterly dividends on OceanFirst common stock paid by it
during any fiscal quarter after the date the merger agreement relative to that paid by it during the immediately preceding
fiscal quarter, Sun will be permitted to increase the rate of dividends on Sun common stock paid by it during the same fiscal
quarter by the same proportion (or if not possible in the same quarter, in the next fiscal quarter with an appropriate
“catch-up” adjustment to account for the amounts that would have been paid in the prior quarter) subject in all respects to
any receipt of regulatory approval required in connection with such dividend increase), (ii) dividends paid by any of the
subsidiaries of Sun to Sun or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or (iii) the acceptance of shares of Sun common stock as

right to acquire any shares of its capital stock;

“treasury shares” as of the date of the merger agreement) any additional shares of capital stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into, or exercisable for, any shares of its capital stock or any options, warrants, or other rights of any kind to

Sun (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), undertake the following actions:

transactions contemplated thereby; or

 

 
•  agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of the OceanFirst board or similar governing body in

Regulatory Matters

OceanFirst and Sun have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as

Table of Contents

practicable all requisite regulatory approvals and other permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
governmental entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
OceanFirst and Sun have also agreed to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to the requests of governmental entities for
documents and information. Each of OceanFirst and Sun have agreed in the merger agreement to provide the other with copies of any
applications and correspondence (other than any applications filed and correspondence made on behalf of OceanFirst in connection
with the contemplated conversion of OceanFirst Bank into a national banking association and the related change of OceanFirst
becoming a bank holding company) relating to the regulatory approvals for the Transactions prior to filing such applications, and to
provide such other party with a sufficient opportunity to comment, in each case, subject to certain exceptions for competitively
sensitive information and proprietary information. However, in no event will OceanFirst or Sun be required to take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the required permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be expected to result in a materially burdensome
regulatory condition. OceanFirst and Sun have also agreed to furnish each other with all information reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application to any governmental entity in connection with the Transactions, as well
as to keep each other apprised of the status of matters related to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Employee Benefit Matters

OceanFirst has agreed that, for the period commencing on the effective time and ending on the first anniversary of the effective time,
OceanFirst will, or will cause the combined company to, provide to each employee of Sun or its subsidiaries who continues to be
employed by OceanFirst or its subsidiaries immediately following the effective time, while employed by OceanFirst or its subsidiaries
after the effective time (and thereafter in the case of compensation or benefits payable following a termination of employment), with
(i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided
by Sun or any of its subsidiaries to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) short- and long-term
incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity and equity-based compensation) that, in each case, are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the short- and long-term incentive compensation opportunities provided by Sun or any of its
subsidiaries to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time and (iii) other compensation and employee
benefits (other than severance benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other compensation and employee
benefits provided by Sun or any of its subsidiaries to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time. In
addition, OceanFirst has agreed to cause the combined company or one of its subsidiaries to provide to each continuing employee
whose employment terminates during the 12-month period following the effective time with severance benefits equal to the greater of
(A) the severance benefits for which such continuing employee was eligible as of immediately prior to the effective time and (B) the
severance benefits for which employees of OceanFirst and its subsidiaries who are similarly situated to such continuing employee
would be eligible under the severance plans or policies of OceanFirst or its affiliates, in each case, determined without taking into
account any reduction after the effective time in the compensation paid to such continuing employee.

Under the merger agreement, OceanFirst has agreed to, effective as of the effective time, assume and honor all Sun benefit plans in
accordance with their terms. OceanFirst has further acknowledged that a “change in control” within the meaning of the Sun benefit
plans will occur at the effective time.

The merger agreement, with respect to the continuing employees, requires the combined company to:
 

 

•  use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any benefit plans
of the combined company, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under the analogous Sun benefit plan;

Table of Contents

 

•  provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
effective time under a benefit plan sponsored by Sun to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Sun
benefit plan prior to the effective time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any new
benefit plans of the combined company; and

 

 
•  recognize all service of such employees with Sun and its subsidiaries, for all purposes in any benefit plan of the combined

company to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Sun benefit plan prior to the
effective time, subject to certain limitations.

Unless OceanFirst requests otherwise in writing, effective prior to the closing, Sun will terminate the Sun 401(k) Plan. In connection
with the termination of the Sun 401(k) Plan, plan participants would become vested in any accrued but unvested benefits under the Sun
401(k) Plan and would receive any unpaid employer matching contribution in respect of the year in which the effective time occurs. As
soon as practicable following the effective time, OceanFirst will permit or cause its subsidiaries to permit the continuing employees to
(i) roll over their account balances and outstanding loan balances, if any, under the Sun 401(k) Plan into an “eligible retirement plan”
within the meaning of Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Code maintained by OceanFirst or its subsidiaries and (ii) reinvest the proceeds of
any holdings in a Sun company stock fund that were liquidated in connection with the effective time into a OceanFirst common stock
fund. OceanFirst will take any and all actions reasonably necessary to permit each continuing employee with an outstanding loan
balance under the Sun 401(k) Plan as of the effective time to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Sun 401(k) Plan after it
is terminated pending the distribution and rollover of the continuing employee’s account balance from the Sun 401(k) Plan to the
OceanFirst retirement plan, such as to prevent a loan offset with respect to such outstanding loan.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

Under the terms of the merger agreement OceanFirst has agreed to, following the effective time, indemnify and hold harmless all
present and former directors, officers and employees of Sun and its subsidiaries or fiduciaries of Sun or any of its subsidiaries under the
Sun benefit plans against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the effective time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to,
(i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Sun or its subsidiaries or (ii) matters, acts or omissions existing
or occurring at or prior to the effective time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the consideration and
approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case, to
the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of the merger agreement by Sun pursuant to Sun’s certificate of
incorporation, Sun’s bylaws or the governing or organizational documents of any subsidiary of Sun, and has also agreed to advance
expenses to such persons to the same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of the merger
agreement by Sun pursuant to Sun’s certificate, Sun’s bylaws or the governing or organizational documents of any subsidiary of Sun,
provided that, if requested by OceanFirst, such person provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

The merger agreement requires the combined company to maintain, for a period of six years after the effective time, Sun’s existing
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, or policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured, with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or prior to the effective time. However, the combined company is not required to spend annually more than
300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date of the merger agreement by Sun for such insurance (which we refer to as the
“premium cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the premium cap, then the

Table of Contents

combined company will maintain policies of insurance which, in its good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Sun, in consultation with OceanFirst, may (and at the request
of OceanFirst, Sun will use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the effective time a six year “tail” policy under Sun’s
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if such a
policy can be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed, on an annual basis, the premium cap. If a “tail policy” is
purchased, the combined company is required to maintain in full force and effect and not cancel such policy. The obligations of the
combined company, OceanFirst and Sun will not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Sun indemnified
party or any other person entitled to the benefit of indemnification without the prior written consent of the affected Sun indemnified
party. If the combined company or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other
entity or engages in any similar transaction, the combined company is required to cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the combined company will expressly assume the foregoing obligations.

Restructuring Efforts

In the absence of additional circumstances specified in the merger agreement and as described in “The Merger Agreement —
Termination of the Merger Agreement,” neither OceanFirst nor Sun is permitted to terminate the merger agreement based on the failure
of either such party to obtain the required vote of its stockholders. Instead, each of the parties will in good faith use its reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions provided for in the merger agreement (except that neither party will have any
obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital
stock of Sun as provided for in the merger agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or adversely affect the tax
treatment of the integrated mergers with respect to the Sun shareholders) and/or resubmit the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby (or as restructured) to its respective stockholders for approval.

Certain Additional Covenants

The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, obtaining required consents, the listing of the shares of OceanFirst common stock to be issued in the first-step
merger, access to information of Sun, the permissibility of representatives of OceanFirst and OceanFirst Bank’s attendance of Sun
board meetings and certain committee meetings following the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals (subject to certain
confidentiality restrictions), exemption from takeover laws, public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, access to information on certain of Sun’s originating lenders, the assumption of Sun’s outstanding indebtedness and
restrictions on OceanFirst controlling Sun prior to the effective time.

Stockholder Meetings and Recommendation of the Boards of Directors of Sun and OceanFirst

Sun has agreed to hold a meeting of its shareholders, and OceanFirst has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose
of obtaining the requisite Sun shareholder approval of the merger agreement, in the case of Sun shareholders, and the requisite
OceanFirst stockholder approval of the OceanFirst share issuance, in the case of OceanFirst stockholders, in each case, as soon as
reasonably practicable after this joint proxy statement/prospectus is declared effective. Sun has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from its shareholders the vote required to approve the merger agreement, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in this joint proxy statement/prospectus) that they approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and OceanFirst has made similar covenants with respect to the OceanFirst share
issuance. However, if the OceanFirst board, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith

that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend the
OceanFirst share issuance, then OceanFirst may (but will not be required to) withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Sun
or submit the OceanFirst share issuance to its stockholders without a recommendation (which we refer to as an “OceanFirst adverse
recommendation change”) and may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders to the extent required
by law; provided, that the OceanFirst board may not take any such action unless (i) OceanFirst gives Sun at least three business days’
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action; (ii) at the end of such notice period, the OceanFirst board takes into account any amendment or
modification to the merger agreement proposed by Sun (it being understood that Sun will not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement), and after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend the merger agreement. If
the Sun board, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines
in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to
recommend the merger agreement, then it may (but will not be required to) withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
OceanFirst or submit the merger agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (which we refer to as a “Sun adverse
recommendation change”) and may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders to the extent required
by law; provided that the Sun board may not take any such actions unless (i) if such action is taken in response to an acquisition
proposal (as such term is defined below in “The Merger Agreement — Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers”), such acquisition
proposal did not result from a breach by Sun of its obligations relating to the non-solicitation of acquisition proposals and such
acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal (as such term is defined below in “The Merger Agreement — Agreement Not to
Solicit Other Offers”) and (ii) Sun gives OceanFirst at least three business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action
and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, if such action
is taken in response to an acquisition proposal, its basis for determining that such acquisition proposal, constitutes a superior proposal
(including the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third-party making, any such acquisition proposal, or any
amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other events or circumstances)); and (iii) at the end of such
notice period, the Sun board takes into account any amendment or modification to the merger agreement proposed by OceanFirst (it
being understood that OceanFirst will not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement), and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend the merger agreement (and, if such action is taken in response to an acquisition
proposal, that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal). Any material amendment to any acquisition proposal will require a new
determination and notice period.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of OceanFirst and Sun has agreed to adjourn or postpone the OceanFirst special
meeting or the Sun special meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of OceanFirst common stock or Sun common stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, Sun or OceanFirst, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the requisite Sun shareholder
approval or the requisite OceanFirst stockholder approval. However, OceanFirst will not be required to adjourn or postpone the
OceanFirst special meeting in the case of an OceanFirst adverse recommendation change that it is permitted to make under the merger
agreement, as described in the previous paragraph. Similarly, Sun will not be required to adjourn or postpone the Sun special meeting
in the case of a Sun adverse recommendation change that it is permitted to make under the merger agreement, as described in the
previous paragraph. Additionally, OceanFirst and Sun will only be required to adjourn or postpone the OceanFirst special meeting or
the Sun special meeting, as applicable, two times.

Table of Contents

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers

Sun has agreed that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to,
(ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or
data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to, any acquisition proposal except, for purposes of this
clause (iii), to notify such person of the existence of these non-solicit provisions of the merger agreement. However, for purposes of the
above clause (iii), if Sun receives an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal prior to the date of receipt of the requisite Sun
shareholder approval and such proposal did not result from a breach of Sun’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement,
Sun may, and may permit its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives to, furnish
or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Sun board
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors)
that (A) such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and (B) failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that, prior to providing any such
nonpublic information or data or participating in any discussions, in each case, Sun provides such information or data to OceanFirst
and enters into a confidentiality agreement with such third-party on terms no less favorable to it than the confidentiality agreement
between OceanFirst and Sun, and which confidentiality agreement does not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate
with Sun.

Sun has also agreed to, and to cause its officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of the merger agreement with any person other than OceanFirst, with
respect to any acquisition proposal. In addition, Sun has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to
(a) enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement relating to an acquisition proposal and (b) within ten business days after
the date of the merger agreement, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person
(other than OceanFirst) pursuant to such confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement. Promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
following receipt of any acquisition proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, Sun
will advise OceanFirst of such acquisition proposal or inquiry and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or acquisition proposal and copies of any written acquisition proposal and written
summaries of any material oral communications relating to an acquisition proposal), and will keep OceanFirst apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry
or acquisition proposal.

For purposes of the merger agreement, an “acquisition proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in: (A) any acquisition or purchase, direct
or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Sun and its subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Sun or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets
of Sun; (B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third-party
beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Sun or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Sun; or (C) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Sun (or any of its
subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Sun).

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means any bona fide written offer or proposal made by a third party for an
acquisition proposal that the Sun board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors): (A) would, if consummated,

Table of Contents

result in the acquisition of substantially all, but not less than substantially all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Sun common
stock or all or substantially all of the assets of Sun; (B) would result in a transaction that (1) involves consideration to the holders of the
shares of Sun common stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the shareholders
of Sun pursuant to the merger agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration being offered and any
material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond, or in addition to, those
specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining financing and (2) is, in light of the other terms
of such proposal, more favorable to the shareholders of Sun than the integrated mergers and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement; and (C) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the acquisition proposal.

None of the foregoing obligations or restrictions, or any other provision in the merger agreement, require Sun or the Sun board to not
comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an acquisition proposal; provided, that such rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under the merger agreement.

Conditions to Complete the Integrated Mergers

OceanFirst’s and Sun’s respective obligations to complete the integrated mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
following customary closing conditions:
 

 
•  the approval of the merger agreement by the Sun shareholders and the approval of the OceanFirst share issuance by the

OceanFirst stockholders;
 

 
•  the authorization for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, of the OceanFirst common stock to be

the Code; and

 

 
•  delivery by Sun to OceanFirst of a duly executed certificate stating that Sun is not, and has not been during the relevant

period, a “United States real property holding corporation.”

Neither Sun nor OceanFirst can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the integrated mergers will be satisfied or waived or that the
integrated mergers will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to the effective time in the following circumstances:
 

 •  by mutual written consent, if the OceanFirst board and the Sun board so determine;
 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board or the Sun board, if (i) any governmental entity denies any requisite regulatory approval in
connection with the Transactions and such denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) any governmental entity of
competent jurisdiction has issued a final and nonappealable order permanently prohibiting or making illegal the
Transactions, unless the failure to obtain a requisite regulatory approval is due to the failure of the terminating party to
perform or observe its obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board or the Sun board, if the integrated mergers have not been consummated on or before the termination
date, which is the one year anniversary of the date of the merger agreement, unless the failure of the integrated mergers to be
consummated by such date is due to the failure of the terminating party to perform or observe its obligations under the
merger agreement;

 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board or the Sun board (except that the terminating party cannot then be in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement), if the other party breaches any of
its obligations or any of its representations and warranties (or any such representation or warranty ceases to be true) set forth
in the merger agreement which either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party would constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the closing date, the failure of a closing condition of the terminating party and such breach is
not cured within forty-five days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or such breach cannot be
cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the termination date);

 

 

•  by the Sun board, prior to the time that the OceanFirst share issuance proposal is approved, if the OceanFirst board (i) fails
to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the OceanFirst stockholders approve the OceanFirst share
issuance, or takes certain adverse actions with respect to such recommendation or (ii) materially breaches certain obligations
with respect to calling a meeting of its stockholders and recommending that they approve the OceanFirst share issuance; or

 

 

•  by the OceanFirst board, prior to the time that the Sun merger proposal is approved, if the Sun board (i) fails to recommend
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the Sun shareholders approve the merger agreement, or takes certain adverse
actions with respect to such recommendation, (ii) fails to recommend against acceptance of any publicly disclosed tender
offer or exchange offer for outstanding Sun common stock (other than by OceanFirst or an affiliate of OceanFirst), within
the ten business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, (iii) recommends or endorses an acquisition
proposal or (iv) materially breaches certain obligations with respect to acquisition proposals or calling a meeting of its
shareholders and recommending that they approve the merger agreement.

If Sun or OceanFirst desires to exercise its termination right as described above, the terminating party must notify the non-terminating
party in writing and specify in that notice the provision or provisions of the merger agreement pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

Table of Contents

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and have no effect, except that (i) each of OceanFirst and Sun will remain
liable for any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or knowing, intentional and material breach of any provision of the merger
agreement (which, in the case of Sun, will include the loss to the holders of Sun common stock of the economic benefits of the
integrated mergers, including the loss of the premium offered to the Sun shareholders) and (ii) designated provisions of the merger
agreement will survive the termination, including those relating to payment of termination fees and expenses and the confidential
treatment of information.

Termination Fee

In the event that, after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the termination of the merger agreement, (i) a bona fide acquisition
proposal has been made known to senior management or the Sun board or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any
person has publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an acquisition proposal with respect to Sun, (ii) (A) thereafter the merger
agreement is terminated by either OceanFirst or Sun because the integrated mergers have not been completed prior to the termination
date, and without the requisite Sun shareholder vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated by
OceanFirst based on a knowing and material breach of the merger agreement by Sun occurring after the date of the acquisition proposal
that would constitute the failure of a closing condition and that has not been cured during the permitted time period or by its nature
cannot be cured during such period and (iii) within 12 months after the date of such termination, Sun enters into a definitive agreement
or consummates a transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal (whether or not the same acquisition proposal as that referred to
above), then Sun has agreed to, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay OceanFirst, by wire transfer of same day funds, a $17,045,000 termination fee; provided, that for the purposes of
clause (iii), all references in the definition of acquisition proposal to “25%” will instead refer to “50%” and clause (C) of the definition
of acquisition proposal will be deemed followed by “as a result of which holders of Sun common stock immediately prior to such
transaction cease to own at least 50% of the common stock of the surviving or resulting company (or its ultimate parent) immediately
after such transaction.”

In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by OceanFirst based on the Sun board having (i) failed to recommend in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus that the Sun shareholders approve the merger agreement, or takes certain adverse actions with respect to
such recommendation, (ii) failed to recommend against acceptance of any publicly disclosed tender offer or exchange offer for
outstanding Sun common stock (other than by OceanFirst or an affiliate of OceanFirst), within the ten business day period specified in
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, (iii) recommended or endorsed an acquisition proposal or (iv) materially breached certain
obligations with respect to acquisition proposals or calling a meeting of its shareholders and recommending that they approve the
merger agreement, then Sun has agreed to pay OceanFirst, by wire transfer of same day funds, a $17,045,000 termination fee on the
date of termination. If Sun is required to pay the termination fee in accordance with the preceding sentence, without limiting the right
of any party to recover liabilities or damages and without limiting the rights of OceanFirst to interest on overdue payment of the
termination fee, to reimbursement of costs and expenses in relation to filing suit to recover the termination fee and to file suit for cause
of fraud or a knowing, intentional and material breach, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by Sun will be the termination
fee equal to $17,045,000. In no event will Sun be required to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.

In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by Sun based on the OceanFirst board having (i) failed to recommend in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus that the Sun shareholders approve the merger agreement, or takes certain adverse actions with respect to
such recommendation, or (ii) materially breached certain obligations with respect to acquisition proposals or calling a meeting of its
stockholders and recommending that they approve the merger agreement, OceanFirst has agreed to pay Sun, by wire transfer of same
day funds on the date

of termination, a $17,045,000 termination fee. If OceanFirst is required to pay the termination fee in accordance with the preceding
sentence, without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages and without limiting the rights of Sun to interest on
overdue payment of the termination fee, to reimbursement of costs and expenses in relation to filing suit to recover the termination fee
and to file suit for cause of fraud or a knowing, intentional and material breach, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by
OceanFirst will be the termination fee equal to $17,045,000. In no event will OceanFirst be required to pay the termination fee on more
than one occasion.

If the $17,045,000 termination fee is paid by OceanFirst or Sun, the parties have agreed that the termination fee will constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the cause of fraud or a knowing, intentional and material breach, will be the sole
monetary remedy of OceanFirst or Sun, as applicable, in the event of a termination of the merger agreement as specified in this section
of the registration statement.

Expenses and Fees

Except as expressly provided in the merger agreement (including the provisions relating to the entitlement of each of OceanFirst and
Sun to a termination fee under certain circumstances), all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that the costs and expenses of printing and
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the integrated mergers
will be borne equally by OceanFirst and Sun.

Amendment, Waiver and Extension of the Merger Agreement

Subject to compliance with applicable law, the merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with integrated mergers by the Sun shareholders and the OceanFirst stockholders, provided that
after approval of the merger agreement by the Sun shareholders or the approval of the issuance of shares of OceanFirst common stock
in connection with the first-step merger by the OceanFirst stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, any amendment of the merger agreement that requires further approval under applicable
law. The merger agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any matter except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of Sun and OceanFirst.

At any time prior to the effective time, Sun and OceanFirst may, to the extent legally permitted, extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the
merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement, and waive compliance with any of the agreements
or satisfaction of any conditions contained in the merger agreement, provided that after approval of the merger agreement by the Sun
shareholders or the approval of the issuance of shares of OceanFirst common stock in connection with the first-step merger by the
OceanFirst stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, any extension
or waiver of the merger agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law.

THE SUN VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS

The following description of the Sun voting and support agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the express
terms of the Sun voting and support agreements, forms of which are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and
Annex C and are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, members of the Brown family (including certain directors of Sun) entered
into separate voting and support agreements with OceanFirst. In addition, simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement,
WLR entered into a voting and support agreement with OceanFirst. Neither Sun nor Sun National Bank is a party to these agreements.
As of the Sun record date, the Sun supporting shareholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 7,351,065
shares of the Sun common stock (approximately 39% of the outstanding shares of Sun common stock). Under these voting and support
agreements, each such Sun supporting shareholder has agreed among other things, to vote all shares of Sun common stock that such
Sun supporting shareholder owns of record or beneficially, and that such Sun supporting shareholder subsequently acquires, in favor of
the approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the first-step merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Each Sun supporting shareholder has also agreed to vote against (i) any acquisition proposal made in opposition to or
otherwise in competition or inconsistent with the first-step merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) any
agreement, amendment of any agreement (including the Sun articles of incorporation and bylaws) or any other action that is intended
or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or, in any material respect, interfere with, delay, postpone or discourage the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (iii) any action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation of Sun in the merger agreement.

Each Sun supporting shareholder who executed a voting and support agreement agreed, in such Sun supporting shareholder’s capacity
as a Sun shareholder, not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal, (ii) provide or cause to be provided any nonpublic information or data relating to Sun in connection with, or have
any discussions with, any person relating to or in connection with an actual or proposed acquisition proposal (except to disclose the
existence of these restrictions), (iii) engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal (provided that such
Sun supporting shareholder may refer any such person or entity to these restrictions) or otherwise take any action to encourage or
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal, (iv) approve, recommend, agree to or accept,
or propose publicly to approve, recommend, agree to or accept, any acquisition proposal, (v) solicit proxies or become a “participant”
in a “solicitation” (as such terms are defined in the Exchange Act) with respect to an acquisition proposal or otherwise encourage or
assist any party in taking or planning any action that would reasonably be expected to compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to
interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the first-step merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,
(vi) initiate a shareholders’ vote or action by consent of Sun’s shareholders with respect to an acquisition proposal, (vii) become a
member of a “group” (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of Sun that takes
any action in support of an acquisition proposal, or (viii) approve, endorse or recommend, agree to or accept, or propose to approve,
endorse, recommend, agree to or accept, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
investment agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any acquisition proposal. Certain
voting and support agreements provide that, with respect to each Sun supporting shareholder that is a director of Sun, the covenants
described in this paragraph will not limit the ability of such Sun director, in such Sun director’s capacity as such, from taking any
action to the extent such action is consistent with the director’s obligations under the merger agreement with respect to acquisition
proposals or calling a meeting of its shareholders and recommending that they approve the merger agreement.

In addition, under the voting and support agreements, the Sun supporting shareholders have agreed that: (a) effective as of the effective
time, certain securities purchase agreements between the applicable Sun supporting shareholders, on the one hand, and Sun, on the
other hand, will be terminated and (b) if requested by the Federal Reserve Board, the applicable Sun supporting shareholder will
submit customary passivity and anti-association commitments to the Federal Reserve Board in order to obtain the concurrence of the
Federal Reserve Board that no such Sun supporting shareholder will control OceanFirst or OceanFirst Bank for purposes of HOLA or
the BHCA.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

The integrated mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of FASB
ASC Topic 805-10, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable intangible
assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts and other commitments) of Sun as of the effective date of the integrated mergers
will be recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of OceanFirst. If the purchase price exceeds the difference between
the fair value of assets acquired and the fair value of the liabilities assumed, then such excess will be recorded as goodwill. Financial
statements of OceanFirst issued after the completion of the integrated mergers will reflect these fair values and will not be restated
retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Sun before the integrated mergers.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE INTEGRATED MERGERS

The following is a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated mergers to “U.S. holders” (as defined
below) of Sun common stock and is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and
judicial decisions in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this
discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax
pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the laws
of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction or under any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the income tax.

The following discussion applies only to U.S. holders of Sun common stock who hold such shares as capital assets within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects
of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances and does not apply to
U.S. holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as, for example, dealers or brokers in securities,
commodities or foreign currencies, traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, banks and certain
other financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, tax-exempt organizations, holders subject to the alternative minimum
tax provisions of the Code, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, S corporations or
other flow-through entities (and investors therein), regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign
corporations, passive foreign investment companies, former citizens or residents of the United States, holders whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar, holders who hold shares of Sun common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or other integrated investment, holders who acquired Sun common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation or holders who actually or constructively own five
percent or more of Sun common stock).

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Sun common stock that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or entity treated as a corporation, organized in
or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust if (a) a court within the United States
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control
all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or (iv) an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of its
source.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Sun common stock, the tax treatment of
a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Sun common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult
their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to their specific circumstances.

It is a condition to the obligation of OceanFirst and Sun to complete the integrated mergers that they receive a written opinion from
their counsel, dated the closing date of the integrated mergers, to the effect that the integrated mergers will together be treated as an
integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In the opinion of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the integrated mergers will together be treated as an integrated
transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, with the tax consequences described
below. These opinions of counsel will be given in reliance on facts and representations contained in representation letters provided by
OceanFirst and Sun and on customary assumptions.

Table of Contents

These opinions will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or any court. OceanFirst and Sun have not sought and
will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the integrated mergers and, as a result, there can be no assurance
that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition,
if any of the representations or assumptions upon which those opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the integrated mergers could be adversely affected.

The United States federal income tax consequences of the integrated mergers to U.S. holders of Sun common stock will depend on
whether the U.S. holder receives cash, shares of OceanFirst common stock or a combination thereof in exchange for such U.S. holder’s
Sun common stock. At the time that a U.S. holder makes a cash or stock election pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the
U.S. holder will not know whether, and to what extent, the proration rules of the merger agreement may alter the mix of consideration
to be received. As a result, the tax consequences to U.S. holders will not be ascertainable with certainty until the precise amount of
cash and shares of OceanFirst common stock that will be received by each U.S. holder in the integrated mergers has been determined.

Exchange of Shares of Sun Common Stock Solely for Shares of OceanFirst Common Stock

U.S. holders who exchange all of their shares of Sun common stock for OceanFirst common stock in the integrated mergers pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement will not recognize any gain or loss, except in respect of cash received in lieu of a fractional share.
The U.S. holder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of OceanFirst common stock received in the integrated mergers (including
fractional shares deemed received and redeemed, as described below under “— Cash In Lieu of Fractional Shares”) will be equal to the
U.S. holder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in its shares of Sun common stock surrendered for the shares of OceanFirst common stock,
and the holding period for the shares of OceanFirst common stock (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed, as
described below) will include the period during which the shares of Sun common stock were held.

Exchange of Shares of Sun Common Stock Solely for Cash

U.S. holders who exchange all of their shares of Sun common stock solely for cash in the integrated mergers pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
aggregate tax basis in the shares of Sun common stock surrendered. Gain or loss must be calculated separately and the holding period
must be determined separately for each block of shares of Sun common stock if blocks of Sun common stock were acquired at different
times or for different prices. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for a
particular block of Sun common stock exceeds one year on the closing date of the integrated mergers. Although the law in this area is
unclear, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns OceanFirst common stock immediately after the integrated mergers, it is
possible that the U.S. federal income tax consequences to that holder may be similar to the U.S. federal income tax consequences
described below under “— Potential Treatment of Cash as a Dividend,” except that the amount of consideration, if any, treated as a
dividend may not be limited to the amount of that holder’s gain.

Exchange of Shares of Sun Common Stock for a Combination of Cash and Shares of OceanFirst Common Stock

U.S. holders who exchange all of their shares of Sun common stock for a combination of shares of OceanFirst common stock and cash
(excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of OceanFirst common stock) in the integrated mergers pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of such cash
received in the integrated mergers and (ii) the U.S. holder’s gain realized (i.e., the excess, if any, of the sum of the amount of such cash
and the fair market value, as of the closing date, of the shares of OceanFirst common stock received in the integrated mergers over

Table of Contents

the U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in its shares of Sun common stock surrendered in exchange therefor). Any recognized gain will be
capital gain unless the U.S. holder’s receipt of cash has the effect of a distribution of a dividend (as described below under “—
Potential Treatment of Cash as a Dividend”), in which case the gain will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. holder’s
ratable share of Sun’s accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for United States federal income tax purposes. Capital gain will
generally be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder’s holding period for its Sun common stock exceeds one year as of the closing date
of the integrated mergers.

U.S. holders must calculate the amount of gain or loss realized separately for each share of Sun common stock surrendered. U.S.
holders of Sun common stock who acquired different blocks of Sun common stock at different times or for different prices should
consult their tax advisors regarding the manner in which to allocate cash and OceanFirst common stock shares among different blocks
of Sun common stock. A loss realized on one block of Sun common stock cannot be used to offset a realized gain that is recognized on
another block of Sun common stock.

A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in its shares of OceanFirst common stock received in the integrated mergers (including the basis
allocable to any fractional share of OceanFirst common stock deemed received and redeemed, as described below under “— Cash In
Lieu of Fractional Shares”) will be equal to the U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares of Sun common stock surrendered in the
integrated mergers, decreased by the amount of cash received (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of OceanFirst
common stock) and increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized or any amount treated as a dividend, as described below (but
excluding any gain resulting from the deemed receipt and redemption of any fractional share of OceanFirst common stock, as described
below under “— Cash In Lieu of Fractional Shares”). A U.S. holder’s holding period for shares of OceanFirst common stock received
in the integrated mergers will include the holding period for the block of Sun common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.

Potential Treatment of Cash as a Dividend.

If a U.S. holder receives cash in the integrated mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, any gain recognized may be
treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of the U.S. holder’s ratable share of Sun’s accumulated
“earnings and profits.” In general, the determination of whether such gain recognized will be treated as capital gain or a dividend
depends upon whether and to what extent the exchange reduces the U.S. holder’s deemed percentage of stock ownership of OceanFirst.
For purposes of this determination, the U.S. holder generally will be treated as if it first exchanged all of its shares of Sun common
stock solely for OceanFirst common stock and then OceanFirst immediately redeemed a portion of the OceanFirst common stock in
exchange for the cash the U.S. holder actually received, which redemption we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
“deemed redemption.” Such gain recognized by a U.S. holder pursuant to the deemed redemption will be treated as capital gain if the
deemed redemption is (i) “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. holder (and after the deemed redemption the U.S.
holder actually or constructively owns less than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding OceanFirst common stock) or (ii) not
“essentially equivalent to a dividend.”

The deemed redemption generally will be “substantially disproportionate” with respect to a U.S. holder if the percentage of the
outstanding OceanFirst common stock that the U.S. holder actually and constructively owns immediately after the deemed redemption
is less than 80% of the percentage of the outstanding OceanFirst common stock that the U.S. holder is deemed actually and
constructively to have owned immediately before the deemed redemption. The deemed redemption will not be considered to be
“essentially equivalent to a dividend” if it results in a “meaningful reduction” in the U.S. holder’s deemed percentage of stock
ownership of OceanFirst. The IRS has ruled that a minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation whose relative stock interest is
minimal and who exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs is considered to have experienced a “meaningful reduction” if
the stockholder has at least a relatively minor reduction in such stockholder’s percentage of stock ownership under the above analysis.
In applying the above tests, the U.S.

holder may, under the constructive ownership rules, be deemed to own stock that is owned by other persons or otherwise in addition to
the stock the U.S. holder actually owns or owned.

As these rules are complex and dependent upon your specific circumstances, you should consult your tax advisor to determine whether
you may be subject to these rules.

Cash In Lieu of Fractional Shares.

A U.S. holder that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of OceanFirst common stock generally will be treated as having received
such fractional share and then as having received such cash in redemption of the fractional share. Gain or loss generally will be
recognized based on the difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional share and the portion of the U.S.
holder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of Sun common stock surrendered which is allocable to the fractional share. Such
gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for its Sun common stock exceeds one
year on the closing date of the integrated mergers.

This discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not intended to be, and
should not be construed as, tax advice. Determining the actual tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you may be
complex and will depend on your specific situation and on factors that are not within our control. You should consult your tax
advisors with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situations as well as any tax
consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing
jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF OCEANFIRST

The following is a brief description of the terms of the capital stock of OceanFirst. This summary does not purport to be complete in all
respects. This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL, federal law, OceanFirst’s certificate of
incorporation and OceanFirst’s bylaws. Copies of OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws have
been filed with the SEC and are also available upon request from OceanFirst. To find out where copies of these documents can be
obtained, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page
146.

Authorized Capital Stock

OceanFirst’s authorized capital stock consists of 55,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.

Common Stock

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of up to 55,000,000 shares of common stock. As of the
OceanFirst record date, there were (i) 32,562,477 shares of OceanFirst common stock issued and outstanding, including 162,023 shares
of OceanFirst common stock issued in respect of outstanding awards of restricted OceanFirst common stock under OceanFirst equity
plans (or in the former Cape equity plans or Ocean Shore equity plans that were assumed by OceanFirst in the Cape acquisition and the
Ocean Shore acquisition, as applicable (which we refer to as the “Cape equity plans” and the “Ocean Shore equity plans,”
respectively)), (ii) 1,004,295 shares of OceanFirst common stock held in treasury and (iii) 2,536,791 shares of OceanFirst common
stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to purchase shares of OceanFirst common stock granted
under such OceanFirst equity plans, the Cape equity plans or the Ocean Shore equity plans.

OceanFirst common stock is currently listed for quotation on the NASDAQ under the symbol “OCFC.”

Preemptive Rights; Redemption Rights; Terms of Conversion; Sinking Fund and Redemption Provision

OceanFirst’s common stock does not have preemptive rights, redemption rights, conversion rights, sinking fund or redemption
provisions.

Voting Rights

The holders of OceanFirst common stock have exclusive voting rights in OceanFirst. They elect the OceanFirst board and act on other
matters as are required to be presented to them under Delaware law or as are otherwise presented to them by the OceanFirst board.
Generally, each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share and will not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of
directors. OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the then
outstanding shares of OceanFirst common stock are not entitled to any vote with respect to the shares held in excess of the 10% limit.
A person or entity is deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an affiliate as well as persons acting in concert with such
person or entity. If OceanFirst issues shares of preferred stock, holders of the preferred stock may also possess voting rights. Certain
matters require an 80% stockholder vote, which is calculated after giving effect to the provision in OceanFirst’s certificate of
incorporation limiting voting rights as described above.

Liquidation Rights

In the event of OceanFirst’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock would be entitled to receive, after
payment or provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities, all of the assets of OceanFirst available for distribution. If preferred
stock is issued, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of

the common stock in the event of liquidation or dissolution. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of OceanFirst
Bank, OceanFirst, as the holder of 100% of OceanFirst Bank’s capital stock, would be entitled to receive, after payment or provision
for payment of all debts and liabilities of OceanFirst Bank, including all deposit accounts and accrued interest thereon, and after
distribution of the balance in the special liquidation account to eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders, all
assets of OceanFirst Bank available for distribution.

Dividend Rights

Holders of OceanFirst common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the OceanFirst board out of
legally available funds. The ability of the OceanFirst board to declare and pay dividends on OceanFirst common stock is subject to the
terms of applicable Delaware law and banking regulations. If OceanFirst issues shares of preferred stock, the holders thereof may have
a priority over the holders of the common stock with respect to dividends. For more information regarding OceanFirst’s ability to pay
dividends, see the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — Dividend Policy” beginning on page
84 and “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 146. OceanFirst’s principal source of income is dividends that are
declared and paid by OceanFirst Bank on its capital stock. Therefore, OceanFirst’s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the
receipt of dividends from OceanFirst Bank. Insured depository institutions such as OceanFirst Bank are prohibited from making capital
distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized,”
as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations. In the future, any declaration and payment of cash dividends will be
subject to the OceanFirst board’s evaluation of OceanFirst’s operating results, financial condition, future growth plans, general business
and economic conditions, and tax and other relevant considerations. The payment of cash dividends by OceanFirst in the future will
also be subject to certain other legal and regulatory limitations and ongoing review by the OceanFirst’s banking regulators.

Restrictions on Ownership

OceanFirst is currently a savings and loan holding company and therefore HOLA requires any “savings and loan holding company” (as
defined in HOLA) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring more than 5% of OceanFirst common stock. If
OceanFirst ceases to be a savings and loan holding company and becomes a bank holding company, the BHCA would require any
“bank holding company” (as defined in BHCA) to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring more than 5%
of OceanFirst common stock. Any person (other than a savings and loan holding company while OceanFirst is a savings and loan
holding company or other than a bank holding company if OceanFirst becomes a bank holding company) is required to provide prior
notice to the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring 10% or more of OceanFirst common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act
of 1978, as amended. Any person (other than an individual) who (a) owns, controls or has the power to vote 25% or more of any class
of OceanFirst’s voting securities; (b) has the ability to elect or appoint a majority of the OceanFirst board; or (c) otherwise has the
ability to exercise a “controlling influence” over OceanFirst, is subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company under
HOLA (while OceanFirst is a savings and loan holding company) or as a bank holding company under BHCA (if OceanFirst becomes
a bank holding company).

Preferred Stock

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the OceanFirst board, without further stockholder action, to issue up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock. OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation further authorizes the OceanFirst board, subject to any limitations
prescribed by law, to provide for the issuance of the shares of preferred stock in series, and by filing a certificate pursuant to the
applicable law of the State of Delaware, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to
fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof. As of the OceanFirst record date, there were no shares of OceanFirst preferred stock outstanding.

Table of Contents

Preferred stock may be issued with preferences and designations as the OceanFirst board may from time to time determine. The
OceanFirst board may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion
rights that could dilute the voting strength of the holders of OceanFirst common stock and may assist management in impeding an
unfriendly takeover or attempted change in control.

corporate infrastructure and governance, the elimination of duplicative operating systems and the combination of regulatory and

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of OceanFirst Business Combinations

Business Combination with Sun

On June 30, 2017, OceanFirst and Sun publicly announced that they had entered into the merger agreement pursuant to which,
(i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Sun, with Sun continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger and as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of OceanFirst (which we refer to as the “first-step merger”); (ii) immediately thereafter, Sun, as the surviving corporation in
the first-step merger, will merge with and into OceanFirst (which merger, together with the first-step merger, we refer to as the
“integrated mergers”), with OceanFirst being the surviving corporation; and (iii) immediately thereafter, Sun National Bank will merge
with and into OceanFirst Bank, with OceanFirst Bank being the surviving bank (which merger, together with the integrated mergers,
we refer to as the “Transactions”).

At the time the first-step merger is completed, each issued and outstanding share of Sun common stock, except for certain shares of
Sun common stock owned by Sun or OceanFirst, will be converted into the right to receive either (i) the cash consideration, which is an
amount in cash equal to the sum of (A) $3.78 plus (B) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by the OceanFirst share closing price, or (ii) the
stock consideration, which will be a number of shares of OceanFirst common stock equal to the exchange ratio, which is the quotient
of (A) the cash consideration divided by (B) the OceanFirst share closing price. Holders of Sun common stock will have the right to
elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the merger
agreement. The merger agreement provides that the aggregate amount of cash consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78
and (y) the total number of shares of Sun common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.

Business Combination with Ocean Shore

On November 30, 2016, OceanFirst completed the Ocean Shore acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement
governing the Ocean Shore acquisition, (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of OceanFirst merged with and into Ocean Shore, with Ocean
Shore surviving; (ii) immediately thereafter, Ocean Shore merged with and into OceanFirst, with OceanFirst surviving; and
(iii) immediately thereafter, Ocean City Home Bank merged with and into OceanFirst Bank, with OceanFirst Bank surviving. The total
consideration paid by OceanFirst in the Ocean Shore acquisition was $180.7 million, including cash consideration of $28.4 million.

Business Combination with Cape

On May 2, 2016, OceanFirst completed the Cape acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement governing the Cape
acquisition, (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of OceanFirst merged with and into Cape, with Cape surviving; (ii) immediately thereafter,
Cape merged with and into OceanFirst, with OceanFirst surviving; and (iii) immediately thereafter, Cape Bank merged with and into
OceanFirst Bank, with OceanFirst Bank surviving. The total consideration paid by OceanFirst in the Cape acquisition was
$196.4 million, including cash consideration of $30.5 million.

Note 2. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC. Certain information and certain footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, management believes that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based upon available information and certain
assumptions that OceanFirst and Sun believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A

final determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could not be made at the time that this
document was prepared, may differ materially from the preliminary estimates. The final valuation may change the purchase price
allocation, which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and could result in a change to the
unaudited pro forma combined financial statements.

Business Combination with Sun

With respect to the Transactions, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information assumes that the Transactions
will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with OceanFirst treated as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method
of accounting, the identifiable assets and identifiable liabilities of Sun, as of the effective date of the Transactions, will be recorded by
OceanFirst at their respective estimated fair values and the excess of the merger consideration over the fair value of Ocean Shore’s net
identifiable assets will be allocated to goodwill.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial condition as of June 30, 2017 reflects the Transactions assuming
that the Transactions became effective as of June 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial
condition has been adjusted to reflect the preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price to identifiable net assets acquired in the
Transactions. The estimated purchase price was calculated using the assumed OceanFirst share closing price of $24.88, which was the
volume-weighted average closing trading price of OceanFirst common stock on the NASDAQ for the five trading day period ending on
and including September 15, 2017, the latest practicable trading date before the date of this document. The final allocation of the
purchase price will be determined after the completion of the Transactions. This allocation is dependent upon certain valuations and
other studies that have not progressed to a stage where sufficient information is available to make a definitive allocation. The purchase
price allocation adjustments and related amortization reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are
preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of preparing these statements. The final allocation of the purchase price will be
determined after the Transactions are completed and after completion of a thorough analysis to determine the fair value of Ocean
Shore’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the date that the Transactions are completed.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements for the periods ending December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 reflect
the results of operations of OceanFirst giving effect to the Transactions as if they had become effective on January 1, 2016 and
January 1, 2017, respectively, and combines OceanFirst’s historical results for both such periods with the historical results of Sun.

OceanFirst expects to incur costs associated with integrating Sun. Unless indicated otherwise, the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements do not reflect nonrecurring transaction costs, the cost of any integration activities or the benefits that
may result from synergies that may be derived from any integration activities.

Business Combinations with Ocean Shore and Cape

The Ocean Shore acquisition, which was consummated on November 30, 2016, and the Cape acquisition, which was consummated on
May 2, 2016, were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with OceanFirst treated as the acquiror in each case.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the consideration paid by OceanFirst has been allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed of Ocean Shore and Cape based upon their estimated fair values, net of tax. The excess of consideration paid over
the fair values of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the period ending December 31, 2016 reflects the Ocean Shore
acquisition and the Cape acquisition as if such transactions had been consummated at the beginning of such period and combines
OceanFirst’s historical results for the year ended December 31, 2016 with historical results for the same period for Ocean Shore and
Cape. Such historical financial information of

Table of Contents

Cape and Ocean Shore was based upon information that was publicly filed with the SEC for the periods prior to the completion of the
Cape acquisition and the Ocean Shore acquisition, respectively, and on internal accounting records for the periods beginning on the
date on which each of the Cape acquisition (with respect to Cape’s historical financial information) and the Ocean Shore acquisition
(with respect to Ocean Shore’s historical financial information) was completed and, in each case, on December 31, 2016.

Unless indicated otherwise, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect nonrecurring transaction
costs, the cost of any integration activities or the benefits that may result from synergies that may be derived from any integration
activities.

(a) Adjustment reflects payment of transaction expenses of $31.5 million (which includes cash payments expected to be made to
certain Sun executive officers pursuant to the terms of the change in control agreements described in the section entitled “The
Transactions — Interests of Sun’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” beginning on page 80) and payment of
cash consideration of $72.5 million to Sun shareholders, representing $3.78 for each share of Sun common stock held by Sun
shareholders.

 

(b) Adjustment reflects elimination of Sun’s historical allowance for loan losses of $14.9 million, a fair value discount due to interest
rates of $13.1 million, net of deferred fees, and a fair value discount due to credit of $19.3 million.

 

(c) Adjustment reflects the fair value discount on premises and equipment.

Table of Contents

(d) Adjustment reflects the tax impact of pro forma accounting fair value adjustments. Also includes a preliminary estimate of
$23.7 million representing part of Sun’s unrecognized net operating loss carryforward for federal taxes which can be utilized by
OceanFirst. For more information regarding Sun’s deferred tax asset, see Sun’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017.

 

(e) Adjustment reflects the fair value of acquired core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is calculated as the present
value of the difference between a market participant’s cost of obtaining alternative funds and the cost to maintain the acquired
deposit base. Deposit accounts that are evaluated as part of the core deposit intangible include demand deposit, money market and
savings accounts.

 

(f) Adjustment reflects the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, net of Sun’s existing goodwill
balance. For purposes of these pro forma financial statements, the purchase price was calculated using the assumed OceanFirst
share closing price of $24.88, which was the volume-weighted average of the closing trading price of OceanFirst’s common stock
for the five trading day period ending on and including September 15, 2017, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The purchase price, as so calculated, is a preliminary estimate, and the final purchase price,
which will not be determined until the first-step merger is completed, will be based in part on the share price of OceanFirst on that
date. See “Note 3. Purchase Price Allocation” above for more information regarding the allocation of the estimated OceanFirst
purchase price.

 

(g) Adjustment reflects the fair value discount on time deposits which was calculated by discounting future contractual payments at a
current market interest rate.

 

(h) Adjustment reflects the fair value discount on borrowings which was calculated by discounting future contractual payments at a
current market interest rate.

 

(i) Adjustment reflects elimination of Sun’s historical allowance for off balance sheet liabilities.
 

(j) Adjustment reflects elimination of Sun’s historical stockholder’s equity and the issuance of shares of OceanFirst common stock
by OceanFirst as a component of the merger consideration.

 

(k) Interest income on loans was adjusted to reflect the difference between the contractual interest rate earned on loans and estimated
discount accretion over the remaining life of the acquired loans based on current market yields for similar loans.

 

(l) Interest income on securities was adjusted to reflect the difference between the contractual interest rate earned on securities and
estimated premium amortization over the remaining life of the securities based on current market yields for similar securities.

 

(m) Interest expense on deposits was adjusted to reflect the (amortization)/accretion of the time deposit fair value premium/discount
over the remaining life of the time deposits.

 

(n) Interest expense on borrowings was adjusted to reflect the (amortization)/accretion of the estimated fair value premium/discount
over the remaining life of the borrowings.

 

(o) Occupancy expense was adjusted to reflect the amortization/(accretion) of the fair market value premium/discount on premises
and equipment.

 

(p) Adjustment reflects the amortization of core deposit intangible over an estimated ten year useful life and calculated on a sum of
the years digits basis.

 

(q) Adjustment to remove the merger related expenses related to the Cape acquisition and the Ocean Shore acquisition.
 

(r) Adjustment reflects the tax impact of the pro forma purchase accounting adjustments.
 

(s) Adjustment reflects the conversion of weighted average shares (basic and diluted) into equivalent shares of OceanFirst common
stock based on the respective merger exchange ratios.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS’ RIGHTS

If the first-step merger is completed, Sun shareholders will have the option to elect to receive shares of OceanFirst common stock in the
first-step merger in exchange for their shares of Sun common stock. OceanFirst is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware,
and Sun is organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey. As a result of the first-step merger, Sun shareholders who receive the
stock consideration (either because they elect to receive stock consideration or because of the allocation and proration provisions of
the merger agreement) will become OceanFirst stockholders. Thus, following the integrated mergers, the rights of Sun shareholders
who become OceanFirst stockholders as a result of the integrated mergers will be governed by the corporate law of the State of
Delaware and will also then be governed by OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation and OceanFirst’s bylaws. OceanFirst’s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws will be unaltered by the Transactions.

The following is a summary of the material differences between (1) the current rights of Sun shareholders under the NJBCA, Sun’s
certificate of incorporation and Sun’s bylaws and (2) the current rights of OceanFirst stockholders under the DGCL, OceanFirst’s
certificate of incorporation and OceanFirst’s bylaws. OceanFirst and Sun believe that this summary describes the material differences
between the rights of OceanFirst stockholders as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the rights of Sun shareholders
as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; however, it does not purport to be a complete description of those differences.
Copies of OceanFirst’s and Sun’s governing documents have been filed with the SEC. To find out where copies of these documents can
be obtained, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on

OCEANFIRST   SUN

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation authorizes it to issue up to
55,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of
the OceanFirst record date, there were 32,562,477 shares of
OceanFirst common stock outstanding and no shares of OceanFirst
preferred stock outstanding.
 

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation further provides that the
number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or
decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
OceanFirst common stock, without a vote of the holders of the
preferred stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such
holders is required pursuant to the terms of any preferred stock
designation.   

Sun’s certificate of incorporation authorizes it to issue up to
40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share,
and up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00
per share. As of the Sun record date, there were 19,091,912
shares of Sun common stock outstanding, and no shares of Sun
preferred stock outstanding.
 

Sun’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the Sun board to
issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series.
The Sun board is authorized to divide the preferred stock into
series and to determine the designation, number, relative or
other special rights, preferences and limitations of any series of
preferred stock by board resolution or resolutions adopted from
time to time.

VOTING

Generally, each holder of OceanFirst common stock is entitled to one
vote per share and will not have any right to cumulate votes in the
election of directors. OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation
provides that stockholders who beneficially own in excess of 10% of
the then outstanding shares of OceanFirst common stock are not
entitled to any vote with respect to the shares held in excess of the
10% limit.   

Under Sun’s certificate of incorporation, the holders of the Sun
common stock exclusively possess all voting power and each
holder of shares of Sun common stock is entitled to vote one
vote for each share held by such holder.

OceanFirst shall be such number as designated by the OceanFirst
board from time to time, except in the absence of such designation

Under the merger agreement, OceanFirst has agreed to increase the
size of the OceanFirst board from twelve to fourteen members and
appoint two current members of the Sun board to the OceanFirst
board.   

Sun’s certificate of incorporation currently provides that the

Under OceanFirst’s bylaws, no director shall stand for re-election to
the OceanFirst board following his or her 72nd birthday.
 

OceanFirst’s bylaws further provide that each director is required to

serve on the OceanFirst board and at the same time be a director or
officer of another co-operative bank, credit union, savings bank,
savings and loan association, trust company, bank holding company
or banking association or any affiliate thereof.   

Under Sun’s bylaws, every director of Sun must be a

number of shares (if any) required by law in order to qualify as
a director. Any director shall immediately cease to be a director
when he or she no longer holds such shares.

TERM OF DIRECTORS

Under OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation, the directors are
divided into three classes, with the term of office that expire at the
third annual meeting of stockholders succeeding the annual meeting

Under Sun’s certificate of incorporation, the Sun directors hold
office until the next annual shareholders meeting succeeding
the annual shareholders meeting at which such director was

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

There is no provision in the OceanFirst organizational documents for
the removal of directors by the OceanFirst board.
 

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation provides that any director,

holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of capital stock of OceanFirst entitled to vote

power to remove directors for cause and to suspend directors
pending a final determination that cause exists for removal.
Additionally, under Sun’s certificate of incorporation, any
director or the entire board of directors of Sun may be removed
with or without cause, at any time, by the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Sun capital stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Under OceanFirst’s bylaws, subject to the rights of the holders of
any class or series of preferred stock of OceanFirst, special meetings
of OceanFirst stockholders may be called only by the board of
directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the
directors that OceanFirst would have if there were no vacancies on
the board of directors.
 

OceanFirst’s bylaws provide that at any special meeting of the
stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have
been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of
directors.
 

The DGCL does not grant stockholders the statutory right to call a
special meeting.

  

Under Sun’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, except as
otherwise required by law, special meetings of the shareholders
for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the
Sun board.
 

Notwithstanding the fact that Sun’s bylaws do not permit Sun
shareholders to call a special meeting, Section 14A:5-3 of the
NJBCA provides that upon the application of the holder or
holders of not less than ten percent of all the shares entitled to
vote at a meeting, the Superior Court of the State of New
Jersey (the “Superior Court”) may for good cause order a
special meeting of the shareholders to be called and held at
certain time and place, upon such notice and for the transaction
of such business as may be designated in such order. At any
such meeting, the shareholders present in person or by proxy
and having voting powers will constitute a quorum for the
transaction of the business designated in the order of the
Superior Court.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Under OceanFirst’s bylaws, subject to the rights of the holders of
any class or series of preferred stock of OceanFirst, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of OceanFirst
must be effected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of
OceanFirst and may not be effected by any consent in writing by
such stockholders.

  

Under the NJBCA and Sun’s certificate of incorporation, any
action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders at
a meeting may be taken without a meeting if all of the
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting consent to such
action in writing.
 

In the case of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of all capital
shares of Sun or sale of assets, such action may be taken
without a meeting only if all shareholders consent in writing, or
if all of the shareholders entitled to vote consent in writing and
all other shareholders are provided the advance notification
required by Section 14A: 5-6(2)(b) of the NJBCA. All other
acts by written consent that are not unanimous are prohibited
by Sun’s certificate of incorporation.

OCEANFIRST   SUN

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS

Under the DGCL, a stockholder of a Delaware corporation generally
has the right to dissent from a merger or consolidation in which the
corporation is participating or a sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the corporation, subject to specified procedural
requirements. The DGCL does not confer appraisal rights, however,
if the corporation’s stock is either (a) listed on a national securities
exchange or designated as a national market system security on an
interdealer quotation system by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.; or (b) held of record by more than 2,000
holders. The DGCL further provides that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the
vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided
under DGCL Section 251(f).   

The NJBCA provides that a shareholder is not entitled to
demand the fair value of his or her shares of stock in any
transaction if, among other things, the stock is listed on a
national securities exchange, if cash is to be received, or the
securities to be received are listed on a national securities
exchange. Because Sun’s common stock is listed on the
NASDAQ, the holders of Sun’s common stock are not entitled
to dissenters’ rights.

EVALUATION OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

The OceanFirst certificate of incorporation does not mandate that the
OceanFirst board consider certain prescribed factors when evaluating
a business combination, tender offer or exchange offer (and other
similar transactions). However, the OceanFirst certificate of
incorporate does permit the OceanFirst board to, when evaluating
such transactions, consider all relevant factors, including those
factors that the directors of any subsidiary of OceanFirst may
consider in evaluating any action that may result in a change or
potential change in the control of such subsidiary, and the social and
economic effect of acceptance of such offer on OceanFirst’s present
and future customers and employees and those of its subsidiaries; on
the communities in which OceanFirst and its subsidiaries operate or
are located; on the ability of OceanFirst to fulfill its corporate
objective as a savings and loan holding company under applicable
laws and regulations; and on the ability of its subsidiary savings
bank to fulfill the objectives of a federally-chartered stock form
savings bank under applicable statutes and regulations.

  

Under Sun’s certificate of incorporation, when evaluating a
business combination or a tender or exchange offer, in
connection with the exercise of its judgement in determining
what is in the best interests of Sun and the Sun shareholders,
the Sun board is required to consider the following factors (in
addition to considering the adequacy of the amount to be paid
in connection with any such transaction and any other factors
which the Sun board deems relevant): (i) the long-term as well
as short-term interests of Sun and its shareholders; (ii) the
social and economic effects of entering into the transaction on
Sun and its subsidiaries, and its present and future employees,
depositors, loan and other customers, creditors and other
elements of the communities in which Sun and its subsidiaries
operate or are located; (iii) the business and financial condition
and earnings prospects of the acquiring person or entity,
including, but not limited to, debt service and other existing
financial obligations, financial obligations to be incurred in
connection with the acquisition, and other likely financial
obligations of the acquiring person or entity, and the possible
effect of such conditions upon Sun and its subsidiaries and the
other elements of the communities in which Sun and its
subsidiaries operate or are located; and (iv) the competence,
experience, and integrity of the acquiring person or entity and
its or their management.

RESPONSE TO ABUSIVE TAKEOVERS

The OceanFirst certificate of incorporation does not specifically
address how the OceanFirst board should respond to certain abusive
takeovers.

  

Sun’s certificate of incorporation provides that the Sun board
(or any committee thereof) is expressly authorized, to the
extent permitted by law, to take such action or actions as the
Sun board or such committee may determine to be reasonably
necessary or desirable to (A) encourage any person to enter
into negotiations with the Sun board and management of Sun
with respect to any transaction which may result in a change in
control of Sun which is proposed or initiated by such person or
(B) contest or oppose any such transaction which the Sun board
or such committee determines to be unfair, abusive or
otherwise undesirable with respect to Sun and its business,
assets or properties or the shareholders of Sun, including,
without limitation, the adoption of such plans or the issuance of
such rights, options, capital stock, notes, debentures or other
evidences of indebtedness or other securities of Sun, which
rights, options, capital stock, notes, evidences of indebtedness
and other securities (i) may be exchangeable for or convertible
into cash or other securities on such terms and conditions as
may be determined by the Sun board or such committee and
(ii) may provide for the treatment of any holder or class of
holders thereof designated by the sun board or any such
committee in respect of the terms, conditions, provisions and
rights of such securities which is different from, and unequal
to, the terms, conditions, provisions and rights applicable to all
other holders thereof.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

OceanFirst has not opted out of the requirements of Section 203 of
the DGCL, which provides that OceanFirst is prohibited from
engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (a
person or group of affiliates owning at least fifteen percent of the
voting power of OceanFirst) for a period of three years after such
interested stockholder became an interested stockholder unless
(a) before the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the
OceanFirst board approved either the business combination or the
transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested
stockholder, (b) upon consummation of the transaction which
resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the
interested stockholder owned at least eighty-five percent of the
voting stock of

the NJBCA, which provides that Sun is prohibited from
engaging in business combinations with interested
shareholders, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to
Section 14A:10A-4 of the NJBCA, Sun is prohibited from
engaging in a business combination with an interested
shareholder for a period of five years following the interested
shareholder becoming such unless (a) the business combination
is approved by the Sun board prior to the stock acquisition date
or (b) the transaction or series of related transactions which
caused the person to become an interested shareholder was
approved by the Sun board prior to that shareholder’s stock
acquisition date and any subsequent business

also officers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee
participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether
shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or

became an interested stockholder the business combination is
approved by the OceanFirst board and authorized by the affirmative
vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is
not owned by the interested stockholder at an annual or special
meeting of the stockholders of OceanFirst.
 

In addition, OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation provides that a
business combination with an interested stockholder requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of
the then-outstanding shares of stock of voting stock of OceanFirst.
The super-majority vote is not required for a business combination
with an interested stockholder that is approved by a majority of
disinterested directors or meets certain consideration value
requirements. An interested stockholder is defined as any person
who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of
OceanFirst’s voting stock; an affiliate or associate of OceanFirst
who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in
question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting
power of the then outstanding voting stock of OceanFirst; or an
assignee of shares of voting stock which were at any time within the
two-year period immediately prior to the date in question

such subsequent business combination is approved by (i) the

who are not employees, officers, directors, stockholders,
affiliates or associates of the interested stockholder and (ii) the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting stock
not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder at a
meeting called for such purpose. In addition to the foregoing
restrictions, pursuant to Section 14A:10A-5 of the NJBCA, Sun
is prohibited, at any time, from engaging in any business
combination with any interested shareholder other than (i) a
business combination approved by the Sun board prior to the
interested shareholder’s stock acquisition date; (ii) a business
combination approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of
two-thirds of the voting stock not beneficially owned by such
interested shareholder at a meeting called for such purpose;
(iii) a business combination in which certain consideration
requirements are met and the interested shareholder has not
become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of stock
of Sun after the interested shareholder’s stock acquisition date
and prior to the consummation date with respect to the business
combination, subject to certain exceptions; or (iv) a business
combination approved by (x) the Sun board, or a committee
thereof, consisting solely of persons who are not employees,
officers, directors, stockholders, affiliates or associates of that
interested stockholder prior to the consummation of the

holders of a majority of the voting stock not beneficially owned
by such interested stockholder at a meeting called for such
purpose if the transaction or series of related transactions with
the interested stockholder which caused the person to become
an interested stockholder was approved by the Sun board prior
to the consummation of such transaction or series of related
transactions. Under New Jersey law, an interested shareholder
is defined as any person who (i) beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of Sun’s
outstanding voting stock or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of
Sun who, at any time within the five-year period prior to the

shareholder’s stock acquisition date unless the business
combination is approved by the board of directors prior to the
interested shareholder’s stock acquisition date. In addition, Sun
shall not engage in any business combination with any
interested shareholder of Sun at any time unless one of the
following three conditions are met: (1) the business
combination is approved by the Sun board prior to that
interested shareholder’s stock acquisition date and thereafter
approved by shareholders in accordance with applicable law;
(2) the business combination is approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting stock not

requirements are met and the interested shareholder has not
become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of stock
of Sun after the interested shareholder’s stock acquisition date

directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of
Sun’s outstanding voting stock; (ii) is an affiliate or associate
of Sun who, at any time within the five-year period prior to the

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation provides that OceanFirst’s
directors shall not be liable to OceanFirst or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except
for liability: (a) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty;
(b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (c) under
Section 174 of the DGCL; or (d) for any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit.

  

Sun’s certificate of incorporation provides that an officer or
director of Sun shall not have, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any personal liability to Sun or its shareholders for
damages for breach of any duty owed to Sun or its
shareholders, except for liability for any breach of duty based
upon an act or omission (a) in breach of the director’s or
officer’s duty of loyalty to Sun or its shareholders, (b) not in
good faith or involving a knowing violation of law or
(c) resulting in receipt by such person of an improper personal
benefit.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND INSURANCE

OceanFirst’s certificate of incorporation provides that OceanFirst
shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any legal proceeding by reason of the fact that such
person (a) is or was a director or officer of OceanFirst or (b) is or
was serving at the request of OceanFirst as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an
employee benefit plan; provided, however, that OceanFirst shall not
indemnify or agree to indemnify any of the foregoing persons
against liability or expenses if he or she has not met the applicable
standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. OceanFirst’s
certificate of incorporation further provides that OceanFirst may
maintain insurance to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of OceanFirst, any subsidiary or affiliate of
OceanFirst or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not
OceanFirst would have the power to indemnify such person against
such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.   

Sun’s bylaws provide that Sun shall indemnify to the fullest
extent permitted by Section 14A:3-5 of the NJBCA every
person who is or was a director or officer of: (a) Sun; (b) any
other enterprise, if serving as such at the request of Sun; or
(c) the legal representative of any officer or director described
in preceding clause (a) or (b). In all situations in which
indemnification is not mandatory, Sun may, to the fullest extent
permitted by Section 14A:3-5 of the NJBCA, indemnify all
persons whom it is empowered to indemnify pursuant thereto;
provided, however, that the Sun board’s exercise of
indemnification powers is limited by and conditioned upon the
Sun board’s determination that such indemnification would be
in the best interests of Sun. The Sun board’s determination
whether to provide indemnification shall be conclusive in the
absence of clear and convincing evidence of bad faith.

INSPECTION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS

Under DGCL Sections 219 and 220, any stockholder of a Delaware
corporation may examine the list of stockholders and any
stockholder making a written demand may inspect any other
corporate books and records for any purpose reasonably related to

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 30, 2017 (this “Agreement”), is by and among OceanFirst
Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), Mercury Merger Sub Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and Sun Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the “Company”).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of the Company have each determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective companies and the shareholders of their respective companies for such companies to consummate the
strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Company (the “First-Step Merger”), so that the Company is the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) immediately thereafter, the Company, as the
surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, will merge (the “Second-Step Merger” and, together with the First-Step Merger, the
“Integrated Mergers”) with and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such
capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”);

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single
integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections
354, 361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury regulation section 1.368-2(g);

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and an inducement for Parent to enter
into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have simultaneously herewith entered into separate voting and support
agreements with Parent (collectively, the “Support Agreements”) in connection with the First-Step Merger; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Integrated
Mergers and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Integrated Mergers.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE INTEGRATED MERGERS

1.1 The Integrated Mergers; Effective Time.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the New Jersey Business Corporation
Act (the “BCA”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the First-Step Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of New Jersey. Upon
consummation of the First-Step Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate. On or before the Closing Date,
Parent and the Company, respectively, shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of New
Jersey (the “New Jersey Secretary”) in accordance with the BCA (the “First-Step Merger Certificate”). The First-Step Merger shall
become effective as of the date and time specified in the First-Step Merger Certificate (such date and time, the “Effective Time”).

Table of Contents

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance
with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and the BCA, the Company, as the surviving corporation in the First-Step
Merger, shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Second-Step Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Second-Step Merger, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall terminate. On or before the Closing Date, Parent and the Company, respectively, shall cause to be filed
a certificate of ownership and merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary”) in accordance
with the DGCL and a certificate of merger with the New Jersey Secretary in accordance with the BCA (collectively, the “Second-Step
Merger Certificates”). The Second-Step Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Second-Step Merger
Certificates.

1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Integrated Mergers (the “Closing”)
will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, on the first business
day that is both (x) the last business day of a month or, if the Closing is anticipated to occur in January, the first business day of the
month of January solely to the extent that the parties are able to, on such date and at or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City Time, submit
and confirm acceptance of the filing of the First-Step Merger Certificate with the New Jersey Secretary and the Second-Step Merger
Certificate with the Delaware Secretary and (y) no earlier than the third (3rd) business day after the date on which the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof have been satisfied or, if permitted by applicable law, waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed
to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, further, however, that the Closing shall not occur prior to January 1, 2018 unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
“Closing Date.”

1.3 Effects of the Integrated Mergers. At and after the Effective Time, the First-Step Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 10-6 of the BCA. At and after the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, the Second-Step Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and Section 10-6 of the BCA.

1.4 Effects of First-Step Merger on Merger Sub Capital Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of the capital
stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Company.

1.5 Conversion of Company Common Stock in the First-Step Merger. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First-Step
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to Section 2.4(e), each share of the common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company (the
“Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common
Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by the Company or Parent (in each case, other than shares of
Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit Plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like,
or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) (collectively, the “Exception Shares”),
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive the following, without
interest:

(i) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (a “Cash
Election”) has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively, the “Cash
Election Shares”), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration (the “Cash Consideration”);

Table of Contents

(ii) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive Parent Common Stock
(a “Stock Election”) has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively, the
“Stock Election Shares”), a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Parent (such common stock, the “Parent Common Stock”) equal to the Exchange Ratio (such number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, the “Stock Consideration”); and

(iii) For each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election
has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively, the “Non-Election Shares”), the right to
receive such Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 2.3.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meaning:

(i) The “Exchange Ratio” means the quotient, rounded to the nearest one-ten thousandth, of (A) the Per Share
Cash Consideration divided by (B) the Parent Share Closing Price.

(ii) The “Parent Share Closing Price” means the volume-weighted average trading price of Parent Common Stock
on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “NASDAQ”) (as reported by The Wall Street Journal) for the five (5) full trading
days ending on the last trading day preceding the Closing Date.

(iii) The “Per Share Cash Consideration” means the sum, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, of (A) $3.78
and (B) the product, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, of 0.7884 times the Parent Share Closing Price.

(iv) The “Merger Consideration” means the Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration described in
Section 1.5(a), as applicable.

(c) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate”, it being understood that any reference herein to “Old Certificate” shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger
Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Section 1.5(a) and this Article II, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and Section 2.4(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b). Old Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
exchanged for evidence of shares in book entry form or, at Parent’s option, certificates (collectively, referred to herein as “New
Certificates”), representing the Stock Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu
of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) and/or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, upon the surrender of such Old
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.4, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by the Company or Parent (in each case, other than the Exception

Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

1.6 Effects of Second-Step Merger on Parent and Company Common Stock. At the effective time of the Second-Step
Merger, each share of (a) Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Second-Step Merger and (b) common stock of the Company, as the surviving corporation
in the First-Step Merger, issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither
the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.7 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
the Company’s Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, the Company’s 2014 Performance Equity Plan, the Company’s 2010 Stock Based-
Incentive Plan or the Company’s 2004 Stock Based-Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (each, a “Company Equity Plan”), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Stock Option”) shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an option to purchase from Parent, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio,
at a per share exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the per share exercise
price for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so
adjusted, a “Converted Company Option”). All rounding described in this Section 1.7(a) shall be done on an aggregate basis for each
Converted Company Option, such that a single rounding of shares and exercise price shall be applied to each Converted Company
Option.

(b) The Converted Company Options shall have the same vesting schedule (including any acceleration of vesting as
provided in the applicable Company Equity Plan) as the Company Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same terms and
conditions as such Company Stock Options; provided, that Parent shall assume and convert the Company Stock Options into
Converted Company Options in a manner consistent with the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code, as applicable.
After such assumption and conversion, the Converted Company Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the
applicable Company Equity Plan and grant agreements under which the Company Stock Options were originally issued (including any
applicable change in control or other accelerated vesting provisions).

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock granted under
any Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Restricted Stock Award”) shall be
or become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock subject thereto as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter). Each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes of this Article II.
The Company or Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required or permitted to be deducted and
withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local Tax laws as allowed under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the
applicable grant agreement, which withholding shall be taken first from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Company Restricted Stock Award (if any) and then, to the extent necessary, the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such Company Restricted Stock Award in the form of Parent Common Stock.

(d) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Company Common Stock granted
under any Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award” and, together with the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards, the “Company Equity Awards”), shall
be cancelled in full, and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange for each share of
Company Common Stock subject thereto as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five
(5) business days thereafter); provided that, to the extent payment of the Merger Consideration at such time would result in accelerated
taxation and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not
trigger such accelerated taxation and/or penalties. Each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit Awards shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes of this Article II. The Company or
Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required or permitted to be deducted and withheld under the
Code and any applicable state or local Tax laws as allowed under the applicable Company Equity Plan and grant agreement, which
withholding shall be taken first from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award (if any) and then, to the extent necessary, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award in the form of Parent Common Stock.

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and its compensation
committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to (i) effectuate the provisions
of this Section 1.7, (ii) ensure that following the Effective Time, there are no obligations with respect to the Company Equity Awards
other than as set forth in this Section 1.7 and (iii) solely for purposes of granting new Company Equity Awards, terminate each
Company Equity Plan effective as of the Effective Time; provided, that no action taken by the Company shall be required to be
irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of each Converted Company Option issued pursuant to Section 1.7(a). Immediately
following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other applicable form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Converted Company Option and shall
use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Converted Company Options remain outstanding.

1.8 Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the surviving corporation in
the First-Step Merger until such Certificate of Incorporation is thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law. At
the effective time of the Second-Step Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent (the “Parent Certificate”), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with its terms and applicable law.

1.9 Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Merger Sub Bylaws”), shall be the Bylaws of the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger until thereafter

corporation in the First-Step Merger until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. Subject to
Section 6.12, the directors and officers of Parent in office immediately prior to the effective time of the Second-Step Merger shall be
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

1.11 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (a) the parties intend that (i) the Integrated Mergers shall
together be treated as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b)
of the Code, and (b) this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections
354, 361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

1.12 Bank Merger. Immediately following the consummation of the Integrated Mergers, Sun National Bank, a national bank
and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (“Company Bank”), will merge (the “Bank Merger”) with and into OceanFirst Bank, a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Parent Bank”), pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger attached hereto as Exhibit A, dated
as of the date hereof, by and between Company Bank and Parent Bank (the “Bank Merger Agreement”). Parent Bank shall be the
surviving bank in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company Bank shall cease.
The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the effective time of the Second-Step Merger. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause Company Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such articles of
combination and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (the “Bank Merger
Certificate”) immediately following the effective time of the Second-Step Merger.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 Proration.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock to be entitled to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a) shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the Cash
Component (as defined below) divided by (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (such quotient, the “Cash Conversion Number”). All
other shares of Company Common Stock (excluding the shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in
Section 1.5(d)) shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. As used in this Agreement, “Cash Component”
means the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding the shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 1.5(d)) and (y) $3.78. The
aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration shall in no event exceed the Cash Component.

(b) Promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the
Stock Consideration as follows:

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have
been made (the “Cash Election Number”) exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election
Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a

fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election
Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder’s Cash Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash
Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the “Shortfall Number”), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock
Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of
each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of
Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the
total number of Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether
fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder’s
Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election
Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down),
with the remaining number of such holder’s Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

2.2 Election Procedures.

(a) Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Section 2.1 (a “Holder”) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 2.2, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures.

(b) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2 (herein called an
“Election”) (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to
make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

(c) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, including appropriate and customary
transmittal materials in such form as prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Form of Election”), so as to
permit Holders to exercise their right to make an Election.

(d) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election not less than twenty (20) business days
prior to the anticipated Election Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing date, and (ii) following such
mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as

Table of Contents

promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The
time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as the “Election Period”.

(e) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, during the Election
Period, a Form of Election properly completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the Form of
Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States. As used herein, unless otherwise
agreed in advance by the parties, “Election Deadline” means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
Exchange Agent is located) on the date which the parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business days preceding the
Closing Date. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the
date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election
Deadline.

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke such Holder’s Election by written
notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of
Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (none of Parent, the Company
nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in
effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election
Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

(g) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Old Certificates, or of
the guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be automatically
deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(h) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable, good
faith discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the
validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the method of
issuance and delivery of New Certificates representing the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of
Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

2.3 Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”),
for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates representing the
aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.4(a) and (b) cash in an amount
sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
amount of the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates and any shortfall as a result of investment losses shall be
promptly replenished by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

2.4 Exchange of Shares.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
which such holder shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 1.5(a) and this Article II, and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.4(b). From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder
of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate
representing the Stock Consideration to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in
accordance with, and subject to, Section 1.5(a), and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the Cash Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates in accordance with, and subject to,
Section 1.5(a) and this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old
Certificates or any dividends payable under Section 2.4(b). Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4, each Old Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.4.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After
the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable after the Closing Date with
respect to the Stock Consideration which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing
shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is
entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Share Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
former share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct
and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent, the posting by such person
of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Old Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

qualify (A) any other section of Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (B) other sections of Article III to the extent
it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Company Reports publicly filed by the Company after
December 31, 2016, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,”
or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1 Corporate Organization.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
New Jersey and is a bank holding company duly registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal
Reserve Board”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The Company has the corporate power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this
clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws,
rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as
well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally or (D) public disclosure of the
transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that are taken with the prior
written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B)
and (C), to the extent that the effects of such changes are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such
party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used
in this Agreement, the word “Subsidiary,” when used with respect to any person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, bank or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which (x) such first person directly or
indirectly owns or controls at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or others performing similar functions or (y) such first person is or directly or indirectly has the
power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing member or others performing similar functions. True, correct and complete
copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “Company Certificate”) and the Second
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Company Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

(b) Company Bank is a national bank duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
United States. The deposits of Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. Company
Bank is a member in good

standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLB”) and owns the requisite amount of stock therein.

(c) Without duplication of the representations made by the Company in Section 3.1(b), each Subsidiary of the
Company (each, a “Company Subsidiary”), (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization,
(ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, is in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or
distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list
of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

3.2 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 40,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00 par value, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are (i) 19,060,593 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) 73,222 shares of Company
Common Stock held in treasury, (iii) 556,694 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the
outstanding Company Stock Options, (iv) 212,970 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding in respect of Company Restricted

Restricted Stock Unit Awards (including, for purposes of this Section 3.2, 53,420 shares of Company Common Stock subject to

Company’s Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the “Directors’ Deferred Fee Plan”) and (vi) no other shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of any “gross-up” or similar preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that
have the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote. Except for the Trust Preferred Securities (as
defined below) and the Subordinated Debentures (as defined below), there are no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries issued or outstanding. Other than the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Stock
Awards and the Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards, in each case, issued either prior to the date of this Agreement or, to the extent
expressly permitted by this Agreement, on or after the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the

Parent or the Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would that would reasonably be

Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Integrated Mergers, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals from (x) the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC and (y) any other
approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 which are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger (which may include, at Parent’s election, conversion of the Parent Bank from a
federal savings bank to a national bank and registration of Parent as a bank holding company (collectively, the “National Bank
Conversion”)).

Mergers and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of Parent, access, during normal business hours during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, to all of the Company’s properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel,
information technology systems and records. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in preparing to execute after the Effective Time
conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, during normal business hours and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with normal business
operations of the Company, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by the Company during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents which the Company is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning the Company’s business, properties and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any material interference with Company’s
regular business operations during any such access. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of the Company’s customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions
of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Parent shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries
or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
mutual nondisclosure agreement, dated June 5, 2017, between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or
waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

6.3 Shareholders’ Approvals.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the
“Parent Meeting” and the “Company Meeting,” respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote required in connection with this
Agreement, the First-Step Merger and the Parent Share Issuance and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type
customarily brought before a special meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement or otherwise approve the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable and on the same date.

(b) The Board of Directors of each of Parent (except in the case of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change that
the Board of Directors of Parent is permitted to make under Section 6.3(c)) and the Company (except in the case of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change that the Board of Directors of the Company is permitted to make under Section 6.3(d)) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Parent and the Company, as the case may be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the
case of Parent, and the Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the Company, including by communicating to its respective
shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that such

shareholders approve (i) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the case of the Company, and (ii) the Parent
Share Issuance, in the case of Parent.

(c) Subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend approval of the Parent Share Issuance, then in
submitting the Parent Share Issuance to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of Parent may (but shall not be required to) withhold,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company or submit the Parent Share Issuance to Parent’s shareholders without a
recommendation (each, a “Parent Adverse Recommendation Change”) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Parent may communicate the basis for its lack
of a recommendation to Parent’s shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; provided, that the Board of Directors of Parent may not take any actions under this Section 6.3(c) unless
(i) Parent gives the Company at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action and (ii) at the end of such notice period,
the Board of Directors of Parent takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the Company (it
being understood that the Company shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement), and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.

(d) Subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely
to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this
Agreement to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may (but shall not be required to) withhold, withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent or submit this Agreement to the Company’s shareholders without recommendation (each, a “Company
Adverse Recommendation Change”) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Company’s
shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided,
that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take any actions under this Section 6.3(d) unless (i) if such action is taken in
response to an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of Section 6.13 and such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company gives Parent at least three (3) business days’ prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, if such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, its basis for determining that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (including the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third
party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other
events or circumstances)); and (iii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent (it being understood that Parent shall not have any obligation to
propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), and after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement (and, if
such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal). Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3(d) and will
require a new determination and notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3(d).

(e) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may
be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Parent or the Company, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote or the Requisite Company Vote except that (i) Parent shall not
be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting in the case of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change that is permitted under
Section 6.3(c) and (ii) the Company shall not be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting in the case of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change that is permitted under Section 6.3(d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the Parent Meeting and the Company Meeting shall be convened
and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of Parent and the Company at the Parent Meeting and the Company
Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the Parent Share Issuance, as applicable, and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Parent or the Company of such
obligation. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Meeting or the Company Meeting, as applicable, two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(e).

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable, (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with
the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and
any other third party that is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Integrated Mergers, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger to
be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 Employee Matters.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed
by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation) immediately following the Effective Time (a
“Continuing Employee”), while employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (and thereafter in the case of
compensation or benefits payable following a termination of employment), with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that
is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short- and long-term incentive compensation opportunities
(excluding equity and equity-based compensation) that, in each case, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the short- and
long-term incentive compensation opportunities provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits (other than severance benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other compensation and employee benefits provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the immediately preceding
sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee
whose employment terminates during the 12-month period following the Effective Time with severance benefits equal to the greater of
(A) the severance

benefits for which such Continuing Employee was eligible as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the severance benefits
for which employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries who are similarly situated to such Continuing Employee would be eligible under the
severance plans or policies of Parent or its Affiliates, in each case, determined without taking into account any reduction after the
Effective Time in the compensation paid to such Continuing Employee.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide
each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service
was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing service
recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes
of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan
or provides grandfathered benefits.

(c) Effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms, including terms related to the
amendment or termination thereof. Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the
applicable Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

(d) Unless Parent requests otherwise in writing, effective prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate the Sun
National Bank 401(k) Plan (the “Terminated Plan”). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with resolutions
adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors terminating the Terminated Plan, which shall provide for vesting of any accrued but
unvested benefits under the Terminated Plan and the payment of any then unpaid employer matching contributions in respect of the
year in which the Closing occurs, the form and substance of which shall be subject to the review of Parent, whose comments shall be
considered by the Company in good faith. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, with respect to the Terminated Plan,
Parent shall permit or cause its Subsidiaries (including Parent Bank) to permit the Continuing Employees to (i) roll over their account
balances and outstanding loan balances, if any, thereunder into a Tax-qualified “eligible retirement plan” within the meaning of
Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Code maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including Parent Bank) (the “Parent Retirement Plan”) and
(ii) reinvest the proceeds of any holdings in a Company Common Stock fund that were liquidated in connection with the Effective
Time into a Parent Common Stock fund. Parent shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary to permit each Continuing
Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Terminated Plan as of the Effective Time to continue to make scheduled loan
payments to the Terminated Plan after it is terminated pending the distribution and rollover of the Continuing Employee’s account
balance from the Terminated Plan to the Parent Retirement Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent a loan offset
with respect to such outstanding loan.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the
Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the third sentence of
Section 9.9, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or
former employee, officer, director or independent contractor (or any spouse or dependent of such individual) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

6.7 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under the Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Company
Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to,
(i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
consideration and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case,
to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company
Certificate, the Company Bylaws or the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons
are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the
Company Bylaws, or the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company; provided, that, if requested by
Parent, the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form)
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Company Benefit Plans (provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof
by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation’s
good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, the Company, in consultation with Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year “tail” policy under the Company’s existing directors and officers insurance
policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for
an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed, on an annual basis, the Premium Cap. If a “tail policy” is purchased as provided
above, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in full force and effect and not cancel such policy.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction,
then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company under this Section 6.7 shall not be
terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit
of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party.

6.8 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the
Company, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities
and franchises of any of the parties to the Integrated Mergers, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

6.9 Advice of Changes. Parent and the Company shall each promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) advise the other
party of any change or event (a) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) which it believes
would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of any condition set
forth in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be
deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice or give rise to any right of termination under
Article VIII, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied. The delivery and content of any such notice shall not limit or otherwise affect any right or remedy
under this Agreement (including under Article VII) of the party receiving such notice.

6.10 Litigation and Claims. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any action,
arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, dispute, proceeding, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought,
conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of either
such party, threatened against the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
any actions taken or to be taken by Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto or (b) seeks to
enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate at Parent’s own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors,
officers or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall not agree to any such
settlement without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.11 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other the
declaration of any dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates
relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or
fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common
Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the First-Step Merger.

6.12 Corporate Governance. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall (a) increase the size of the Board of Directors of
Parent to fourteen (14) members and, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, take such actions as may be necessary to
increase the size of the Board of Directors of Parent Bank to fourteen (14) members and (b) appoint two (2) current members of the
Board of Directors of the Company, to be selected by the Leadership Committee of Parent in consultation with the Board of Directors
of Parent and the Board of Directors of the Company, to the Boards of Directors of Parent and Parent Bank; provided, that (i) if, prior
to the two year anniversary of the Closing. any such appointee resigns from such directorship, then the Leadership Committee of
Parent shall select a current member of the Board of Directors of the Company as a candidate to fill the vacancy created by such
resignation and shall put forth such candidate for consideration by the Board of Directors of Parent in accordance with Section 2 of
Article II of the Parent Bylaws and (ii) Parent shall, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, take such actions as may be
necessary to appoint such individual to the Board of Directors of Parent Bank. Each such appointee shall be appointed to a class of the
Boards of Directors of Parent and Parent Bank to be selected by Parent in its discretion (provided that such appointees shall be
allocated among the classes as evenly as possible) and each individual who is selected to fill a vacancy in accordance with the proviso
set forth in this Section 6.12 shall be appointed to the class of the Board of Directors of Parent and Parent Bank in which such vacancy
exists.

6.13 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents,
advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except, for purposes of this clause (iii), to notify such person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 6.13(a); provided, that, for purposes of this clause (iii), prior to the date of receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.13(a), it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in
good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information or data or participating in any discussions, in each case, permitted pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the
Company shall have provided such information or data to Parent and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third
party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such
person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any
person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to
(x) enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (y) within ten (10) business days
after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other than
Parent) pursuant to such agreement. Promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall advise Parent of
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person
making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, copies of any written Acquisition Proposal and written summaries of any material oral
communications relating to an Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

(b) As used in this Agreement,

(i) “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer,
proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in; (A) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect,
of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25%
of the consolidated assets of the Company; (B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities
of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of the Company; or (C) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company); and

(ii) “Superior Proposal” shall mean any bona fide written offer or proposal made by a third party for an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company’s Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) (A) would, if consummated, result in the
acquisition of substantially all, but not less than substantially all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; (B) would result in a transaction that (1) involves consideration
to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the
consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things,
the nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing
of the proposed transaction beyond, or in addition to, those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing and (2) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company than the Integrated Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (C) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying with
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such Rules will in no way
eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.14 Board of Directors and Committee Meetings. Following receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, the Company
shall permit representatives of Parent and Parent Bank to attend any meeting of its Board of Directors or the executive and loan
committees thereof as an observer, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that the Company shall not be required to
permit such representatives to remain present during any confidential discussions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or any Acquisition Proposal or during any other matter (a) that the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably
determined to be confidential with respect to the participation of Parent or Parent Bank or (b) that the Company would not be required
to disclose under Section 6.2 of this Agreement.

6.15 Loan Participations. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent
with access to the originating lenders of the Loan Participations for the purpose of enabling Parent to conduct reasonable due diligence
on such Loan Participations; provided that Parent shall not contact or communicate with Loan Participants in any manner relating to
the Company or the Company’s business without the Company’s prior approval and the Company shall have the right to participate in
any such contact or communication.

Table of Contents

6.16 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to develop a joint
communications plan, to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan and, except in respect of (i) any announcement required by applicable law or
regulation, (ii) communications that are substantially similar to communications previously approved pursuant to this Section 6.16 or
(iii) communications (x) permitted by Section 6.3 or Section 6.13(c) or (y) required by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.17 Restructuring Efforts. If either the Company or Parent shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the
Requisite Parent Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for
herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or
kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner
adverse to such party or its shareholders or adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Integrated Mergers with respect to the Company’s
shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.17)
to its respective shareholders for approval.

6.18 Takeover Statutes. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that
would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Integrated Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Integrated Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.19 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Company and Parent agree that, in order to
most effectively compensate and retain the Company Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and the Company Equity Awards
in the First-Step Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.19. The Board of
Directors of Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case
of the Company) any dispositions of Company Common Stock or the Company Equity Awards by the officers and directors of the
Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Company Insiders”), and (in the case of
Parent) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Integrated Mergers, will
be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in
each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

6.20 Assumption of Company Debt. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on
behalf of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the Effective Time or at or prior to the
effective time for the Bank Merger for any debt of Company Bank, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and/or other
instruments required for the due assumption of the

Company’s or the Company Bank’s outstanding indebtedness, in each case, to the extent (i) such indebtedness is specifically disclosed
in the financial statements included in the Company Reports or otherwise is set forth in Section 6.20 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) such assumption is required by the terms of such indebtedness.

6.21 No Control of Other Party’s Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so
determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board;

(b) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of the Company, if (i) any Governmental
Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Integrated Mergers or the Bank Merger and such
denial has become final and nonappealable, or (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the Integrated Mergers or the Bank Merger,
unless, in either case, the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of the Company, if the Integrated Mergers
shall not have been consummated on or before the one (1) year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the “Termination Date”),

terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either the Board of Directors of Parent or the Board of Directors of the Company (provided, that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there

the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure
to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties
to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the
case of a termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within forty-five
(45) days following written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the
Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

(e) by the Board of Directors of the Company, prior to the time the Requisite Parent Vote is obtained, if the Board of

Share Issuance, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company, or resolved to do so,
or (ii) materially breached its obligations under Section 6.3; or

(f) by the Board of Directors of Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, or resolved to do so,
(ii) failed to recommend against acceptance of any publicly disclosed tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company
Common Stock (other than by Parent or an affiliate of Parent), within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (iii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition
Proposal or (iv) materially breached its obligations under Sections 6.3 or 6.13.

such termination is effected.

8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or
any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or knowing, intentional and material breach of any provision
of this Agreement (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock of the
economic benefits of the Integrated Mergers, including the loss of the premium offered to the shareholders of the Company).

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, (i) a bona fide

without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) as a result of a knowing and material breach by the Company occurring after the date of the Acquisition Proposal, and
(iii) on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to

the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire
transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $17,045,000 (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of clause (iii) of this
Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “25%” shall instead refer to “50%” and clause (C) of the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed followed by “as a result of which holders of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such transaction cease to own at least 50% of the common stock of the surviving or resulting company (or its ultimate parent)
immediately after such transaction.”

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company shall, on the
date of termination, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages and without limiting the rights of Parent
under Section 8.2(e), the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by the Company under this Section 8.2 shall be a fee equal to the
Termination Fee. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then Parent shall, on
the date of termination, pay the Company, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages and without limiting the
rights of the Company under Section 8.2(e), the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by Parent under this Section 8.2 shall be a
fee equal to the Termination Fee. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company, as applicable, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall pay the costs and expenses
of Parent or the Company (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), as applicable, in connection with such suit. In addition, if Parent or
the Company, as applicable, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then Parent or the Company, as applicable,
shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as announced by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or
any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Parent or the Company, as applicable, pursuant
to this Section 8.2 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the cause of fraud or a knowing, intentional and
material breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement specified in such section.

8.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Integrated Mergers by the shareholders of Parent and the shareholders of the Company; provided, however, that
after adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company or the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the shareholders
of Parent, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further
approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any matter except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally permitted, extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein;

that, after adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company or the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the
shareholders of Parent, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or
any portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver
or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition.

ARTICLE IX

Annex B

FORM OF
BROWN VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

This VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of June 30, 2017 (this “Agreement”), is by and among OceanFirst
Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and each of the undersigned shareholders (collectively, the “Shareholders” and
each, a “Shareholder”) of the Company (as defined below). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings
specified in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sun Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the
“Company”), Parent and Mercury Merger Sub Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Merger
Sub”), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “First-Step Merger”), with the Company
surviving as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) immediately thereafter, the Company, as the surviving corporation in the First-
Step Merger, will merge with and into Parent (the “Second-Step Merger” and, together with the First-Step Merger, the “Integrated
Mergers”), with Parent being the surviving corporation in the Second-Step Merger and (iii) at the Effective Time the shares of common
stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than certain shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent) will, without any further action
on the part of the holder thereof, be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in the
Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of, has the sole right to dispose of, and has
the sole right to vote the number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth below such Shareholder’s signature on the signature
page hereto (such Company Common Stock, together with any other capital stock of the Company acquired by any Shareholder after
the execution of this Agreement, whether acquired directly or indirectly, upon the exercise of options, conversion of convertible
securities or otherwise, and any other securities issued by the Company that are entitled to vote on the approval the Merger Agreement
held or acquired by any Shareholder (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter), being collectively referred to herein as the “Shares”;
provided, however, that shares of Company Common Stock held by The Brown Foundation shall not be considered Shares or
beneficially owned by any Shareholder and shall not be subject to the terms of this Agreement);

WHEREAS, receiving the Requisite Company Vote is a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and incur the obligations therein, Parent has required
that the Shareholders enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1.     Agreement to Vote; Restrictions on Voting and Transfers.

  (a)     Agreement to Vote the Shares. Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that from the
date hereof until the Expiration Time, at any meeting (whether annual or special and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the
Company’s shareholders, however called, each Shareholder will (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of such Shareholder’s
Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum and (ii) vote or cause to be voted all of such Shares, (A) in
favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, the First-Step Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (B) against any Acquisition Proposal, without regard to any recommendation to the shareholders of

Table of Contents

the Company by the Board of Directors of the Company concerning such Acquisition Proposal, and without regard to the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, or other proposal made in opposition to or that is otherwise in competition or inconsistent with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (C) against any agreement, amendment of any agreement or organizational document
(including the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws), or any other action that is intended or would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede, or interfere with, delay, postpone or discourage the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
(D) against any action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation of the Company in the Merger Agreement.

  (b)       Restrictions on Transfers. Each Shareholder hereby agrees that, from the date hereof until the earlier of the
receipt of the Requisite Company Vote or the Expiration Time, such Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, give,
pledge, grant a security interest in, encumber, assign, grant any option for the sale of or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Shares, or
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding to take any of the foregoing actions (each, a “Transfer”) other than a Transfer
for bona fide estate planning purposes to such Shareholder’s affiliates (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or immediate family
members (together, “Transferees”); provided that as a condition to such Transfer, such Transferee shall be required to execute a joinder
to this Agreement; provided, further, that such Shareholder shall remain jointly and severally liable for the breaches by any of such
Transferee of the terms hereof. Any Transfer in violation of this Section shall be null and void. Each Shareholder further agrees to
authorize and request the Company to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to all of the
Shares owned by such Shareholder and that this Agreement places limits on the Transfer of such Shareholder’s Shares.

  (c)       Transfer of Voting Rights. Each Shareholder hereby agrees that such Shareholder shall not deposit any Shares
in a voting trust, grant any proxy or power of attorney or enter into any voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement in
contravention of the obligations of such Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the Shares owned by such
Shareholder.

  (d)       Acquired Shares. Any Shares or other voting securities of the Company with respect to which beneficial
ownership is acquired by any Shareholder or any of their respective controlled affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include other family members other than such Shareholder’s spouse and children sharing the same household), including, without
limitation, by purchase, as a result of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification, exchange or change
of such Shares or upon exercise or conversion of any securities of the Company, if any, after the execution hereof (in each case, a
“Share Acquisition”) shall automatically become subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall become “Shares” for all purposes
hereof. If any controlled affiliate (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include other family members other than such
Shareholder’s spouse and children sharing the same household) of any Shareholder acquires Shares by way of a Share Acquisition,
such controlling Shareholder will cause such controlled affiliate to comply with the terms of this Agreement applicable to a
“Shareholder” of the Company.

  (e)       No Inconsistent Agreements. Each Shareholder hereby agrees that such Shareholder shall not enter into any
agreement, contract or understanding with any person prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, directly
or indirectly, to vote, grant a proxy or power of attorney or give instructions with respect to the voting of such Shareholder’s Shares in
any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement.

Section  2.       Non-Solicit. Each Shareholder shall not, and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective controlled affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include other family members other than such
Shareholder’s spouse and children sharing the same household) and each of their respective officers, directors, members, partners,
employees and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, encourage (including by providing information or
assistance) or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, any proposal that

the Integrated Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (f) initiate a shareholders’ vote or action by consent of
the Company’s shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (g) become a member of a “group” (as such term is used in

recommend, agree to or accept, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, investment
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal.

Section 3.       Representations, Warranties and Support Covenants of the Shareholders.

  (a)       Representations and Warranties. Each Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

     (i)     Power and Authority; Consents. For any Shareholder that is not an individual, such Shareholder is duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has all requisite power and
authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement. For each Shareholder that is an individual, such Shareholder
has the capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement. No filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity is necessary on the part of such Shareholder for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
such Shareholder or the consummation by such Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (ii)     Due Authorization. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Shareholder and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Shareholder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Shareholder.

     (iii)     Binding Agreement. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of such Shareholder, enforceable against such Shareholder in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies).

     (iv)     Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder does not, and
the performance by such Shareholder of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by such Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which such Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder or its
property or assets is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which such Shareholder or its property or assets is subject or, in the case
of any Shareholder that is not an individual, any charter, bylaw, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other
organizational document of such Shareholder. Except for this Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement, no Shareholder is,
and no controlled affiliate (which, for the avoidance of doubt,

any Shares. No Shareholder has appointed or granted a proxy or power of attorney to any person with respect to any Shares.

     (v)     Ownership of Shares. Except for restrictions in favor of Parent pursuant to this Agreement and transfer
restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the “blue sky” laws of the
various States of the United States, each Shareholder owns, beneficially and of record, all of the Shares free and clear of any proxy,
voting restriction, adverse claim, security interest, or other lien, and has sole voting power and sole power of disposition with respect to
such Shares with no restrictions on any Shareholder’s rights of voting or disposition pertaining thereto, and no person other than the
Shareholders have any right to direct or approve the voting or disposition of any of such Shareholder’s Shares. As of the date hereof,
the number of the Shares beneficially owned by such Shareholder is set forth below such Shareholder’s signature on the signature page
hereto. Each Shareholder has possession of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates representing all of such Shareholder’s
Shares (other than Shares held in book-entry form) and such certificate or certificates does or do not contain any legend or restriction
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

     (vi)  Legal Actions. There is no action, suit, investigation, complaint or other proceeding pending against any
Shareholder or, to the knowledge of such Shareholder, any other person or, to the knowledge of such Shareholder, threatened against
such Shareholder or any other person that restricts or prohibits (or, if successful, would restrict or prohibit) the exercise by Parent of its
rights under this Agreement or the performance by any party of its obligations under this Agreement.

     (vii)     Securities Purchase Agreement. No Shareholder has any outstanding claims against the Company,
and no Shareholder is aware of any claims that any Shareholder may have against the Company, in each case, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 7, 2010, as amended on July 30, 2010 (the “Securities
Purchase Agreement”), between the Company and the Shareholders, or any other contract to which any Shareholder is a party.

     (viii)     Reliance. Such Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger
Agreement in reliance upon such Shareholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of
such Shareholder contained herein.

  (b)       Support Covenants. From the date hereof until the Expiration Time:

     (i)     Each Shareholder agrees not to take any action that would make any representation or warranty of such
Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing, impeding, or, in any material respect, delaying,
interfering with or adversely affecting the performance by such Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

     (ii)     Each Shareholder hereby agrees to promptly notify Parent of the number of Shares, if any, acquired in
any Share Acquisition by such Shareholder after the execution hereof.

     (iii)     Each Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in any
announcement or disclosure required by applicable Law and any periodic report or proxy statement filed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement such Shareholder’s identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of such
Shareholder’s obligation under this Agreement.

Section 4.       Termination of Securities Purchase Agreement. Each Shareholder agrees that, effective as of the Effective

Surviving Corporation). From the date hereof through the date on which the Securities Purchase Agreement is terminated, without the
prior written consent of Parent, no Shareholder shall exercise any of its rights under Section 4.6 of the Securities Purchase Agreement.
In furtherance of the foregoing, effective as of the Effective Time, each Shareholder for itself and on behalf of its respective controlled
affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include other family members other than such Shareholder’s spouse and children
sharing the same household) and each of its and their respective successors and assigns hereby irrevocably, knowingly and voluntarily
releases, discharges and forever waives and relinquishes all claims, demands, liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs,
counterclaims, actions and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, which any such person has, may
have or might have or may assert now or in the future, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective successors
(including Parent), assigns, officers and directors, arising out of, based upon or resulting from the Securities Purchase Agreement,
whether known or unknown, and which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted or begun prior to the Effective Time. Each such
releasing party shall, and shall cause each of its controlled affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include other family
members other than such Shareholder’s spouse and children sharing the same household) to, refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim or demand or commencing, instituting or maintaining, or causing to be commenced, instituted or maintained any
legal or arbitral proceeding of any kind against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective successors (including
Parent), assigns, officers and directors based upon any matter released pursuant to this Section 4.

Section  5.       Intentionally Omitted.

Section  6.      Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of Parent and without further consideration, each
Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be necessary to consummate

  (a)       Representations and Warranties. Each WLR Party represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

     (i)     Power and Authority; Consents. Such WLR Party is duly organized and validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has all requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement. No filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is
necessary on the part of such WLR Party for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such WLR Party or the
consummation by such WLR Party of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (ii)     Due Authorization. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such WLR Party and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such WLR Party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such WLR Party.

     (iii)     Binding Agreement. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of such WLR Party, enforceable against such WLR Party in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies).

     (iv)     Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such WLR Party does not, and
the performance by such WLR Party of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by such WLR Party of the transactions

obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which such WLR Party is a party or by which such WLR Party or its
property or assets is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which such WLR Party or its property or assets is subject or any charter,

WLR Party contained herein.

  (b)       Support Covenants. From the date hereof until the Expiration Time:

     (i)     Each WLR Party agrees not to take any action that would make any representation or warranty of such

interfering with or adversely affecting the performance by such WLR Party of its obligations under this Agreement.

     (ii)     Each WLR Party hereby agrees to promptly notify Parent of the number of Shares, if any, acquired in
any Share Acquisition by such WLR Party after the execution hereof.

Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  (i)     Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed by any WLR Party in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that
Parent shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity.
Each WLR Party hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate
and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  (j)     No Waiver. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this
Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its
obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such
party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

  (k)     Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles.

to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action
or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 8(b).

Board of Directors
Sun Bancorp, Inc.
350 Fellowship Road, Suite 101
Mount Laurel, NJ 08054

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Sun Bancorp, Inc. (“Company”), OceanFirst Financial Corp. (“Parent”) and Mercury Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which
(i) Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, merge with and into Company with Company being
the surviving corporation, and (ii) immediately thereafter, Company will merge with and into Parent with Parent being the surviving
corporation (collectively, the “Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of
Company common stock, par value $5.00 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
(“Company Common Stock”), except for certain shares specified in the Agreement, shall be converted into the right to receive the
following, without interest: (a) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been
effectively made and not revoked (a “Cash Election”), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration (the “Cash
Consideration”); (b) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (“Parent Common Stock”) has been effectively made and not revoked (a “Stock Election”), a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (such number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the “Stock
Consideration”); and (c) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash Election or Stock Election
has been effectively made and not revoked, the right to receive such Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration as is determined
pursuant to the Agreement. The Agreement provides, generally, that shareholder elections may be adjusted as necessary such that the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Cash Consideration is equal to the quotient of (i) the Cash
Component divided by (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration. As defined more fully in the Agreement and subject to certain
adjustments as specified in the Agreement, the “Per Share Cash Consideration” shall be an amount equal to the sum, rounded to the
nearest one-tenth of a cent, of (A) $3.78, and (B) the product, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, of 0.7884 times the Parent
Share Closing Price, the “Exchange Ratio” shall be an amount equal to the quotient, rounded to the nearest one-ten thousandth, of (A)
the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by (B) the Parent Share Closing Price, and the “Cash Component” shall be an amount equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except for certain shares specified in the Agreement, and (B) $3.78. The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are
collectively referred to herein as the “Merger Consideration.” Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Agreement. The other terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement. You have
requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company
Common Stock.

Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (“Sandler O’Neill,” “we” or “our”), as part of its investment banking business, is regularly
engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate
transactions. In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed and considered, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement, dated
June 29, 2017; (ii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Company that we
deemed relevant; (iii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Parent and its banking
subsidiary that we deemed relevant; (iv) publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Company for the years
ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate for
the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of Company; (v) publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share
estimates for Parent for the years ending December 31, 2017, as presented on a core basis, and December 31, 2018, excluding certain
analyst estimates which incorporate a prospective reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, as well as an estimated internal
long-term earnings per share growth rate and estimated dividends per share for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior
management of Parent; (vi) the pro forma financial impact of the Merger on Parent based on certain assumptions relating to transaction
expenses, purchase accounting adjustments (including the estimated realization of Company’s existing deferred tax asset), cost savings
and a core deposit intangible asset, as provided by the senior management of Parent, as well as financial projections for Company for
the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as provided by the senior management of Parent and based upon
publicly available analyst earnings per share estimates for Company for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31,
2019 and an estimated long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter; (vii) the publicly reported historical price and
trading activity for Company and Parent common stock, including a comparison of certain stock market information for Company and
Parent common stock and certain stock indices as well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies, the
securities of which are publicly traded; (viii) a comparison of certain financial information for Company and Parent with similar banks
and thrifts for which information is publicly available; (ix) the financial terms of certain recent mergers and business combinations in
the bank and thrift industry (on a regional and national basis), to the extent publicly available; (x) the current market environment
generally and the banking environment in particular; and (xi) such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and
financial, economic and market criteria as we considered relevant. We also discussed with certain members of the senior management
of Company the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Company and held similar discussions with certain
members of the senior management of Parent regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Parent.

In performing our review, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that
was available to and reviewed by us from public sources, that was provided to us by Company or Parent, or their respective
representatives, or that was otherwise reviewed by us and we have assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering
this opinion without any independent verification or investigation. We have further relied on the assurances of the respective
managements of Company and Parent that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information
inaccurate or misleading. We have not been asked to and have not undertaken an independent verification of any of such information
and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We did not make an independent
evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
Company or Parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We
render no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets or the future performance of any loans of Company or Parent. We did
not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of Company or Parent, or the combined entity
after the Merger, and we have not reviewed any individual credit files relating to Company or Parent. We have assumed, with your
consent, that the respective allowances for loan losses for

both Company and Parent are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Company for
the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth
rate for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of Company. In addition, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available
consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Parent for the years ending December 31, 2017, as presented on a core basis, and
December 31, 2018, excluding certain analyst estimates which incorporate a prospective reduction to the federal corporate income tax
rate, as well as an estimated internal long-term earnings per share growth rate and estimated dividends per share for the years
thereafter, as provided by the senior management of Parent. Sandler O’Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain
assumptions relating to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments (including the estimated realization of Company’s
existing deferred tax asset), cost savings and a core deposit intangible asset, as provided by the senior management of Parent, as well as
financial projections for Company for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, as provided by the senior
management of Parent and based upon publicly available analyst earnings per share estimates for Company for the years ending
December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019 and an estimated long-term earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter.
With respect to the foregoing information, the respective managements of Company and Parent confirmed to us that such information
reflected (or, in the case of the publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates referred to above, were consistent
with) the best currently available projections, estimates and judgments of those respective senior managements of the future financial
performance of Company and Parent, respectively, and we assumed that such performance would be achieved. We express no opinion
as to such projections, estimates or judgments, or the assumptions on which they are based. We have also assumed that there has been
no material change in Company’s or Parent’s assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of
the most recent financial statements made available to us. We have assumed in all respects material to our analysis that Company and
Parent will remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to our analyses.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) each of the parties to the Agreement will comply in all
material respects with all material terms and conditions of the Agreement and all related agreements, that all of the representations and
warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to such agreements will
perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under such
agreements and that the conditions precedent in such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or
condition will be imposed that would have an effect on Company, Parent or the Merger or any related transaction that would be
material to our analysis, (iii) the Merger and any related transactions will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance
with all applicable laws and other requirements, (iv) the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. We express no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting or tax matters relating to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement.

Our analyses and opinion are necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect this opinion. We
have not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date
hereof. We express no opinion as to the trading values

of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock at any time or what the value of Parent Common Stock will be once it is
actually received by the holders of Company Common Stock.

We have acted as Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, which fee is
contingent upon consummation of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion, which opinion fee will be credited
in full towards the transaction fee which will become payable to us on the day of closing of the Merger. The Company has also agreed
to indemnify us against certain claims and liabilities arising out of our engagement and to reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with our engagement. Sandler O’Neill has not provided any other investment banking services to
Company during the two years preceding the date hereof. As we have previously advised you, in the two years preceding the date of
this opinion, we have provided certain investment banking services to, and received investment banking fees from, Parent. Most
recently, Sandler O’Neill acted as book-running manager in connection with Parent’s offer and sale of subordinated notes, which
transaction closed in September 2016. In addition, Sandler O’Neill acted as financial advisor to Parent in connection with Parent’s
acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc., which transaction closed in May 2016. In the ordinary course of our business as a broker-dealer, we
may purchase securities from and sell securities to Company, Parent and their respective affiliates. We may also actively trade the
equity and debt securities of Company and Parent or their respective affiliates for our own account and for the accounts of our
customers.

This letter is directed to the Board of Directors of Company in connection with its consideration of the Agreement and Merger
and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Company as to how any such shareholder should vote at any meeting
of shareholders called to consider and vote upon the Merger. Our opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock and does not address the underlying business decision of
Company to engage in the Merger, the form or structure of the Merger and/or other transactions contemplated in the Agreement, the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist for Company, or
the effect of any other transaction in which Company might engage. We also do not express any opinion as to the amount or nature of
the compensation to be received in or as a result of the Merger, and/or other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, if any, by any
Company or Parent officer, director or employee, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the amount of compensation to be
received by any other shareholder. This opinion has been approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee. This opinion shall
not be reproduced without Sandler O’Neill’s prior written consent; provided, however, Sandler O’Neill will provide its consent for the
opinion to be included in regulatory filings to be completed in connection with the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair to the
holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P.

Members of the Board:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to OceanFirst Financial Corp. (the “Company”) of the
Merger Consideration (as defined below) proposed to be paid by the Company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Agreement”) proposed to be entered into by and among the Company, Mercury Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (“Merger Sub”), and Sun Bancorp, Inc. (the “Target”). The Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Target, with the Target surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “First-Step Merger”)
and (ii) immediately thereafter, the merger of the Target with and into the Company, with the Company surviving (collectively with the
First-Step Merger, the “Transaction”). Upon the effective time of the First-Step Merger, each share of the common stock, par value
$5.00 per share, of the Target (“Target Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First-
Step Merger (other than certain shares of Target Common Stock held by the Company or Target) will be converted into the right to
receive, at the election of the shareholder thereof, either (a) cash (the “Cash Consideration”) in an amount equal to the sum of (i)
0.7884 multiplied by the volume-weighted average trading price of the Company common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Company
Common Stock”), on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five (5) full trading days ending on the last trading day preceding the
day on which the First-Step Merger occurs (the “Company Share Closing Price”) and (ii) $3.78 or (b) a number of validly-issued, fully-
paid and nonassesable shares of Company Common Stock equal to the amount of the Cash Consideration divided by the Company
Share Closing Price (such number of shares of Company Common Stock, the “Stock Consideration” and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”); provided that the maximum amount of cash that the Company will pay as the Merger
Consideration, other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Target Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First-Step Merger and (y) $3.78; and the maximum number
of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company will issue as Merger Consideration shall be equal to the number of shares of
Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First-Step Merger multiplied by 0.7884.

Piper Jaffray & Co., as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions. In arriving at our opinion, we have:
(i) reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft of the Agreement dated June 29, 2017; (ii) reviewed and analyzed certain
financial and other data with respect to the Company and the Target that was publicly available or made available to us by the
Company and by the Target; (iii) reviewed and analyzed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company and the Target
that was publicly available, as well as such information that was furnished to us by the Company and the Target, including forecasts of
the Company’s and Target’s expected operating results on a stand-alone basis; (iv) reviewed and analyzed materials detailing the
Transaction prepared by the Company, the Target and their respective affiliates and by their respective legal and accounting advisors,
including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and purchase accounting adjustments expected to
result from the Transaction (the “Synergies”); (v) conducted discussions with members of senior management and representatives of
the Company and the Target concerning the matters described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, as well as their respective
businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the Transaction and the Synergies; (vi) reviewed the

current and historical reported prices and trading activity of Company common stock and Target Common Stock and similar
information for certain other publicly traded companies deemed by us to be comparable to the Company and the Target; (vii) compared
the financial performance of the Company and the Target with that of certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(viii) performed certain financial analyses for the Company and the Target on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the
Transaction reflecting certain assumptions relating to the Synergies; (ix) analyzed the Merger Consideration relative to the Target’s
tangible book value, core deposits (deposits less all jumbo time deposits), last twelve months earnings, on a core basis, as of March 31,
2017, projected earnings for the full years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and projected earnings for the full year
ending December 31, 2018 assuming the cost savings to be achieved have been fully phased in as the Company projects;
(x) considered the current market environment generally and the depository banking environment in particular; and (xi) reviewed the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions in the depository banking industry that we
deemed relevant. In addition, we have conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other financial,
economic and market criteria as we have deemed necessary in arriving at our opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made available, to us or
discussed with or reviewed by us. We have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company and the Target that
the financial information provided has been prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with industry practice, and that they are not
aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to us incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of this opinion, we have assumed that with respect to financial forecasts, estimates and
other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) reviewed by us, that such information has been reasonably prepared based
on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and the Target as to
the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company and the Target, respectively, to which such financial
forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) relate and we have assumed that such results
would be achieved. We express no opinion as to any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information (including the
Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. We have further assumed that the Transaction will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. We express no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting and tax matters
relating to the Transaction and any other transactions contemplated in connection therewith and have relied, with your consent, on
advice of the outside legal counsel and the independent accountants to the Company, and on the assumptions of the management of the
Company and the Target, as to all accounting, legal, tax and financial reporting matters with respect to the Company, the Target and the
Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed that the executed Agreement will be in all material respects identical to the last draft
reviewed by us. We have relied upon and assumed, with your consent, without independent verification, that (i) the representations and
warranties of all parties to the Agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and
correct, (ii) each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
by such party, (iii) the Transaction will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement without amendments thereto and
(iv) all conditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without waiver by any party of any conditions or obligations
thereunder. Additionally, we have assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the Transaction will be
obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect the Company, the Target or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities (fixed, contingent,
derivative, off-balance sheet, or other) of the Company or the Target, and have not been furnished or provided with any such appraisals
or valuations, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Target under any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. Accordingly, we express no opinion regarding the liquidation value of the Company, the Target or any
other entity. We have assumed that there has been no material change in the respective assets, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of the Company or the Target since the date of the most recent financial data of the Company and of the Target
made available to us. We have also assumed that the Company and the Target would remain as a going concern for all periods relevant
to our analysis. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have not: (i) conducted a review of any individual credit files of
the Company or the Target, nor have we evaluated the adequacy of the loan or lease reserves of the Company or the Target,
(ii) conducted a review of any credit mark that may be taken in connection with the Transaction, nor have we evaluated the adequacy of
any contemplated credit mark to be so taken, or (iii) conducted a review of the collectability of any asset or the future performance of
any loan of the Company or the Target. We have assumed, with your consent, that the respective allowances for loan and lease losses
for the Company and the Target, and the credit mark are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the
Company. Accordingly, we express no opinion with respect to the foregoing. Again, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
we have undertaken no independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or
other contingent liabilities, to which the Company or the Target, or their respective affiliates, is a party or may be subject, and at the
direction of the Company and with your consent, our opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the
possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. We have also assumed that neither the Company nor
the Target is party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or
merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including the merger of the principal
banking subsidiaries of the Company and Target contemplated by the Agreement.

No company or transaction used in any analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to the Company, the Target or the Transaction.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not solely mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments about differences in the companies and transactions to which the Company, the Target and the Transaction were compared
and other factors that could affect the public trading value or transaction value of the companies.

This opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions and upon the information available to us and facts and
circumstances as they exist and are subject to evaluation on the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially
affect the assumptions used in preparing this opinion. We are not expressing any opinion herein as to the price at which shares of the
Company’s common stock may trade following announcement of the Transaction or at any future time. We have not undertaken to
reaffirm or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date hereof and do not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have been engaged by the Company to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction and we will receive a
transaction fee from the Company for providing our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of
the Transaction. We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the transaction
fee becoming payable to us upon closing of the Transaction. Our opinion fee is not contingent upon the consummation of the
Transaction or the conclusions reached in our opinion. The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities and
reimburse us for certain expenses in connection with our services. The Piper Jaffray investment banking team that advised the

Company in connection with the Transaction also advised the Company in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Ocean Shore
Holding Co., which acquisition closed in November of 2016 and in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Colonial American
Bank (while at a prior firm), which acquisition closed in July 2015. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we and our
affiliates may actively trade securities of the Company and the Target for our own account or the account of our customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. We may also, in the future, provide investment banking
and financial advisory services to the Company or entities that are affiliated with the Company, for which we would expect to receive
compensation.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Jaffray has adopted policies and procedures to establish and
maintain the independence of its Research Department and personnel. As a result, Piper Jaffray’s research analysts may hold opinions,
make statements or recommendations, and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and the Transaction and other
participants in the Transaction that differ from the views of Piper Jaffray’s investment banking personnel.

This opinion is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should act or
vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. Except with respect to the use of this opinion in connection with the proxy
statement relating to the Transaction in accordance with our engagement letter with the Company, this opinion shall not be disclosed,
referred to, published or otherwise used (in whole or in part), nor shall any public references to us be made, without our prior written
approval. This opinion has been approved for issuance by the Piper Jaffray Opinion Committee.

This opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Company of the proposed Merger Consideration to be
paid by the Company pursuant to the Agreement and does not address any other terms or agreement relating to the Transaction or any
other terms of the Agreement. We were not requested to opine as to, and this opinion does not address: (i) the basic business decision to
proceed with or effect the Transaction; (ii) the merits of the Transaction relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that
may be available to the Company; (iii) any other terms contemplated by the Agreement; or (iv) the fairness of the Transaction to any
creditor or other constituency of the Company. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of
compensation to be paid in the Transaction to any officer, director or employee of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such
persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to any other shareholder in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of
any such compensation, including whether such payments are reasonable in the context of the Transaction.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other factors as we consider relevant, it is our opinion that the Merger
Consideration to be paid by the Company pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company as of the
date hereof.

Sincerely,
