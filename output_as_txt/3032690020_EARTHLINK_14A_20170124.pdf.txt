MERGERS PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Windstream Holdings, Inc. (which we refer to as Windstream) and EarthLink Holdings Corp. (which we refer to as EarthLink) have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 5, 2016 (which, as it may be amended from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof, we refer to as the merger agreement). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger
agreement, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream (which we refer to as Merger Sub 1) will merge with and into EarthLink,
with EarthLink continuing as the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the merger) and, immediately following the merger, the
surviving corporation will merge with and into another indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream (which we refer to as Merger
Sub 2), with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving company (which we refer to as the subsequent merger and, together with the
merger, as the mergers).

Upon completion of the mergers, holders of outstanding shares of EarthLink common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger (other than Windstream, EarthLink, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries, whose shares will be automatically cancelled for no consideration) will receive for each share of EarthLink common stock
that they own 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock (which we refer to as the exchange ratio) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Windstream common stock to which they otherwise would be entitled after giving effect to the exchange ratio. The exchange ratio is
fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes with respect to Windstream’s or EarthLink’s stock prior to the closing of the
merger. Based on the closing price of Windstream common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (which we refer to as the
NASDAQ) on November 3, 2016, the last trading day before media reports of the possibility of a transaction were published, the merger
consideration represented approximately $5.55 in value for each share of EarthLink common stock. Based on the closing price of
Windstream common stock on January 23, 2017, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
the merger consideration represented approximately $6.76 in value for each share of EarthLink common stock. Windstream stockholders
will continue to own their existing Windstream shares. EarthLink common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol
“ELNK,” and Windstream common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “WIN.” Following the completion of the
mergers, shares of Windstream common stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol “WIN.” We urge you to obtain
current market quotations of EarthLink common stock and Windstream common stock before voting.

Based on the estimated number of shares of Windstream and EarthLink common stock that will be outstanding immediately prior to the
closing of the mergers, we estimate that, upon closing, existing Windstream stockholders will own approximately 51% of the outstanding
shares of Windstream and former EarthLink stockholders will own approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of Windstream.

Windstream and EarthLink will each hold special meetings of their respective stockholders in connection with the proposed mergers.

● At the special meeting of Windstream stockholders, Windstream stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on (1) the
proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Windstream common stock (which we refer to as the Windstream stock issuance) to
EarthLink stockholders pursuant to the merger (which we refer to as the Windstream stock issuance proposal), (2) the proposal to
approve an amendment to Windstream’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (which we refer to as the
Windstream charter amendment), increasing the number of authorized shares of Windstream common stock (which we refer to as
the Windstream charter amendment proposal) in order for Windstream to have sufficient authorized shares to complete the
Windstream stock issuance and for other general corporate purposes, including for purposes of future equity grants to Windstream
employees and issuances in connection with future strategic opportunities that may arise, and (3) the proposal to adjourn the
Windstream special meeting to solicit additional proxies if Windstream has not received proxies

representing a sufficient number of shares of Windstream common stock to approve the Windstream stock issuance proposal or the
Windstream charter amendment proposal (which we refer to as the Windstream adjournment proposal).
 

● At the special meeting of EarthLink stockholders, EarthLink stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on (1) the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement (which we refer to as the merger proposal), (2) the proposal to adjourn the EarthLink special meeting
to solicit additional proxies if EarthLink has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of EarthLink common
stock to approve the merger proposal (which we refer to as the EarthLink adjournment proposal) and (3) the proposal to approve,
on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to EarthLink’s named executive officers
in connection with the mergers, and the agreements and understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or
become payable (which we refer to as the compensation proposal).

We cannot complete the mergers unless the stockholders of Windstream approve the Windstream stock issuance proposal and the
Windstream charter amendment proposal, and the stockholders of EarthLink approve the merger proposal, each as described above. Your
vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of Windstream or EarthLink stock you own. Whether or not you expect
to attend either special meeting, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be
represented and voted at the Windstream or EarthLink special meeting, as applicable.

The Windstream board of directors (which we refer to as the Windstream Board) has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the adoption of the Windstream charter amendment and the
issuance of shares of Windstream common stock to EarthLink stockholders pursuant to the merger, and has determined and
declared that they are advisable and are in the best interests of Windstream and its stockholders. The Windstream Board
unanimously recommends that the Windstream stockholders vote “FOR” the Windstream stock issuance proposal, “FOR” the
Windstream charter amendment proposal and “FOR” the Windstream adjournment proposal.

The EarthLink board of directors (which we refer to as the EarthLink Board) has unanimously approved the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, and has determined and declared that they are advisable and
are in the best interests of EarthLink and its stockholders. The EarthLink Board unanimously recommends that EarthLink
stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the EarthLink adjournment proposal and “FOR” the compensation
proposal.

The obligations of Windstream and EarthLink to complete the mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions
described in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus. The accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus also contains
detailed information about EarthLink, Windstream, the special meetings, the merger agreement and the mergers. You should read this joint
proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety before voting, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 36.

We look forward to the successful completion of the mergers.

Sincerely,

Tony Thomas Joseph F. Eazor
President and Chief Executive Officer President and Chief Executive Officer

Windstream Holdings, Inc. EarthLink Holdings Corp.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Windstream or EarthLink, as applicable, may have regarding the mergers,
the merger proposal (as defined below), the compensation proposal (as defined below), the Windstream stock issuance (as defined below),
the Windstream charter amendment (as defined below) and the other matters being considered at the special meetings and answers to
those questions. Windstream and EarthLink urge you to carefully read the remainder of this joint proxy statement/prospectus because the
information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the mergers, the merger
proposal, the compensation proposal, the Windstream stock issuance, the Windstream charter amendment and the other matters being
considered at the special meetings. Additional important information is also contained in the Annexes to, and the documents incorporated
by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:       Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?
 

A: You are receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus because you were a stockholder of record of EarthLink or Windstream on
January 23, 2017, the record date for the EarthLink special meeting and the Windstream special meeting, respectively. EarthLink
and Windstream have agreed to the mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

In order to complete the mergers, among other things:

■ Windstream stockholders must vote to approve (i) the issuance of shares of Windstream common stock (which we refer to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream stock issuance) to EarthLink stockholders pursuant to the merger
(which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream stock issuance proposal) and (ii) the
amendment (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream charter amendment) of
Windstream’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Windstream charter) increasing the number of authorized shares of Windstream common stock
(which we refer to as the Windstream charter amendment proposal); and
 

■ EarthLink stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the mergers (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the merger proposal).

 
EarthLink and Windstream will hold separate special meetings of their respective stockholders to obtain these approvals (each of
which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the EarthLink special meeting and the Windstream special meeting,
respectively). In addition, EarthLink will solicit stockholder approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation that
may become payable to EarthLink’s named executive officers in connection with the mergers (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the compensation proposal). The separate vote, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation
proposal, is not a condition to the completion of the mergers. This joint proxy statement/prospectus, including its Annexes, contains
and incorporates by reference important information about Windstream and EarthLink, the mergers, the merger proposal, the
compensation proposal, the Windstream

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 14/364

stock issuance, the Windstream charter amendment and the Windstream and EarthLink special meetings, respectively. You should
read all of the available information carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed proxy card and instructions allow you to vote your
shares without attending the special meeting.

 
Your vote is important. Please vote as soon as possible.

 
Q:       What will I receive in the mergers?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: If the mergers are completed, holders of shares of EarthLink common stock (other than Windstream,

EarthLink, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, whose shares will be
automatically cancelled for no consideration, which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as cancelled shares) will be
entitled to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock for each share of EarthLink common stock held as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the exchange ratio or the
merger consideration). EarthLink stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Windstream common stock in the mergers.
Instead, Windstream will pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Windstream common stock that an EarthLink stockholder
would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the merger after giving effect to the exchange ratio.

 
Windstream Stockholders: Windstream stockholders will not receive any merger consideration and will continue to hold their
shares of Windstream common stock.

 
Q: What is the value of the merger consideration?
 
A: Because Windstream will issue 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock in exchange for each share of EarthLink common stock

held as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than the cancelled shares), the value of the merger
consideration that holders of shares of EarthLink common stock receive will depend on the price per share of Windstream common
stock at the effective time of the merger. That price will not be known at the time of the Windstream and EarthLink special
meetings and may be more or less than the current price or the price at the time of such special meetings. The exchange ratio will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Windstream common stock or EarthLink common stock between the date
of signing the merger agreement and completion of the mergers. Based on the closing price of Windstream common stock on the
NASDAQ on November 3, 2016, the last trading day before media reports of the possibility of a transaction were published, the
merger consideration represented approximately $5.55 in value for each share of EarthLink common stock. Based on the closing
price of Windstream common stock on January 23, 2017, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the merger consideration represented approximately $6.76 in value for each share of EarthLink common
stock.

 
Windstream stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of Windstream common stock. Windstream common stock is
currently traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “WIN,” and EarthLink common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ
under the symbol “ELNK.” We urge you to obtain current market quotations of Windstream common stock and EarthLink common
stock.

Q: If I am an EarthLink stockholder, can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares?
 
A:        Yes. If you are an EarthLink stockholder of record, you may vote your shares in person at the EarthLink special meeting by

completing a ballot at the meeting. Even if you currently plan to attend the EarthLink special meeting, it is recommended that you
also submit your proxy as described below, so your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting. If you submit
your vote by proxy and later decide to vote in person at the meeting, the vote you submit at the meeting will override your proxy
vote. If you are a “street name” holder (i.e., you hold the shares in the name of your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee),
you may vote your shares in person at the meeting only if you obtain and bring to the meeting a signed letter or other form of legal
proxy from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.

 
Q: If I am a Windstream stockholder, can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares?
 
A: Yes. If you are a Windstream stockholder of record, you may vote your shares via the Internet at the Windstream special meeting

by following the instructions for joining and voting at the special meeting posted at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WIN17SM. However, there will be very limited time to vote at the special meeting, and thus,
you are encouraged to vote in advance or immediately at the start of the meeting. To vote during the meeting, you will need the 16-
digit control number provided on your proxy card or voting instruction form. Broadridge Financial Solutions is hosting our virtual
special meeting and, on the date of the special meeting, will be available via telephone at 1-855-449-0991 to answer your questions
regarding how to attend and participate in the special meeting via the Internet. Even if you currently plan to attend the Windstream
special meeting, it is recommended that you also submit your proxy as described below, so your vote will be counted if you later
decide not to attend the meeting. If you submit your vote by proxy and later decide to vote at the meeting, the vote you submit at
the meeting will override your proxy vote. If you are a “street name” holder (i.e., you hold the shares in the name of your broker,
bank, trust company or other nominee), and you wish to vote your shares at the meeting, you must follow the instructions provided
at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WIN17SM.

 
Q: How can I attend the meeting?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: All of EarthLink’s stockholders as of the record date (and their duly authorized proxyholders) are invited

to attend the EarthLink special meeting. Proof of stock ownership as of this date and some form of government issued photo
identification (such as a valid driver’s license or passport) will be required for admission to the special meeting. If you hold your
shares in “street name,” you will need to obtain a “legal proxy” from the record holder to attend the EarthLink special meeting.
EarthLink reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership (or proxy authority) and
without proper photo identification.

 
To help EarthLink plan for the meeting, please indicate whether you expect to attend by responding affirmatively when prompted
during Internet or telephone voting or by marking the attendance box on the proxy card.

Q: When and where will the special stockholders meetings be held?

special meeting in person.

 
Q:       Who is entitled to vote at the special stockholders meetings?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: The board of directors of EarthLink (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the

EarthLink Board) has set January 23, 2017 as the record date for the EarthLink special meeting. If you were a stockholder of record
of issued and outstanding shares of EarthLink common stock at the close of business on January 23, 2017, you are entitled to vote
at the EarthLink special meeting. As of the record date, 105,594,768 shares of EarthLink’s common stock, representing all of
EarthLink’s voting stock, were issued and outstanding and, therefore, eligible to vote at the EarthLink special meeting.

 
Windstream Stockholders: The board of directors of Windstream (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Windstream Board) has set January 23, 2017 as the record date for the Windstream special meeting. If you were a stockholder of
record of outstanding shares of Windstream common stock at the close of business on January 23, 2017, you are entitled to vote at
the Windstream special meeting. As of the record date, 96,234,324 shares of Windstream’s common stock, representing all of
Windstream’s voting stock, were issued and outstanding and, therefore, eligible to vote at the meeting.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum at the special stockholders meetings?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: In accordance with EarthLink’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (which we refer to in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus as the EarthLink bylaws), stockholders who hold shares representing a majority of the number of shares of
EarthLink stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the EarthLink special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy
to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the EarthLink special meeting. Abstentions and shares of record held by a
broker, bank, trust company or other nominee that are voted on any matter are included in determining whether a quorum is
present. Shares of record held by a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee that are not instructed how to vote on any matter
will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present.

Windstream Stockholders: In accordance with Windstream’s Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (which we refer to in the joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream bylaws), stockholders who hold shares representing a majority of the outstanding
shares of Windstream common stock entitled to vote must be present or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at the Windstream special meeting. Abstentions and shares of record held by a broker, bank, trust company
or other nominee, whether or not voted on any matter, will be included in determining whether a quorum is present.
 

Q:       What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
 

A: If you receive more than one set of proxy materials or multiple control numbers for use in submitting your proxy, it means that you
hold shares registered in more than one account or hold shares of both Windstream and EarthLink. To ensure that all of your shares
are voted, sign and return each proxy card or voting instruction card you receive or, if you submit your proxy by Internet or
telephone, vote once for each card or control number you receive.
 

Q: How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?
 

A: EarthLink Stockholders: If you are a stockholder of record of EarthLink as of the close of business on the record date for the
EarthLink special meeting, you may vote in person by attending the EarthLink special meeting or, to ensure your shares are
represented at the EarthLink special meeting, you may authorize a proxy to vote by:

■ accessing the Internet site listed on the proxy card;
 

■ calling the toll-free number listed on the proxy card; or
 

■ signing the enclosed proxy card and returning it by mail.

company or other nominee. Your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee has enclosed or otherwise provided a voting
instruction card for you to use in directing such broker, bank, trust company or other nominee how to vote your shares. Without
instructions from you, your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee cannot vote your shares, which will have the effect
described below.

to vote in advance or immediately at the start of the meeting. If you are a stockholder of record of Windstream as of the close of
business on the record date for the Windstream special meeting, you may vote via live webcast by attending the Windstream special
meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WIN17SM or, to ensure your shares are represented at the Windstream special

Q:      What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a “street name” holder?
 
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If your

shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, broker, trust company or other nominee, then the broker, bank, trust
company or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, while you are considered the
beneficial owner of those shares. In the latter case, your shares are said to be held in “street name.”

 
Q: My shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank, trust company or other nominee. Will my broker, bank, trust

company or other nominee automatically vote my shares for me?
 
A: No. Your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee cannot vote your shares on “non-routine” matters, as described below in the

section titled “What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote,” without instructions from you. This is
often called a “broker non-vote.” You should instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee as to how to vote your
shares, following the directions it provides to you. Please check the voting form used by your broker, bank, trust company or other
nominee. If you do not provide your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee with instructions on any matter, your shares will
not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum at the EarthLink special meeting if you are an EarthLink stockholder; your
shares will, however, be counted for purposes of determining a quorum at the Windstream special meeting if you are a Windstream
stockholder. If you provide your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee with instructions on any matter, your shares will be
counted for purposes of determining a quorum at the EarthLink special meeting and will be voted on each proposal on which you
have provided instructions according to your instructions at each special meeting. Please note that you may not vote shares held in
“street name” by returning a proxy card directly to EarthLink or Windstream or by voting at your special meeting unless, in the case
of EarthLink, you first obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee.

 
Q: What will happen if I fail to vote?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for EarthLink to obtain the necessary quorum to approve the

merger proposal and the compensation proposal, and obtain the necessary vote to approve the EarthLink adjournment proposal.
 

If you are a stockholder of record and you fail to vote by proxy or by ballot at the special meeting, or if you hold your shares in
“street name” and fail to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee how to vote on any matter, your shares will not
be in attendance at the EarthLink special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. However, if you
hold your shares in “street name” and fail to instruct your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee how to vote on some but
not all matters brought before the meeting, your shares will be in attendance at the EarthLink special meeting and counted for
purposes of determining a quorum, but will be treated as a broker non-vote as to each uninstructed matter. Shares not in attendance
at the EarthLink special meeting (whether due to a stockholder of record’s failure to submit a proxy or vote at the meeting or a
“street name” holder’s failure to

instruct its broker, bank, trust company or other nominee how to vote on any matter) and broker non-votes will be treated in the following
manner with respect to determining the votes received for each of the proposals:

■ with respect to stockholders of record, a failure to submit a proxy card or vote in person, by telephone, or through the Internet will
have no effect on the EarthLink adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal, but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the
merger proposal; and
 

■ with respect to “street name” holders,

■ a share not in attendance at the EarthLink special meeting because the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee has
received no instructions regarding how to vote on any matter will have no effect on the EarthLink adjournment proposal or the
compensation proposal, but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal; and
 

■ a broker non-vote will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, the EarthLink adjournment proposal (whether or
not a quorum is present) and the compensation proposal.

Windstream Stockholders: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for Windstream to obtain the necessary quorum to approve the
Windstream stock issuance proposal and the Windstream charter amendment proposal, and obtain the necessary vote to approve the
Windstream adjournment proposal.

All shares held on behalf of a “street name” holder of Windstream common stock by a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee will
be counted for purposes of determining a quorum regardless of whether the “street name” holder instructs the broker, bank, trust company
or other nominee how to vote on all, some or none of the matters brought before the Windstream special meeting, but will be treated as a
broker non-vote as to each uninstructed matter. However, if you are the stockholder of record and you fail to vote by proxy or at the
Windstream special meeting, your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. Failures to submit a proxy card or
vote at the Windstream special meeting and broker non-votes will be treated in the following manner with respect to determining the votes
received for each of the proposals:

■ with respect to stockholders of record, a failure to submit a proxy card or vote at the special meeting, by telephone or through the
Internet will have no effect on the Windstream stock issuance proposal or the Windstream adjournment proposal (whether or not a
quorum is present), but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream charter amendment proposal; and
 

■ with respect to “street name” holders, a broker non-vote will be treated

■ as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream charter amendment proposal;
 

■ if a quorum is not present and such share was instructed how to vote as to any other matter, as a vote “AGAINST” the
Windstream adjournment proposal;
 

■ as having no effect on the Windstream stock issuance proposal or, if a quorum is present, the Windstream adjournment
proposal; and
 

■ if a quorum is not present and such share was not instructed how to vote as to any matter, as having no effect on the
Windstream adjournment proposal.

Q:      What will happen if I abstain from voting?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: You may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on each of the proposals. An abstention will be

counted for purposes of determining a quorum. However, an abstention will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal,
the EarthLink adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present) and the compensation proposal.

 
Windstream Stockholders: You may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on each of the proposals. An abstention will be
counted for purposes of determining a quorum. However, an abstention will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream
charter amendment proposal and, if a quorum is not present, the Windstream adjournment proposal, but will have no effect on the
Windstream stock issuance proposal or, if a quorum is present, the Windstream adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: If you are a stockholder of record and you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail but do not

specify how you want to vote your shares on a particular proposal, EarthLink will vote your shares:

■ “FOR” the merger proposal;
 

■ “FOR” EarthLink adjournment proposal; and
 

■ “FOR” the compensation proposal.

If you are a “street name” holder and fail to instruct the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee that is the stockholder of
record how you want to vote your shares on a particular proposal, those shares are considered to be “uninstructed” with respect to
such proposal. Stockholders of record of shares held in “street name” have the discretion to vote uninstructed shares on specified
routine matters, but do not have the authority to vote uninstructed shares on non-routine matters, such as the merger proposal, the
EarthLink adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal. If you fail to give any instructions and, as a result, your shares are
uninstructed on all proposals brought before the EarthLink special meeting, your shares will not be in attendance at the meeting and
will have no effect on the EarthLink adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal, but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST”
the merger proposal. If you fail to give instructions on some but not all of the proposals brought before the EarthLink special
meeting, your shares will be treated as a broker non-vote with respect to each uninstructed proposal. A broker non-vote will be
treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, the EarthLink adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present) and
the compensation proposal.

Windstream Stockholders: If you are a stockholder of record and you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail but do not
specify how you want to vote your shares on a particular proposal, Windstream will vote your shares:

■ “FOR” the Windstream stock issuance proposal;
 

■ “FOR” the Windstream charter amendment proposal; and
 

■ “FOR” the Windstream adjournment proposal.

If you are a “street name” holder and fail to instruct the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee that is the stockholder of
record how you want to vote your shares on a particular proposal, those shares are considered to be “uninstructed” with respect to
such proposal. Stockholders of record of shares held in “street name” have the discretion to vote uninstructed shares on specified
routine matters, but do not have the authority to vote uninstructed shares on non-routine matters, such as the Windstream stock
issuance proposal, the Windstream charter amendment proposal and the Windstream adjournment proposal. A broker non-vote will
be treated (i) as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream charter amendment proposal, (ii) if a quorum is not present and such share was
instructed how to vote as to any other matter, as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream adjournment proposal, (iii) as having no effect
on the Windstream stock issuance proposal or, if a quorum is present, the Windstream adjournment proposal and (iv) if a quorum is
not present and such share was not instructed how to vote as to any matter, as having no effect on the Windstream adjournment
proposal.

 
Q: Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?
 
A: Yes. If you are the holder of record of either EarthLink common stock or Windstream common stock, you can change your vote or

revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at your special meeting. You can do this in one of four ways:

■ by submitting a later-dated proxy by Internet or telephone before the deadline stated on the enclosed proxy card;
 

■ by submitting a later-dated proxy card;
 

■ by sending a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of EarthLink or Windstream, as applicable, which must
be received before the time of such special meeting; or
 

■ by voting in person by ballot or via live webcast at the EarthLink or Windstream special meeting, as applicable.

If you are a “street name” holder, please refer to the voting instructions provided to you by your broker, bank, trust company or
other nominee.

 
Any holder of EarthLink common stock or Windstream common stock entitled to vote at the EarthLink or Windstream special
meeting, respectively, may vote at the meeting regardless of whether a proxy has been previously given. A Windstream or
EarthLink stockholder simply attending the Windstream or EarthLink special meeting, respectively, will not constitute revocation of
a previously given proxy.

 
Q: Will EarthLink be required to submit the merger proposal to its stockholders even if the EarthLink Board has withdrawn

(or amended or modified in a manner adverse to Windstream) its recommendation?
 
A:       Yes, unless the merger agreement has been terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. For more

information regarding the ability of EarthLink or Windstream to terminate the merger agreement, see the sections entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Termination” beginning on page 151 and “The Merger Agreement—Payments,” beginning on page 152.

Q:      Will Windstream be required to submit the Windstream stock issuance proposal and the Windstream charter amendment
proposal to its stockholders even if the Windstream Board has withdrawn (or amended or modified in a manner adverse to
EarthLink) its recommendation?

 
A: Yes, unless the merger agreement has been terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. For more

information regarding the ability of Windstream or EarthLink to terminate the merger agreement, see the sections entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Termination” beginning on page 151 and “The Merger Agreement—Payments,” beginning on page 152.

 
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of shares of EarthLink common

stock?
 
A: Windstream and EarthLink intend for the mergers to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Code)
such that U.S. holders (as defined under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) will not recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of EarthLink common stock for shares of Windstream common stock in
the mergers, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares. It is a condition to Windstream’s obligation to
complete the mergers that Windstream receive an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP to the effect that the
mergers will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition of EarthLink’s
obligation to complete the mergers that EarthLink receive an opinion from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to the
effect that the mergers will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 
You should read the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 154 for a more complete
discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. Tax consequences of the mergers to you will
depend on your particular facts and circumstances. Please consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the
mergers to you.

 
Q: When do you expect the mergers to be completed?
 
A: EarthLink and Windstream hope to complete the mergers as soon as reasonably practicable and currently expect the closing of the

mergers to occur in the first half of 2017. However, the mergers are subject to various regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or
waiver of other conditions described in the merger agreement, and it is possible that factors outside the control of EarthLink and
Windstream could result in the mergers being completed at a later time or not at all. There can be no assurances as to when or if the
mergers will close.

 
Q: Do I need to do anything with my shares of common stock other than voting for the proposals at the special meeting?
 
A: EarthLink Stockholders: If you are an EarthLink stockholder, after the mergers are completed, each share of EarthLink common

stock you hold as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than the cancelled shares) will be converted into
the right to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Windstream common
stock to which you otherwise are entitled after giving effect to the

exchange ratio. You will receive instructions at that time regarding exchanging your shares for the merger consideration. You do not
need to take any action at this time. Please do not send your EarthLink share certificates, if any, with your proxy card.

 
Windstream Stockholders: If you are a Windstream stockholder, after the mergers are completed, you are not required to take any
action with respect to your shares of Windstream common stock.

 
Q:      Are stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?
 
A: Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the

DGCL), neither Windstream stockholders nor EarthLink stockholders are entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in connection with
the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Windstream common stock or EarthLink common stock before the special meeting?
 
A: The record dates for the Windstream and EarthLink special meetings are earlier than the date of the special meetings and the date

that the mergers are expected to be completed. If you transfer your shares of Windstream or EarthLink common stock after the
applicable record date but before the applicable special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the applicable special meeting.
However, if you are an EarthLink stockholder, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the
merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, holders of EarthLink common stock must hold their shares through the
completion of the merger.

 
Q: What if I hold shares in both EarthLink and Windstream?
 
A: If you are a stockholder of both EarthLink and Windstream, you will receive two separate packages of proxy materials. A vote cast

as a Windstream stockholder will not count as a vote cast as an EarthLink stockholder, and a vote cast as an EarthLink stockholder
will not count as a vote cast as a Windstream stockholder. Therefore, please separately submit a proxy for each of your EarthLink
and Windstream shares.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation proposal?
 
A: The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Exchange Act)

and applicable SEC rules thereunder require EarthLink to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that
could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

 
Q: What will happen if the stockholders of EarthLink do not approve the compensation proposal at the EarthLink special

meeting?
 
A: Approval of the compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the mergers. The vote with respect to the

compensation proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on either EarthLink or Windstream. However, the companies will
take under advisement the voting results on the compensation proposal. If the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and
the mergers are completed, the amounts payable under the compensation proposal may still be paid to EarthLink’s named executive
officers in accordance with applicable agreements and understandings.

Q: Who pays for the cost of proxy preparation and solicitation?
 
A:       Subject to the parties’ respective rights to be reimbursed for their incurred expenses if the merger agreement is terminated in certain

circumstances (as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus), EarthLink will bear the entire cost of proxy
solicitation for the EarthLink special meeting, Windstream will bear the entire cost of proxy solicitation for the Windstream special
meeting, and EarthLink and Windstream will bear all expenses incurred by such party in connection with the filing of the
registration statement of which this document forms a part with the SEC and the printing and mailing of this document.

 
Q: Who can answer my questions?
 
A: Windstream stockholders or EarthLink stockholders who have questions about the mergers, the other matters to be voted on at the

special meetings, or how to submit a proxy or who desire additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or additional
proxy cards should contact:

Risk Factors

In addition to other information included in and incorporated by reference into this document, including the matters addressed in the
section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully read and consider the risks
related to the mergers, including the parties’ ability to complete the mergers, the risks related to Windstream following the mergers and
the risks associated with each of the businesses of EarthLink and Windstream, beginning on page 34, before deciding whether to vote
for the proposals presented in this document.

The Mergers

A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The rights and obligations of
Windstream and EarthLink are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any
other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Windstream and EarthLink stockholders are urged to read the
merger agreement carefully and in its entirety as well as this joint proxy statement/prospectus before making any decisions regarding
the mergers, including the approval of the merger proposal or the approval of the Windstream stock issuance proposal and the
Windstream charter amendment proposal, as applicable. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement.
For more information on the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 124.

The Mergers (see page 124)

The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Merger Sub 1 will
merge with and into EarthLink, with EarthLink continuing as the surviving corporation, and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Windstream. Immediately after the effective time of the merger, EarthLink will merge with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2
continuing as the surviving company, and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates (see page 124)

At the effective time of the merger, each share of EarthLink common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger (other than the cancelled shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common
stock.

Windstream will not issue fractional shares of Windstream common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, each EarthLink
stockholder who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Windstream common stock will receive, in lieu
of such fractional share, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price for a share of Windstream common stock on the NASDAQ on the business
day immediately preceding the closing of the merger.

The exchange ratio will be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution or other change with
respect to the shares of Windstream common stock or shares of EarthLink common stock prior to the effective time of the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 154)

Windstream and EarthLink intend for the mergers to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
such that U.S. holders (as defined under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) will not recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes upon the exchange

of shares of EarthLink Common Stock for shares of Windstream Common Stock in the mergers, except with respect to cash received in
lieu of fractional shares. It is a condition to Windstream’s obligation to complete the mergers that Windstream receive an opinion from
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP to the effect that the mergers will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition of EarthLink’s obligation to complete the mergers that EarthLink receive an opinion from
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to the effect that the mergers will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

You should read the section titled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 154 for a more complete
discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. Tax consequences of the mergers to you will depend
on your particular facts and circumstances. Please consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the mergers
to you.

Recommendation of EarthLink’s Board of Directors (see page 66)

After careful consideration, the EarthLink Board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the mergers, and has determined and declared that they are advisable and are in the best interests of EarthLink and
its stockholders. For more information regarding the factors considered by the EarthLink Board in reaching its decision to approve the
merger agreement and the mergers, see the section entitled “EarthLink’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of EarthLink’s
Board of Directors.”

In considering the recommendation of the EarthLink Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
mergers, you should be aware that the EarthLink directors and executive officers have interests in the mergers that may be different
from, or in addition to, yours. See the section entitled “The Mergers—Interests of EarthLink Directors and Executive Officers in the
Mergers” beginning on page 110.

The EarthLink Board unanimously recommends that the EarthLink stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR”
the EarthLink adjournment proposal and “FOR” the compensation proposal.

Recommendation of Windstream’s Board of Directors (see page 93)

After careful consideration, the Windstream Board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Windstream stock issuance and the adoption of the Windstream charter amendment, and has determined and
declared that they are advisable and are in the best interests of Windstream and its stockholders. For more information regarding the

Foros Securities LLC

Foros Securities LLC (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Foros) delivered to the EarthLink Board an
opinion, dated November 5, 2016, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and other matters set forth therein, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of EarthLink
common stock.

Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the mergers. Foros’s opinion does not
address any other aspect of the mergers and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act
in connection with the mergers or any other matter.

Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Goldman Sachs) delivered its opinion to the
EarthLink Board that, as of November 5, 2016 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Windstream and its

incorporated herein by reference. Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are
encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety.

Interests of Windstream Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (see page 110)

The mergers do not constitute a “change in control” under Windstream’s employment or change in control agreements entered into
with its executive officers and therefore the merger will not trigger any benefits under such agreements. Likewise, the mergers do not
constitute a “change in control” under the equity compensation plans of Windstream and therefore will not cause any acceleration of
outstanding Windstream equity awards.

Interests of EarthLink Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (see page 110)

Certain members of the board of directors and executive officers of EarthLink may be deemed to have interests in the mergers that are
in addition to, or different from, the interests of other EarthLink stockholders generally. The EarthLink Board was aware of and
considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
merger agreement and the merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the EarthLink stockholders. These
interests include:

● Outstanding EarthLink stock options held by the members of the EarthLink Board and EarthLink’s executive officers will
vest pursuant to their terms upon consummation of the merger and be settled for shares of Windstream common stock;
 

● The employment agreement with Mr. Eazor and the Change-in-Control Accelerated Vesting and Severance Plan for executive
officers provide for severance benefits upon certain qualifying terminations of employment following the consummation of the
mergers;
 

● Members of the EarthLink Board and EarthLink’s executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance
coverage under the merger agreement; and
 

● Certain executive officers and key employees of EarthLink and certain members of the EarthLink Board may be offered post-
closing offer letters or arrangements. Among such agreements, Windstream has entered into an offer letter in connection with the
mergers with Mr. John Dobbins, EarthLink's Executive Vice President of Network Operations. The new offer letter is generally
consistent with the terms of other compensation arrangements with Windstream executives. Further details of Mr. Dobbins' offer
letter can be found in the “Interests of EarthLink Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” section beginning on page 110.

Windstream Board; Governance Matters (see page 146)

Prior to the closing of the mergers, Windstream will increase the size of the Windstream Board to twelve members and, effective as of
the effective time of the merger, will appoint three members of the EarthLink Board (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the EarthLink designees) selected by EarthLink to the Windstream Board. The EarthLink designees must be
reasonably acceptable to Windstream, taking into account Windstream’s normal corporate governance process for selection of directors
to the Windstream Board.

18



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 31/364

The EarthLink designees will serve until Windstream’s next annual meeting of stockholders, and must be nominated for election to the
Windstream Board at the first annual meeting immediately following the closing of the mergers and Windstream must solicit proxies in
favor of their election using efforts no less than the efforts used to solicit proxies in favor of the election of the other individuals
nominated to the Windstream Board.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, EarthLink has not determined the identities of the EarthLink designees.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers (see page 119)

EarthLink and Windstream have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval from or notices to the Department of Justice
(which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the DOJ), the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the FTC), the Federal Communications Commission (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the FCC), certain state public service or state public utility commissions (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as PSCs), and possibly various other federal, state and local regulatory authorities.

EarthLink and Windstream have filed numerous applications and notifications to obtain the required regulatory approvals. Although
EarthLink and Windstream believe that all required regulatory approvals can be obtained, EarthLink and Windstream cannot be certain
when or if these approvals will be obtained.

Treatment of Options to Purchase EarthLink Shares and EarthLink RSUs (see page 121)

Options

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase EarthLink common stock will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive a number of shares of Windstream common stock equal to (i) the product of the number of shares of EarthLink
common stock underlying such option and the exchange ratio, less (ii) that number of shares of Windstream common stock, if any,
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such option with a fair market value
(determined based on the closing price of EarthLink common stock on the business day immediately prior to the closing of the merger)
equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate exercise price of such EarthLink option plus (y) any required federal, state, local or foreign tax
withholding on such option and (B) the exchange ratio, provided that any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will
be treated in the same manner as any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration.

Restricted Stock Units

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding EarthLink restricted stock unit will be assumed by Windstream and converted into
a Windstream restricted stock unit with respect to that number of shares of Windstream common stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such EarthLink restricted stock unit by the exchange ratio, provided that any
resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same manner as any resulting fractional shares of
Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration. The other pre-existing terms of the EarthLink restricted stock unit,
including vesting, shall continue to apply to the Windstream restricted stock unit.

Financing Efforts and Related Cooperation (see page 146)

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has acknowledged and agreed that the obtaining of any financing is not a condition to the closing
of the mergers.

Prior to the effective time of the mergers, EarthLink will provide (and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees, consultants, advisors, counsel, accountants, auditors and other representatives to provide) such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Windstream with respect to any financing of the mergers, subject to certain limitations, including, among other things,
that EarthLink, its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, advisors, accountants, consultants,
auditors, agents and other representatives will not be required to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the business of
EarthLink and its subsidiaries or that would violate any material agreement of EarthLink or any of its subsidiaries.

Windstream will promptly reimburse EarthLink and its subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by it and its subsidiaries in complying with the financing cooperation provisions of the merger agreement.
Windstream will indemnify EarthLink and its subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
representatives, from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, interest, costs, expenses, awards, judgments, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement, suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with any financing, other than any claims arising
(i) from fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or gross negligence of EarthLink, its subsidiaries or their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives or (ii) as a result of information provided by EarthLink, its subsidiaries
or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives to Windstream specifically to be used in connection
with the financing being materially misleading or materially incorrect.

Subject to certain limited exceptions, EarthLink and its subsidiaries have agreed to consent to the use of their logos in connection with
any financing.

Prior to or at closing of the mergers, EarthLink must deliver an executed payoff letter in customary form for its Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2016.

EarthLink has agreed that Windstream and its affiliates may share any information with respect to EarthLink and its subsidiaries with
financing sources in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with any financing. However, the recipients of such
information must agree to customary confidentiality arrangements, including “click through” confidentiality agreements and
confidentiality provisions contained in customary bank books and offering memoranda.

Completion of the Mergers (see page 126)

Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the mergers will take place on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable law) of the conditions to the closing of the mergers (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied
until the closing of the mergers, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the closing of the
mergers). The mergers will be effective on the date shown on the certificates of merger filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in accordance with the laws of Delaware.

No Solicitation of Alternative Transaction Proposals (see page 139)

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed that, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the closing of the merger
and the termination of the merger agreement (which we refer to as the no shop period), each of the parties and its respective
subsidiaries will not and will instruct its affiliates and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
facilitate or encourage

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 33/364

any alternative transaction proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative transaction
proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any persons regarding, or furnish to any person non-public
information with respect to, or knowingly cooperate in any way with any person in connection with soliciting, initiating, facilitating or
encouraging, any alternative transaction proposal or the submission or making of an inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an alternative transaction proposal.

Prior to the necessary stockholder approval, each party’s board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change and, in the
case of an alternative transaction proposal, terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a an
alternative transaction proposal (i) if the party’s board of directors determines that an alternative transaction proposal constitutes a
superior proposal or (ii) in response to any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to the party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, such party’s board of directors, that becomes
known to such party’s board of directors prior to such party’s stockholder approvals required under the merger agreement and does not
involve or relate to an alternative transaction proposal if, in either case, the party’s board determines in good faith that the failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. Neither party will be entitled to exercise its right to make an
adverse recommendation change or, in the case of an alternative transaction proposal which constitutes a superior proposal, terminate
the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the superior proposal, unless (i) the party has given the other
party at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice that the party’s board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons,
including, in the case of a superior proposal, the material terms of any superior proposal, (ii) during such period, the party has
negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, with the other party in good faith, to the extent the other party desires to
negotiate, to enable the other party to propose in writing a binding offer to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement so that, if applicable, the alternative transaction proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal or, in connection
with a change in recommendation not involving or relating to an alternative transaction proposal, would cause the party’s board no
longer to believe that the failure to make a recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties, and (iii) at the end of such period, the party’s board must have considered in good faith such binding offer and determined that
the superior proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal or, other than in the case of an alternative transaction proposal, that it
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the party’s board’s fiduciary duties.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 37/364

Windstream will be required to pay a termination fee of $35,000,000 in the event that (A) EarthLink terminates the merger agreement
due to an adverse recommendation change by the Windstream Board, (B) Windstream terminates the merger agreement in order to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal or (C) following announcement of an alternative transaction
proposal, (i) the Windstream stockholder approval is not obtained, the merger agreement is terminated following the termination date
or the merger agreement is terminated due to a breach of the merger agreement by Windstream, and (ii) an alternative transaction
proposal is consummated, or a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative transaction proposal is executed, in each case within

agreement or breaches its covenant to keep sufficient funds available to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, Windstream will be required to pay a termination fee of $70,000,000 to EarthLink upon termination of the merger
agreement by EarthLink; provided that EarthLink may elect in its notice of termination to waive its right to receive the $70,000,000 fee
in order to bring a claim for damages under the merger agreement.

In addition, EarthLink and Windstream will be obligated to reimburse the other party for up to ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in
incurred expenses if the merger agreement is validly terminated by either party because a party’s required stockholder approval is not
obtained.

Accounting Treatment (see page 157)

Windstream prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition
method of accounting. Windstream will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of EarthLink’s tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price being recorded as goodwill. Under GAAP, goodwill is not amortized
but is tested for impairment at least annually.

Appraisal Rights

Under the DGCL, neither Windstream stockholders nor EarthLink stockholders are entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in
connection with the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Comparison of Stockholder Rights and Corporate Governance Matters (see page 176)

differences between the governing corporate documents of EarthLink and the governing corporate documents of Windstream. These
differences are described in detail under the section entitled “Comparison of Rights of Windstream Stockholders and EarthLink
Stockholders” beginning on page 176.

(2)       In 2011, Windstream changed its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for pension benefits to recognize actuarial
gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. The effect of this change in
methodology can create volatility in actuarial gains and losses recognized based on market fluctuations which impacts pension
expense (income) for the year. Pension expense (income) was $1.2 million, $128.3 million, $(115.3) million, $67.4 million and
$166.8 million in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

 
(3) On November 30, 2011, Windstream acquired PAETEC Holding Corp., which affected Windstream’s historical operating

trends during 2012.
   
(4) Pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, Windstream Services, LLC sold a portion of Windstream's

data center business to TierPoint LLC (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Tierpoint), effective as of
December 18, 2015, and agreed to indemnify TierPoint for certain losses attributable to alleged breaches of representations and
warranties made by Windstream. Such indemnification liability is generally capped at $10.0 million. On November 22, 2016,
TierPoint submitted a notice of a claim for indemnification from Windstream and payment of $10.0 million. Windstream is
reviewing the factual basis for the claim and its legal defenses thereto. While a final determination has yet to be made, at this
time, it is reasonably possible that Windstream may pay up to $10.0 million to resolve the claim.

combined statement of operations data give effect to the closing of the mergers as if completed on January 1, 2015, and includes all
adjustments which give effect to the events that are directly attributable to the mergers, are expected to continue and that are factually
supportable. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data as of September 30, 2016 gives effect to the closing of
the mergers as if they had been completed on September 30, 2016 and includes all adjustments which give effect to the events that are
directly attributable to the mergers and that are factually supportable.

This information should be read in conjunction with the annual and quarterly reports and other information Windstream and EarthLink
have filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and with the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the
sections entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 200 and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Statements” beginning on page 158. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and does not indicate the financial results of the combined company had the mergers actually been completed
at the beginning of each period presented, nor the impact of possible business model changes. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information also does not consider any potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues, cost savings,
and asset dispositions, among other factors. In addition, as explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements, the aggregate value of purchase consideration and preliminary allocation of the pro
forma purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are subject to adjustment and may
vary significantly from the actual purchase price and allocation that will be recorded upon the closing of the mergers, which itself will
be subject to further adjustment for up to one year following the closing.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S.
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, (i)
statements about the benefits of the acquisition of EarthLink by Windstream, including financial and operating results and synergy
benefits that may be realized from the acquisition and the timeframe for realizing those benefits; (ii) Windstream’s and EarthLink’s
plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; (iii) other statements contained in this communication that are not historical facts; and
(iv) other statements identified by words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “goal,”
“strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” and words of similar meaning or similar references to future periods.

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, forward-looking statements are
based only on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations regarding the future of our business, including the effects of the mergers,
future plan and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-
looking statements relate to the future, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, risks
and contingencies, which may include third-party approvals, many of which are beyond Windstream’s and EarthLink’s control and are
difficult to predict. Therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of
the date hereof.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include
risks and uncertainties relating to the ability to obtain the requisite Windstream and EarthLink stockholder approvals required to
complete the mergers; the ability to satisfy the conditions to consummation of the mergers, including obtaining governmental and
regulatory approvals required for the mergers; the risk that required governmental and regulatory approvals may delay the mergers or
result in the imposition of conditions that could cause the parties to abandon the mergers or materially impact the financial benefits of
the proposed mergers; timing to consummate the proposed mergers; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the
risk that the cost savings and anticipated synergies from the proposed transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to
realize than expected; the anticipated future cash requirements of the proposed combined company; disruption from the proposed
transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the diversion of management
time on merger-related issues; dividend policy changes for the combined company; general worldwide economic conditions and related
uncertainties; and the effect of any changes in governmental regulations. These risks and uncertainties also include those set forth
under “Risk Factors,” beginning on page 36.

Other important factors that may affect Windstream’s and the combined business’ results of operations and financial condition include,
but are not limited to: (i) the continued expansion in consumption of data and video via the Internet by consumers and businesses; (ii)
continued uncertainty in the global financial markets and the global economy; (iii) disruptions in the financial markets that could affect
Windstream’s ability to obtain financing; and (iv) Windstream’s ability to: increase revenue from the services it offers; successfully use
new technology and information systems to support new and existing services; prevent process and system failures that significantly
disrupt the availability and quality of the services that it provides; prevent its security measures from being breached, or its services
from being degraded as a result of security breaches; develop new services that meet customer demands and generate acceptable

margins; effectively manage expansions to its operations; provide services that do not infringe the intellectual property and proprietary
rights of others; attract and retain qualified management and other personnel; and meet all of the terms and conditions of debt
obligations.

Additional information concerning these and other important factors can be found within Windstream’s and EarthLink’s filings with
the SEC, which discuss the foregoing risks as well as other important risk factors that could contribute to such differences or otherwise
affect their business, results of operations and financial condition. Statements in this communication should be evaluated in light of
these important factors. The forward-looking statements in this communication speak only as of the date they are made. Except for the
ongoing obligations of Windstream and EarthLink to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, Windstream and
EarthLink do not undertake any obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking
statement to reflect new information, circumstances or events that occur after the date such forward-looking statement is made unless
required by law.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters
addressed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the
following risk factors before deciding whether to vote for the merger proposal, the compensation proposal, in the case of EarthLink
stockholders, or for the proposals to approve the Windstream stock issuance and adoption of the Windstream charter amendment, in the
case of Windstream stockholders. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of EarthLink
and Windstream because these risks will relate to Windstream following the completion of the mergers. Descriptions of some of these risks
can be found in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and any amendments thereto, for each of
EarthLink and Windstream, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company’s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information
in this document and the other documents incorporated by reference into this document. See the section titled “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 200.

The exchange ratio will not be adjusted if the price of Windstream common stock declines before the merger is completed. As a result, the
value of the shares of Windstream common stock at the time EarthLink stockholders receive them could be less than the value of those
shares on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the EarthLink special meeting.

In the merger, EarthLink stockholders (other than holders of cancelled shares) will be entitled to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream
common stock for each share of EarthLink common stock owned by them as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Windstream common stock to which they otherwise would be entitled after giving effect to the
exchange ratio. Windstream and EarthLink will not adjust the exchange ratio as a result of any change in the market price of Windstream
common stock between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the date on which EarthLink stockholders receive shares of
Windstream common stock in exchange for their shares of EarthLink common stock. The market price of Windstream common stock will
likely be different, and may be lower, on the date on which EarthLink stockholders receive their shares of Windstream common stock than
the market price of Windstream common stock on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Differences in the market price of
Windstream common stock may be the result of changes in the business, operations or prospects of Windstream, market reactions to the
proposed mergers, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions or other factors.

Regulators may impose conditions that could prevent completion of the mergers or reduce the anticipated benefits from the mergers. As a
result, the price of Windstream common stock or EarthLink common stock may be adversely affected.

As a condition to their respective obligations to complete the mergers, Windstream and EarthLink must obtain the approval of various
regulatory authorities, including, without limitation, the DOJ, the FTC, the FCC and certain PSCs. The filings made with the FCC and
relevant PSCs are, in many cases, subject to third-party comments and protests. Any of these regulators could object to or deny approval
for the mergers and/or impose conditions or restrictions on their approvals that are materially adverse to Windstream, EarthLink and the
combined company. Depending on their nature and extent, any objections, conditions or restrictions of regulatory authorities may
jeopardize or delay completion of the mergers or may lessen or eliminate the anticipated potential benefits of the mergers. Under the
merger agreement, Windstream and EarthLink are obligated to use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections, conditions or
restrictions to permit the mergers to occur, but are not required to take any action that would have a material adverse effect on the assets,
liabilities, business, results of operations

or condition (financial or otherwise) of Windstream and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the mergers (measured on a
scale relative to Windstream and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the mergers).

Each of Windstream and EarthLink expects to incur significant non-recurring expenses related to the mergers.

Windstream and EarthLink are expected to incur significant non-recurring expenses related to the mergers and integration efforts. Neither
Windstream nor EarthLink can be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the
integration of the businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.

The merger agreement limits each of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective ability to pursue alternatives to the mergers, and in certain
instances requires payment of a termination fee, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction to the mergers.

While the merger agreement is in effect, subject to certain limited exceptions, each of EarthLink and Windstream is prohibited from
soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating, knowingly encouraging or entering into certain transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or
other business combination, with any third party. As a result of these limitations, EarthLink and Windstream may lose opportunities to
enter into a more favorable transaction than the mergers. See “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Transaction
Proposals” beginning on page 139 for a description of the foregoing limitations. Moreover, under specified circumstances, Windstream
and EarthLink may be required to pay the other a termination fee of $35,000,000 in connection with the termination of the merger
agreement, and Windstream may be required to pay EarthLink a termination fee of $70,000,000 in the event Windstream fails to close the
mergers when required under the merger agreement or breaches its covenant to keep sufficient funds available to consummate the mergers.
Additionally, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Windstream and EarthLink may be required to
reimburse the other for up to $10,000,000 of incurred expenses. See “The Merger Agreement—Payments” beginning on page 152 for a
description of the obligations in these services.

EarthLink will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed mergers are pending that could
adversely affect EarthLink’s business.

Uncertainty about the effect of the proposed mergers on EarthLink’s employees and customers may have an adverse effect on EarthLink’s
business. These uncertainties may impair EarthLink’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the proposed mergers are
completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with EarthLink to seek to change
existing business relationships with EarthLink. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the proposed
mergers, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite EarthLink’s retention
efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the
combined company, EarthLink’s business could be seriously harmed.

Windstream may not realize the anticipated synergies from the mergers.

Windstream expects to achieve annual operating and capital expense synergies. However, Windstream’s ability to realize the anticipated
synergies will depend upon the successful integration of EarthLink’s business with that of Windstream. Even if Windstream successfully
integrates EarthLink’s business, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefit of the
anticipated synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. For example, the elimination of duplicative
costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, benefits

37



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 52/364

from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating Windstream and EarthLink, or regulatory authorities may impose adverse
conditions on the combined company in connection with granting approval of the mergers.

EarthLink stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interests after the mergers and will exercise less influence over
management of Windstream than they currently exercise over management of EarthLink.

After the effective time of the mergers, EarthLink stockholders will own in the aggregate a smaller percentage of Windstream than they
currently own of EarthLink. Following completion of the mergers, EarthLink stockholders are expected to own approximately 47% of the
outstanding shares of Windstream common stock based on the number of shares of EarthLink common stock and Windstream common
stock outstanding on the record date for the special meetings of EarthLink and Windstream stockholders. Consequently, EarthLink
stockholders as a group will have less influence over the management and policies of Windstream than they currently exercise over the
management and policies of EarthLink.

EarthLink stockholders will have different rights with respect to their holdings following the mergers.

Upon completion of the mergers, EarthLink stockholders will become stockholders of Windstream. There are differences between the
rights of EarthLink stockholders under the EarthLink governing documents and the rights of Windstream stockholders under the
Windstream governing documents. For a description of some of these differences, see “Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of
Windstream and Common Stockholders of EarthLink” beginning on page 176.

Windstream cannot assure you whether, when or in what amounts it will be able to utilize EarthLink’s net operating losses following the
mergers.

Based on current tax law, EarthLink is estimated to have net operating losses (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
NOLs) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the closing of the mergers. After the mergers, the combined company’s ability to utilize
these tax attributes to offset future taxable income will be subject to significant limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.
Moreover, issuances or sales of Windstream stock following the mergers (including transactions outside of Windstream’s control) could
result in an ownership change further limiting the combined company’s ability to utilize these NOLs. Determining whether an ownership
change has occurred and the limitations applicable to the NOLs is technical and highly complex. For these and other reasons, Windstream
cannot assure you that the combined company will be able to use EarthLink’s NOLs after the mergers in the amounts it projects.

Failure to quickly and efficiently integrate EarthLink’s businesses, products and services could reduce Windstream’s profitability,
adversely affect its stock price, and either delay or prevent realization of many of the potential benefits of the mergers.

In order to obtain the benefits of the mergers, Windstream must effectively integrate EarthLink’s businesses, products and services with
Windstream’s businesses, products and services. Windstream may not be able to accomplish this integration quickly and effectively.
Windstream may be required to spend additional time and money on operating compatibility, which would otherwise be spent on selling its
own products and services and investing in its networks. If Windstream does not integrate operations effectively or uses too many
resources on integration, it could harm the combined company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

38



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 53/364

The time and effort required to be dedicated to the integration of EarthLink into Windstream could divert the attention of Windstream’s
management from other business concerns or otherwise harm Windstream’s business.

The integration process could result in the diversion of Windstream management’s attention from other business concerns, in the
disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in, Windstream’s ongoing business, or in inconsistencies in standards, controls,
procedures and policies. Any of these impacts could adversely affect Windstream’s ability to maintain relationships with its customers and
employees or Windstream’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers, or could reduce the earnings or otherwise adversely
affect Windstream’s business and financial results.

Under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Windstream, as amended by the Windstream charter amendment,
Windstream will be able to issue more shares of common stock than are expected to be outstanding immediately after the mergers are
completed. As a result, such future issuances of common stock may have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share and voting power of
Windstream’s stockholders.

If the mergers are completed, the Windstream charter amendment authorizes a greater number of shares of common stock than are
expected to be outstanding immediately after the mergers. If the Windstream Board elects to issue additional shares of common stock in
the future, whether in public offerings, in connection with mergers and acquisitions, for purposes of equity grants to Windstream
employees or otherwise, such additional issuances may dilute the earnings per share and voting power of the combined company’s
stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of their shares of Windstream common stock.

If your shares are held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust company or other nominee, you should follow the instructions of your
bank, broker, trust company or other nominee regarding the revocation of proxies.

All shares represented by valid proxies that are received through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, will be voted in accordance
with your instructions on the proxy card or as instructed via the Internet or telephone. If you are a stockholder of record and you make
no specification on your proxy card as to how you want your shares voted, your proxy will be voted “FOR” the Windstream stock
issuance proposal, “FOR” the Windstream charter amendment proposal and “FOR” the Windstream adjournment proposal.
According to the Windstream bylaws, only such business that is specified in Windstream’s notice of the meeting may be conducted at a
special meeting of stockholders.

Solicitation of Proxies

The solicitation of proxies from Windstream stockholders is made on behalf of the Windstream Board. In accordance with the merger
agreement, Windstream will bear the costs and expenses of proxy solicitation for the Windstream special meeting, and will bear the costs
and expenses it incurs in connection with the preparation and filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Windstream has retained
Okapi Partners LLC to aid in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $20,600, plus expenses. If necessary, Windstream may
also use several of its directors, officers and other regular employees, who will not be specially compensated except reimbursement for
actual expenses, to solicit proxies from Windstream stockholders, either personally or by telephone, facsimile, letter or other electronic
means. Windstream will also request that banks, brokers and other record holders forward proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial
owners of Windstream common stock and secure their voting instructions, and Windstream will provide customary reimbursement to such
firms for the cost of forwarding these materials. EarthLink will pay the costs of soliciting and obtaining its proxies and all other expenses
related to the EarthLink special meeting

Record Date

The close of business on January 23, 2017 has been fixed as the record date for determining the Windstream stockholders entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at the Windstream special meeting. At that time, 96,234,324 shares of Windstream common stock were
outstanding, held by approximately 24,363 holders of record.

Quorum

In accordance with the Windstream bylaws, stockholders who hold shares representing a majority of the outstanding shares of Windstream
common stock entitled to vote at the Windstream special meeting must be present or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at the Windstream special meeting. If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the shares of
Windstream common stock present or represented by proxy at the Windstream special meeting, and entitled to vote at the meeting, may
adjourn the Windstream special meeting to another time and place. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given
except by announcement of the time and place thereof at the meeting at which adjournment is taken.

If a holder of Windstream common stock is a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust company or other
nominee and does not provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions then, under applicable rules, the
organization that holds its shares may generally vote on “routine” matters but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters. If the organization
that holds its shares does not receive instructions from such stockholder on how to vote its shares on

a non-routine matter, that bank, broker, trust company or other nominee will inform the inspector of election at the Windstream special
meeting that it does not have authority to vote on the matter with respect to its shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.”
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of Windstream common stock represented at
the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Vote Required; Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Each share of Windstream common stock outstanding on the record date for the Windstream special meeting entitles the holder to one vote
with respect to such share on each matter to be voted upon at the Windstream special meeting. Each of the proposals has the following
vote requirement in order to be approved:

● assuming a quorum is present, approval of the Windstream stock issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes of Windstream common stock cast at the Windstream special meeting on such proposal;
 

● approval of the Windstream charter amendment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Windstream common stock entitled to vote on such proposal; and
 

● approval of the Windstream adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of Windstream common
stock cast at the Windstream special meeting on such proposal, if a quorum is present, or the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Windstream special meeting, and entitled to vote at the meeting, if a
quorum is not present.

Abstentions, failures to submit a proxy card or vote and broker non-votes will be treated in the following manner with respect to
determining the votes received for each of the proposals:

● with respect to stockholders of record, a failure to submit a proxy card or vote at the special meeting, by telephone or through the
Internet will have no effect on the Windstream stock issuance proposal or the Windstream adjournment proposal (whether or not a
quorum is present), but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream charter amendment proposal;
 

● an abstention will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream charter amendment proposal and, if a quorum is not present,
the Windstream adjournment proposal, but will have no effect on the Windstream stock issuance proposal or, if a quorum is
present, the Windstream adjournment proposal; and
 

● with respect to “street name” holders, a broker non-vote will be treated

● as a vote “AGAINST” the Windstream charter amendment proposal;
 

● if a quorum is not present and such share was instructed how to vote as to any other matter, as a vote “AGAINST” the
Windstream adjournment proposal;
 

● as having no effect on the Windstream stock issuance proposal or, if a quorum is present, the Windstream adjournment
proposal; and
 

● if a quorum is not present and such share was not instructed how to vote as to any other matter, as having no effect on the
Windstream adjournment proposal.

WINDSTREAM PROPOSALS

Item 1. The Windstream Stock Issuance Proposal

(Item 1 on Windstream Proxy Card)

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that Windstream stockholders approve the issuance of Windstream common stock to
EarthLink stockholders in the merger pursuant to the rules of the NASDAQ. When the merger becomes effective, each share of EarthLink
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger (other than the cancelled shares) will be converted into the right to receive
0.818 shares of Windstream common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the
closing of the mergers.

Under the NASDAQ’s Listing Rules, a company listed on the NASDAQ is required to obtain stockholder approval prior to the issuance of
securities in connection with the acquisition of the stock or assets of another company if, due to the present or potential issuance of
common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, among other things, (A) the common stock so issued has or
will have upon issuance voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance of stock (or
securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) or (B) the number of shares of common stock to be issued is or will be equal
to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the issuance of the stock or securities. If the merger is
completed, it is estimated, as of the record date for the Windstream and EarthLink special meetings, that Windstream will issue
approximately 86,441,730 shares of Windstream common stock in connection with the merger. The aggregate number of shares of
Windstream common stock issued in the merger will exceed 20% of the shares of Windstream common stock outstanding prior to such
issuance, as well as 20% of Windstream’s voting power outstanding prior to the issuance. For this reason, Windstream must obtain the
approval of Windstream stockholders for the issuance of shares of Windstream common stock to EarthLink stockholders in the merger.

The approval of the Windstream stock issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of Windstream common
stock cast at the Windstream special meeting on such proposal. The approval of the Windstream stock issuance proposal is necessary to
effect the mergers.

The Windstream Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Windstream stock issuance proposal (Item 1).

Item 2. The Windstream Charter Amendment Proposal

(Item 2 on Windstream Proxy Card)

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that Windstream stockholders approve the amendment of Windstream’s Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream charter),
pursuant to the DGCL. The Windstream charter currently provides that the total number of shares of Windstream stock which Windstream
has authority to issue is 200,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 33,333,333 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share and (ii)
166,666,667 shares of Windstream common stock.

In connection with the Windstream stock issuance contemplated by the merger agreement, the Windstream Board has proposed to increase
the number of shares of authorized common stock provided in its charter from 166,666,667 shares of common stock to 375,000,000 shares
of common stock. As of January 23, 2017, the record date for the Windstream and EarthLink special meetings, Windstream intends to
issue approximately 86,441,730 shares of Windstream common stock to EarthLink stockholders in the merger. The remaining proposed
shares would be utilized for general corporate purposes,

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 60/364

including for grants to employees pursuant to Windstream’s equity incentive plans and EarthLink’s equity incentive plans that will be
assumed by Windstream should the mergers become effective and for issuances in connection with future strategic opportunities that may
arise. The Windstream Board believes it is advisable to have additional authorized shares of Windstream common stock available for these
important corporate purposes, allowing Windstream the ability to react quickly to future strategic opportunities that may arise and to
attract and retain talented employees through the use of equity compensation.

The Windstream Board is submitting for consideration and approval by Windstream stockholders an amendment to increase the maximum
number of authorized shares of Windstream common stock from 166,666,667 shares of common stock to 375,000,000 shares of common
stock, and thereby increasing the total number of Windstream’s authorized shares from 200,000,000 shares to 408,333,333 shares.
Windstream intends to file the amendment, if approved by Windstream’s stockholders, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
prior to the effectiveness of the merger. The full text of the form of proposed amendment is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

The approval of the Windstream charter amendment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Windstream common stock entitled to vote on such proposal. The approval of the Windstream charter amendment proposal is
necessary to effect the mergers.

The Windstream Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Windstream charter amendment proposal (Item 2).

Item 3. The Windstream Adjournment Proposal

(Item 3 on Windstream Proxy Card)

The Windstream special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place to solicit additional proxies if Windstream has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Windstream common stock to approve the Windstream stock issuance proposal and
the Windstream charter amendment proposal.

If, at the Windstream special meeting, the number of shares of Windstream common stock present or represented and voting in favor of the
Windstream stock issuance proposal or the Windstream charter amendment proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal, Windstream
intends to move to adjourn the Windstream special meeting in order to enable the Windstream Board to solicit additional proxies for
approval of the Windstream stock issuance proposal and the Windstream charter amendment proposal.

In the Windstream adjournment proposal, Windstream is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the
Windstream Board to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxyholders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the
Windstream special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the Windstream stockholders
approve the Windstream adjournment proposal, Windstream could adjourn the Windstream special meeting and any adjourned session of
the Windstream special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from
Windstream stockholders who have previously delivered proxies not in favor of the Windstream stock issuance proposal or the
Windstream charter amendment proposal.

If a quorum is present, the approval of the Windstream adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of
Windstream common stock cast at the Windstream special meeting on such proposal. If a quorum is not present, the approval of the
Windstream adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting.

The Windstream Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Windstream adjournment proposal (Item 3).

If a holder of EarthLink common stock is a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust company or other
nominee and does not provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions then, under applicable rules, the
organization that holds its shares may generally vote on “routine” matters but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters. If the organization
that holds its shares does not receive instructions from such stockholder on how to vote its shares on a non-routine matter, that bank,
broker, trust company or other nominee will inform the inspector of election at the EarthLink special meeting that it does not have
authority to vote on the matter with respect to its shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.” Abstentions and broker non-
votes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of EarthLink common stock represented at the special meeting for
purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. However, if a beneficial owner of EarthLink common stock does not
instruct its broker, bank, trust company or other nominee how to vote on any matter, the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee will
not have discretion to vote on any proposal at the EarthLink special meeting and the shares will not be in attendance at the meeting or
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Vote Required; Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Each share of EarthLink common stock outstanding on the record date for the EarthLink special meeting entitles the holder to one vote on
each matter to be voted upon at the EarthLink special meeting. Each of the proposals has the following vote requirement in order to be
approved:

● approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of EarthLink
common stock entitled to vote on the proposal; and
 

● approval of each of the EarthLink adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present) and the compensation proposal
(assuming a quorum is present) requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the number of shares of EarthLink stock
entitled to vote present in person or represented by proxy at the EarthLink special meeting.

Abstentions, failures to submit a proxy card or vote in person and broker non-votes will be treated in following manner with respect to
determining the votes received for each of the proposals:

● with respect to stockholders of record, a failure to submit a proxy card or vote in person, by telephone, or through the Internet will
have no effect on the EarthLink adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal, but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the
merger proposal;
 

● an abstention will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, the EarthLink adjournment proposal and the
compensation proposal; and
 

● with respect to “street name” holders,

● a share not in attendance at the EarthLink special meeting because the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee has
received no instructions regarding how to vote on any matter will have no effect on the EarthLink adjournment proposal or the
compensation proposal, but will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal; and
 

● a broker non-vote will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, the EarthLink adjournment proposal (whether or

The EarthLink Board urges EarthLink stockholders to promptly vote by completing, dating and signing the accompanying proxy
card and returning it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope; calling the toll-free number listed in the proxy card

voting instructions of your bank, broker, trust company or other nominee.

EarthLink stockholders may also vote at the EarthLink special meeting by ballot. Votes cast at the meeting, in person or by proxy, will be

Voting Power of EarthLink’s Directors and Executive Officers

On the record date for the EarthLink special meeting, the directors and executive officers of EarthLink and their affiliates owned and were
entitled to vote 1,253,211 shares of EarthLink’s common stock, representing 1.2% of the outstanding EarthLink common stock.

Recommendation of the EarthLink Board

The EarthLink Board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, including the mergers, and

compensation proposal. See the section titled “The Mergers—EarthLink’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of EarthLink’s
Board of Directors” beginning on page 66 for a more detailed discussion of the EarthLink Board’s recommendation.

Attending the EarthLink Special Meeting

Only stockholders who own EarthLink common stock as of the close of business on the record date (and their duly authorized
proxyholders) will be entitled to attend the special meeting. Proof of stock ownership (or proxy authority) as of this date and some form of
government issued photo identification (such as a valid driver’s license or passport) will be required for admission to the special meeting.
If you hold your shares of EarthLink common stock in a brokerage account or through another nominee, you are the beneficial owner of
those shares but not the record holder and you will need to obtain a “legal proxy” from the record holder to attend the special meeting.

THE EARTHLINK PROPOSALS

Item 1. The Merger Proposal

(Item 1 on EarthLink Proxy Card)

As discussed throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus, EarthLink is asking its stockholders to approve the merger proposal.
Holders of EarthLink common stock should read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety, including the Annexes
hereto, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the mergers. In particular, holders of EarthLink common stock
are directed to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Approval of the
merger proposal is required for completion of the mergers.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of EarthLink common stock entitled to vote on such proposal is
required to approve the merger proposal.

The EarthLink Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the merger proposal (Item 1).

Item 2. The EarthLink Adjournment Proposal

(Item 2 on EarthLink Proxy Card)

The EarthLink special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place to solicit additional proxies if EarthLink has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of EarthLink common stock to approve the merger proposal.

If, at the EarthLink special meeting, the number of shares of EarthLink common stock for which EarthLink has received proxies in favor
of the merger proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal, EarthLink intends to move to adjourn the EarthLink special meeting in
order to enable the EarthLink Board to solicit additional proxies for approval of the merger proposal.

In the EarthLink adjournment proposal, EarthLink is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the
EarthLink Board to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxyholders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the
EarthLink special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If EarthLink stockholders approve the
EarthLink adjournment proposal, EarthLink could adjourn the EarthLink special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from EarthLink stockholders who have previously delivered proxies not in favor of the
merger proposal.

Whether or not a quorum is present, approval of the EarthLink adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority
of the number of shares of EarthLink stock entitled to vote present in person or represented by proxy at the EarthLink special meeting.

The EarthLink Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the EarthLink adjournment proposal (Item 2).

Item 3. The Compensation Proposal

(Item 3 on EarthLink Proxy Card)

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act of 1934 and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, which were enacted pursuant to
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, EarthLink is required to submit a
proposal to EarthLink stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by EarthLink of certain compensation to the
named executive officers of EarthLink that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. This proposal, commonly known as the “say-
on-golden parachute” proposal and which EarthLink refers to as the compensation proposal, gives EarthLink stockholders the opportunity
to vote on a non-binding, advisory basis on the compensation that EarthLink’s named executive officers may be entitled to receive from
EarthLink that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers.

The compensation that EarthLink’s named executive officers may be entitled to receive from EarthLink that is based on or otherwise
relates to the mergers is summarized and included in the section entitled “The Mergers—Interests of EarthLink’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Mergers—Quantification of Potential Payments to EarthLink’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers”
beginning on page 115. That summary includes all compensation and benefits that may be paid or become payable to EarthLink’s named
executive officers by EarthLink that are based on or otherwise relate to the mergers.

The EarthLink Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The EarthLink Board unanimously recommends that EarthLink’s stockholders approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of EarthLink approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable to EarthLink’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section entitled ‘The Mergers—Interests of EarthLink’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers—
Quantification of Potential Payments to EarthLink’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.’”

Because the vote on the compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either EarthLink or Windstream. Accordingly, if
the merger agreement is adopted and the mergers are completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of EarthLink’s stockholders.

The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the number of shares of EarthLink stock entitled to vote present in person or represented
by proxy at the EarthLink special meeting is required to approve the compensation proposal.

The EarthLink Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the compensation proposal (Item 3).

THE MERGERS

Effects of the Mergers

In the merger, Merger Sub 1, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream that was formed for the purpose of effecting the
mergers, will merge with and into EarthLink, with EarthLink continuing as the surviving corporation. In the subsequent merger, which will
occur immediately following the merger, the surviving corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub 2, an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Windstream that was formed for the purpose of effecting the mergers, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving
company.

In the merger, each share of EarthLink common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto (other than the cancelled shares)
will be converted into the right to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Windstream common stock to which a holder of EarthLink common stock otherwise would be entitled to receive after giving effect to the
exchange ratio. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the mergers.
Based on the closing price of Windstream common stock on the NASDAQ on November 3, 2016, the last trading day before media reports
of the possibility of a transaction were published, the merger consideration represented approximately $5.55 in value for each share of
EarthLink common stock. Based on the closing price of Windstream common stock on January 23, 2017, the latest practicable trading day
before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the merger consideration represented approximately $6.76 in value for each share
of EarthLink common stock. Windstream stockholders will continue to hold their existing shares of Windstream common stock.

Background of the Mergers

Windstream, a Fortune 500 company and leading provider of advanced network communications and technology solutions for consumers,
businesses, enterprise organizations and wholesale customers, was formed in July 2006 through Alltel Corporation’s spinoff of its wireline
telecommunications division and subsequent merger with VALOR Communications Group, Inc. Since its formation, Windstream has
engaged in numerous discussions with a number of telecommunications-related companies regarding a variety of possible business
opportunities in connection with the consolidation in the telecommunications industry during the past decade. These discussions ranged
from possible commercial or partnering arrangements to possible acquisitions or other business combinations. From 2006 to the present,
Windstream grew rapidly through a number of targeted, strategic acquisitions, which enabled Windstream to transform from a traditional
rural-focused telephone company to a nationwide enterprise communications and service provider with a local and long-haul fiber network
comprised of approximately 129,000 route miles, while realizing significant synergies from the increased scale the acquisitions brought to
its overall operations. These acquisitions have permitted Windstream to expand its network infrastructure to offer advanced IP-based voice
and data services, such as MPLS networking, cloud computing, managed hosting and managed services, to business customers and TDM
special access, Ethernet, Wave transport and other wholesale voice and data services to carriers and network operators, while still
delivering telephone, broadband, and related services to over one million primarily rural residential customers. These acquisitions served
Windstream’s goal of expanding in strategic growth areas to enhance its competitiveness, to better serve customers, and to deliver value to
its stockholders, even as the telecommunications industry trended toward consolidation.

Similar to Windstream, the EarthLink Board and its management regularly review EarthLink’s results of operations, prospects and
competitive position in the business segments in which it operates, as well as business opportunities and strategic alternatives. In
connection with these reviews, EarthLink from time to time evaluates potential transactions which would further its strategic objectives,
and the potential

54



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 69/364

benefits and risks of those transactions in light of, among other things, the consolidation that has been occurring in the telecommunications
industry and EarthLink’s competitive position. In addition, from time to time, the members of EarthLink’s senior management team meet
with the senior management of other companies within the telecommunications industry to discuss industry developments and potential
strategic transactions.

In 2014 and 2015, in addition to strategic business opportunities, Windstream began evaluating other unique ways to accelerate network
investments and reduce debt. In July 2014, Windstream announced plans to spin off certain of its fiber and copper telecommunications
network assets and other real estate into an independent, publicly traded real estate investment trust, Communications Sales & Leasing,
Inc. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as CS&L), and enter into a master lease agreement to lease those network
assets back from CS&L (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the REIT Spin-Off). In connection with the REIT
Spin-Off, which was completed in April 2015, and the subsequent monetization of Windstream’s approximate 20 percent retained equity
interest in CS&L, Windstream reduced its debt by approximately $3.9 billion. Additionally, in December 2015, Windstream sold its tier
one data center business (14 of its 27 data centers) for approximately $575 million in cash, allowing it to further reduce debt and make
targeted investments in its core network.

Upon Joseph Eazor’s commencement of employment as EarthLink’s President and Chief Executive Officer in 2014, he began a strategic
assessment of EarthLink’s business in order to discover opportunities to improve the company’s operations and financial performance.
This assessment resulted in a more focused, market based strategy for each of EarthLink’s customer segments, with an emphasis on being
a leading managed network services provider for multi-location retail and services businesses. The company also aligned its organization
into business units to better serve its customer segments and streamline operations. EarthLink’s operating improvements resulted in
improved financial performance and a stronger balance sheet. However, while these improvements were occurring, the EarthLink Board
also acknowledged the continuing industry challenges facing EarthLink and its growth prospects as a stand-alone entity in a consolidating
industry. These challenges include growing revenues from growth products and services to offset declining revenues in other products and
services, responding to increased market competition, including competition with companies with greater scale, aligning costs with trends
in revenues and ensuring adequate resources to invest in growth.

During the period from 2014 and continuing through the announcement of the merger agreement with Windstream in November 2016, the
EarthLink Board regularly reviewed and evaluated its strategic plans and objectives as a regular topic of discussion at its meetings, which
discussions included multiple specific potential strategic alternatives. As part of this process, in the summer of 2014 EarthLink engaged
Foros Securities LLC (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Foros) as its independent financial advisor to assist the
EarthLink Board and management in their review of these strategic alternatives. As a result of this review of strategic alternatives, from
time to time since the summer of 2014, EarthLink has held discussions with a number of potential financial and strategic parties regarding
possible transactions, both in response to unsolicited inquiries and following contacts made by EarthLink. In addition to these various
discussions, the EarthLink Board also continued to review other potential strategic alternatives.

As part of Windstream’s ongoing evaluation of business opportunities in the telecommunications industry and EarthLink’s ongoing review
and evaluation of its strategic plans and objectives, representatives of EarthLink and Windstream had several calls, meetings and other
communications in 2014 and 2015 regarding enhanced commercial agreements and/or various business combination alternatives, none of
which resulted in any agreement or understanding with respect to a business combination because, at

55



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 70/364

the time of such discussions, Windstream remained focused on the REIT Spin-Off and monetizing its retained CS&L equity stake prior to
pursuing strategic initiatives and EarthLink continued to review other potential strategic alternatives.

In June 2016, Windstream completed the monetization of its retained equity stake in CS&L. In August 2016, the Windstream Board and
management began discussing broader long-term strategic alternatives, which included a review of a number of possible opportunities and
potential transaction partners. Following the regularly scheduled quarterly Windstream Board meeting on August 3, 2016, Windstream
management began preparing an M&A readiness workplan, including assembling a core team of internal senior leaders by business unit
that would be ready to source, investigate and evaluate potential strategic opportunities, as and when they developed.

On September 1, 2016, Tony Thomas, Windstream’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Eazor had a call to discuss ongoing
commercial negotiations regarding network access between the companies, the potential opportunity for a broader commercial
arrangement and whether a strategic business combination would be beneficial to the companies and their stockholders. Mr. Thomas noted
that strategic conversations would need to wait until Windstream concluded certain pending financing transactions but commercial
negotiations could continue. Messrs. Thomas and Eazor agreed to meet again in October 2016 to measure progress on the commercial
arrangements under negotiation and whether a broader discussion between each company’s respective management teams was warranted.

Later in the day on September 1, the EarthLink Board held a previously scheduled telephonic meeting to discuss strategic alternatives,
with members of EarthLink management and a representative of Troutman Sanders LLP (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Troutman Sanders), EarthLink’s outside counsel, in attendance. During this meeting, Mr. Eazor informed the other
members of the EarthLink Board about his conversation with Mr. Thomas.

As Windstream completed its work assessing the EarthLink network in September 2016, it became evident that the ability to drive large
cost savings through each company’s respective networks would make a strategic business combination between the companies very
compelling. Following discussions between Messrs. Eazor and Thomas in early October 2016, the parties confirmed that they would hold
an in-person meeting among the Windstream and EarthLink management teams on October 4, 2016, and that the principal topic for that
meeting would be to discuss a possible strategic combination. In furtherance of that discussion, on October 3, 2016, Windstream and
EarthLink entered into a confidentiality agreement to permit the exchange of non-public information. Following execution of the
confidentiality agreement, the parties exchanged discussion materials prepared for the October 4, 2016 management meeting.

On October 4, 2016, members of EarthLink’s and Windstream’s management, including Messrs. Thomas and Eazor, met in Atlanta and
discussed the companies’ respective businesses, including selected financial and other business information. At the conclusion of the
meeting, Mr. Thomas informed Mr. Eazor that Windstream would likely submit an indication of interest to EarthLink by October 6, 2016
for a strategic combination of the two companies. Mr. Eazor promptly informed the other members of the EarthLink Board of this
development, which scheduled a telephonic board meeting for October 7, 2016 in anticipation of receiving Windstream’s indication of
interest by October 6.

On October 5, 2016, the Windstream Board met with Windstream management to discuss a potential strategic combination transaction
with EarthLink and feedback from the management meetings. The Windstream Board reviewed and considered proposed terms of an
indication of interest to provide to EarthLink, which included a fixed exchange ratio, a potential cash component, a customary termination
fee, no financing condition and an opportunity for EarthLink to designate one individual to the

56



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 71/364

Windstream Board, and engaged in a discussion regarding the proposed pro forma dividend policy of the combined company. The
Windstream Board also evaluated the potential transaction in light of Windstream’s net operating losses and its ability to finance a
transaction with EarthLink, including the repayment or replacement of EarthLink’s existing indebtedness.

Following the October 5 Windstream Board meeting, Mr. Thomas sent Mr. Eazor Windstream’s non-binding preliminary indication of
interest (which we refer to as Windstream’s October 5 proposal). Windstream’s October 5 proposal contemplated a merger between the
two companies in which each share of EarthLink common stock would be exchanged for 0.7 shares of Windstream common stock (which
implied a 12.9% premium to EarthLink’s 10-day average exchange ratio of 0.62x), which could include some per share portion in cash,
with the final amount of any cash consideration to be determined in Windstream’s discretion. In addition to the amount of proposed merger
consideration, the proposal contemplated the following key terms: (1) a non-solicitation covenant restricting EarthLink’s ability to solicit
alternative transactions and a termination fee in the amount of $35 million to be payable by EarthLink to Windstream to accept a superior
alternative, but also a “force the vote” provision requiring EarthLink to submit the merger agreement with Windstream to a vote of
EarthLink stockholders even if the EarthLink Board changed its recommendation; (2) the absence of any financing condition to
Windstream’s obligation to consummate the proposed transaction; (3) one EarthLink director would be appointed to the Windstream Board
at closing; and (4) an approximately 30-day pre-signing exclusive negotiation period for Windstream to complete due diligence and
negotiate definitive transaction agreements. In delivering the proposal, Mr. Thomas highlighted some of the reasons for EarthLink to
consider a potential combination, including that the two companies could create more value together than apart, that EarthLink
stockholders would own approximately 45% of the combined company, that substantial synergies would be expected from the combination
and that the amount of the dividend currently paid to EarthLink stockholders would likely increase following the transaction.

Over the next several days, Windstream management continued due diligence reviews of EarthLink, and on October 7, 2016, with the
guidance of the Windstream Board, engaged J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as J.P.
Morgan) to serve as its financial advisor on the potential transaction. J.P. Morgan was engaged because it is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the proposed transaction and has routinely provided
Windstream with strategic and industry related advice. Based on J.P. Morgan’s lack of any disclosed potential conflicts of interest,
familiarity with Windstream and Windstream’s business and qualifications, Windstream determined that J.P. Morgan was qualified to serve
as its independent financial advisor.

On October 7, 2016, the EarthLink Board met telephonically to discuss Windstream’s October 5 proposal with EarthLink’s senior
management and representatives of Foros and Troutman Sanders. During the course of this meeting, the attendees first received a
presentation from management reviewing the directors’ consideration of strategic alternatives to date, including the proposed transaction
with Windstream and alternative business combinations EarthLink had considered but which were not completed. Mr. Eazor also provided
an overview of Windstream’s business based on the October 4 management meeting and discussed his views of the potential benefits of a
transaction with Windstream, including the increased scale that could be added to EarthLink’s business units, the more extensive
nationwide network for EarthLink’s products that could result from a combination, the potential improvement in “on-net” services and
resulting cost advantages, and the substantial synergies that could be created in such a transaction. During this meeting, representatives of
Foros also reviewed with the EarthLink Board certain financial aspects of Windstream’s October 5 proposal and a preliminary financial
analysis of the combined business. After discussion and consultation with its advisors, the

57



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 72/364

EarthLink Board determined that, while Windstream’s October 5 proposal was inadequate and that accepting it would not be in the best
interests of EarthLink’s stockholders, it was sufficiently attractive to warrant continued discussions and negotiations with Windstream
regarding a potential business combination. In this regard, the EarthLink Board continued to acknowledge EarthLink’s competitive
challenges as a stand-alone entity but also believed that in light of EarthLink’s improved financial performance and stronger balance sheet,
EarthLink could negotiate more favorable transaction terms with Windstream that would be in the best interests of EarthLink’s
stockholders. The EarthLink Board directed management to work together with Foros to propose for the directors’ review and
consideration a counterproposal to Windstream and to present that counterproposal to the EarthLink Board at a future meeting. The
EarthLink Board also determined, based in part on the views expressed by management and the representatives of Foros regarding the
company’s previous outreach efforts and discussions with other parties as well as other factors relating to the M&A environment generally,
not to direct Foros or management to contact or solicit alternative potential counterparties at that time. Among other things, the EarthLink
Board concluded based on input from management and its advisors that there likely were no alternative counterparties that were currently
interested in and financially capable of acquiring EarthLink and that, even if there were such counterparties, Windstream’s October 5
proposal contemplated EarthLink’s ability to negotiate with respect to and potentially accept unsolicited superior proposals. However, the
EarthLink Board also decided not to grant Windstream’s request for a 30-day exclusive negotiation period, and directed Foros and
management to reject that aspect of Windstream’s proposal.

During the October 7 EarthLink Board meeting, the representative of Troutman Sanders also reviewed with the members of the EarthLink
Board their fiduciary duties as directors of a Delaware corporation in considering the proposed transaction. In connection with that review,
the EarthLink Board considered and discussed Foros’s qualifications to continue to serve as EarthLink’s independent financial advisor in
connection with the proposed transaction with Windstream. Based on Foros’s lack of any disclosed potential conflicts of interest,
substantial experience in transactions similar to the proposed transaction, reputation in the investment community and familiarity with
EarthLink and EarthLink’s business, the EarthLink Board determined that Foros remained qualified to serve as its independent financial
advisor. During this discussion, the EarthLink Board also discussed the advisability of engaging a second independent financial advisor in
light of the significance of the proposed transaction to EarthLink, its business and its stockholders and directed management to contact
Goldman, Sachs & Co. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Goldman Sachs) regarding a potential engagement,
and EarthLink ultimately engaged Goldman Sachs as an additional financial advisor. The EarthLink Board determined to contact and
engage Goldman Sachs because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions
similar to the proposed transaction. Goldman Sachs also informed EarthLink that it had concluded that, in its opinion, nothing would limit
its ability to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to EarthLink in connection with the contemplated transaction. The EarthLink
Board considered disclosures made by Goldman Sachs to EarthLink and made an independent determination that Goldman Sachs was
qualified to serve as the EarthLink Board’s independent financial advisor. Additionally, the representative from Troutman Sanders led the
EarthLink Board in a discussion regarding the company’s publicly disclosed change in control arrangements and other compensation
matters with EarthLink’s officers and directors that would be affected by a transaction with Windstream. Following these discussions, the
EarthLink Board scheduled another telephonic meeting for October 10, 2016 to review and consider a proposed counterproposal to
Windstream’s October 5 proposal.

In advance of the October 10 EarthLink Board meeting, EarthLink management provided the EarthLink Board the Windstream
management presentation that was presented to EarthLink management at the October 4 meeting in Atlanta. At the telephonic board
meeting held on October 10, with members of management and representatives of Foros and Troutman Sanders present, the EarthLink
Board again reviewed the financial aspects of Windstream’s October 5 proposal and a proposed counterproposal. After discussion and
consultation with its advisors, the EarthLink Board directed Mr. Eazor to deliver

58



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

a counterproposal (which we refer to as EarthLink’s October 10 proposal) to Windstream. EarthLink’s October 10 proposal contemplated
the following key revisions to Windstream’s October 5 proposal: (1) an increase in the exchange ratio from 0.7 to 0.8 shares of
Windstream common stock for each share of EarthLink common stock and for any cash consideration to be “mutually agreed” upon by the
parties; (2) a reduction of the termination fee to be paid by EarthLink to accept an unsolicited superior proposal from $35 million to $25
million; (3) removal of the “force the vote” requirement if the EarthLink Board were to change its recommendation regarding the proposed
transaction; (4) an increase in the number of EarthLink directors to be appointed to the combined company’s board from one to not less
than one-third of the total board size; (5) payment of a special dividend to EarthLink stockholders immediately prior to closing equalizing
(after giving effect to the exchange ratio) the per share dividends received by EarthLink and Windstream stockholders between signing and
closing pursuant to the companies’ respective existing dividend policies; (6) the parties must mutually agree before signing upon the
dividend policy for the combined company; and (7) rejection of Windstream’s request for a 30-day exclusive negotiation period. During
the meeting, the attendees also discussed engaging, and ultimately engaged Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (which we
refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Paul, Weiss) as special legal counsel in connection with the transaction. The EarthLink
Board determined to engage Paul, Weiss based on its experience, qualifications and reputation in advising public companies in transactions
of the kind contemplated by Windstream’s October 5 proposal.

Following the October 10 EarthLink Board meeting, Mr. Eazor sent EarthLink’s October 10 proposal to Mr. Thomas.

On October 11, 2016, the Windstream Board met to discuss EarthLink’s October 10 proposal. After evaluating, among other things, the
terms of EarthLink’s counterproposal, as well as the advice of its financial and legal advisors, the Windstream Board authorized
management to engage in further negotiations and additional diligence activities with EarthLink to determine if Windstream and EarthLink
could reach agreement on the terms of a proposed business combination. The Windstream Board also authorized management to deliver a
revised proposal to EarthLink (which we refer to as Windstream’s October 11 proposal) that included: (1) a 0.75 exchange ratio; (2)
increased the potential cash component up to $1.00 per share of EarthLink common stock at the discretion of Windstream; (3) a
termination fee payable by EarthLink upon entering into a superior proposal in the amount of $35 million, with no “force the vote”
requirement; (4) up to three directors to be appointed to the combined company’s board by EarthLink and with the combined company’s
board size to be set at twelve directors; and (5) maintenance of Windstream’s existing $0.60 per share dividend policy following the
transaction, at the discretion of the Windstream Board.

On October 12, 2016, the EarthLink Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss Windstream’s October 11 proposal. Members of
EarthLink’s senior management and representatives of Foros, Paul, Weiss and Troutman Sanders were present at the meeting. EarthLink’s
senior management and the representatives of Foros discussed with the directors various financial aspects of Windstream’s October 11
proposal, including the companies’ respective financial profiles, a relative contribution analysis and an analysis at various exchange ratios.
In addition, EarthLink’s management discussed the necessary due diligence to fully evaluate the potential benefits and considerations of
the proposed transaction, including its recommendation to engage Ernst & Young LLP (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as EY) to assist with due diligence relating to accounting and tax matters. Following these discussions, the EarthLink
Board directed management to continue its due diligence and to engage EY as recommended. The EarthLink Board also determined after
discussion and consultation with its advisors that Windstream’s October 11 proposal remained inadequate and directed management

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

to send a revised counterproposal (which we refer to as EarthLink’s October 12 proposal) contemplating: (1) that the exchange ratio be in
the range of 0.75 to 0.8 shares of Windstream common stock per share of EarthLink common stock and subject to continuing negotiation;
(2) that any additional cash consideration be in an amount agreed to by EarthLink prior to signing; (3) that the amount of the termination
fee payable by EarthLink be in a range of $25 million to $35 million and subject to continuing negotiation; (4) clarification that the
EarthLink Board would be free to change its recommendation or terminate the merger agreement to accept an unsolicited superior
proposal; (5) that the number of EarthLink directors appointed to the combined company’s board of directors be in the range of three to
four and subject to continuing negotiation; and (6) that EarthLink stockholders receive a special dividend at closing to equalize the per
share dividend differential paid to EarthLink and Windstream stockholders between signing and closing.

Following the EarthLink Board meeting on October 12, Mr. Eazor provided EarthLink’s October 12 proposal to Mr. Thomas. After
discussion of the revised term sheet and the parties’ respective determinations that the broad terms of the proposal were sufficiently
compelling to continue negotiations, the parties made available their respective electronic data rooms and commenced due diligence of
non-public materials. Thereafter and continuing until the execution of the merger agreement on November 5, 2016, the management teams
of Windstream and EarthLink, together with their respective financial, legal and accounting advisors, performed reciprocal due diligence
reviews through a series of in-person and telephonic discussions and review of publicly available information and non-public information
made available by each party.

During the week of October 17, 2016, EarthLink and Windstream management, along with representatives of Foros, Goldman Sachs, EY
and J.P. Morgan held numerous in person and telephonic due diligence meetings, including in-person meetings on October 18, 19 and 20
in Atlanta.

The EarthLink Board met telephonically on October 21, 2016 with representatives of management, Foros, Goldman Sachs, Paul, Weiss
and Troutman Sanders present. At the meeting, EarthLink management provided an update on the status of ongoing due diligence of each
party’s respective businesses and analysis of the potential synergies to be realized in the proposed transaction. The representatives of Foros
then discussed with the EarthLink Board an updated preliminary analysis of the combined company. A representative of Paul, Weiss
provided a detailed overview of the EarthLink directors’ fiduciary duties and legal standards applicable to their decisions and actions with
respect to their evaluation of the proposed transaction and answered questions regarding certain expected terms of the draft merger
agreement based on the preliminary proposals exchanged between the parties from October 5 through 12, including, among others,
EarthLink’s ability to consider, negotiate and enter into unsolicited superior proposals after signing an agreement with Windstream and the
termination fee payable by EarthLink to Windstream to accept such a superior proposal.

The parties continued to perform due diligence throughout the week of October 24, 2016, including analysis of Windstream’s available
financing for a transaction.

On October 24, 2016, Windstream’s legal advisor, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Skadden), provided an initial draft of a proposed merger agreement to Paul, Weiss. Also on October 24,
Windstream contacted Barclays Capital Inc. (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Barclays) to evaluate the
fairness to Windstream of the exchange ratio with respect to the possible transaction with EarthLink. Barclays was engaged because of its
familiarity with Windstream and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions generally, as well as its substantial experience in transactions comparable to the proposed transaction.

On October 26, 2016, the EarthLink Board met in person for a regularly scheduled meeting, which was attended in person by
representatives of management, Foros, Goldman Sachs and Troutman Sanders and telephonically by representatives of Paul, Weiss. During
the meeting, the EarthLink directors, members of management and their advisors again discussed the status of negotiations, including due
diligence, with Windstream and the strategic rationale of the proposed transaction. In connection with that discussion, the representatives
from each of Foros and Goldman Sachs discussed with the EarthLink Board various financial aspects of the proposed transaction. A
representative of Paul, Weiss also reviewed with the EarthLink Board key issues raised by the first draft of the proposed merger
agreement, including most notably that the exchange ratio and amount of additional cash to be paid as merger consideration remained
subject to continuing negotiation; the absence of committed financing or any representations or covenants as to Windstream’s availability
of funds pre-closing to consummate the transactions contemplated by the draft proposed merger agreement, including primarily to repay or
otherwise discharge EarthLink’s outstanding indebtedness, and the related absence of any termination fee payable by Windstream to
EarthLink if Windstream failed to consummate the proposed transaction when required under the proposed merger agreement, whether
due to its inability to obtain financing or otherwise; the limited scope of Windstream’s interim operating restrictions covenants; and the
absence of any non-solicitation covenant applicable to Windstream between signing and closing. At the conclusion of the foregoing
discussions and in consultation with its advisors, the EarthLink Board directed management and its independent financial and legal
advisors to continue due diligence and negotiation efforts, stressing the importance of obtaining (1) Windstream’s acceptance of the 0.8
exchange ratio EarthLink had proposed, (2) effective assurances regarding Windstream’s availability of funds and (3) reciprocal interim
operating and non-solicitation covenants applicable to Windstream. The EarthLink Board also discussed the advisability of meeting Mr.
Thomas in person.

Mr. Eazor spoke with Mr. Thomas the following day to relay the key open issues identified by the EarthLink Board and to request a
meeting between Mr. Thomas and the EarthLink Board, which was subsequently scheduled for November 2, 2016 in Atlanta. Later in the
day on October 27, Paul, Weiss sent a revised version of the proposed merger agreement to Skadden, which among other things addressed
the key issues identified by EarthLink Board at its October 26 meeting, including providing for reciprocal interim operating and non-
solicitation covenants, a covenant requiring Windstream to keep sufficient funds available in a segregated account between signing and
closing to be used solely in connection with consummating the proposed transaction and a termination fee to be payable by Windstream to
EarthLink if Windstream breached that covenant or otherwise failed to close when required under the proposed merger agreement.

Messrs. Eazor and Thomas spoke several times on October 29, 2016 regarding the terms of the proposed transaction. In the last of these
conversations on October 29, Mr. Thomas informed Mr. Eazor that Windstream would agree to an all-stock transaction at an exchange
ratio of 0.8. Also on October 29 and again on October 30, Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective chief financial officers had a number
of discussions regarding Windstream’s financing plans for the proposed transaction, the availability of funds under its existing credit
facility and whether Windstream would be willing to agree to keep sufficient funds available in a segregated account between signing and
closing and to be used solely in connection with the consummation of the proposed transaction.

On October 31, 2016, Skadden sent a revised draft of the proposed merger agreement to Paul, Weiss. Among other things, this revised
draft provided for an all-stock transaction at a 0.8 exchange ratio, Windstream to maintain available funds at all times until closing to
consummate the proposed transaction taking into account availability under its credit facility and without requiring that such funds be
maintained in a segregated account, Windstream to pay a termination fee in the amount of $35 million if it failed to close when required
and various limitations and restrictions on EarthLink’s ability to grant employee compensation between signing and closing, including a
prohibition on granting any equity compensation.

Later in the day on October 31, the EarthLink Board held a telephonic meeting, also attended by representatives from management, EY,
Foros, Goldman Sachs, Paul, Weiss and Troutman Sanders. During the meeting, management updated the EarthLink Board regarding its
due diligence review of Windstream. EY also reported to the Board regarding its review of Windstream accounting and tax matters.
Representatives of Paul, Weiss and the financial advisors discussed with the EarthLink Board remaining material open items in the revised
draft of the proposed merger agreement. After discussion and consultation with its advisors, the EarthLink Board directed Paul, Weiss to
continue its negotiation efforts to obtain greater certainty from Windstream regarding its contractual obligations to keep funds available to
consummate the proposed transaction, a larger termination fee payable by Windstream if it breached its financing or closing obligations,
and greater flexibility regarding EarthLink’s ability to issue equity and other compensation to employees between signing and closing.

Thereafter, representatives of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective management teams, Skadden and Paul, Weiss held several
discussions on October 31 and November 1, 2016 regarding the open issues in the revised draft of the proposed merger agreement. On
November 1, Messrs. Eazor and Thomas also discussed these open issues.

On November 1, 2016, Windstream reviewed Barclays’ disclosure regarding conflicts, which Windstream determined did not indicate any
material conflicts in connection with the proposed transaction with EarthLink. Windstream executed an engagement letter with Barclays
for the purpose of Barclays’ evaluating the fairness to Windstream of the exchange ratio with respect to the possible transaction with
EarthLink on a non-contingent fee basis.

On November 2, 2016, Paul, Weiss sent a revised version of the proposed merger agreement to Skadden.

Later in the day on November 2, the EarthLink Board met in person in Atlanta with representatives from management, Foros and Goldman
Sachs in attendance and representatives from Goldman Sachs, Paul, Weiss and Troutman Sanders participating by phone. During the
meeting, Mr. Eazor updated the directors on the status of negotiations regarding the remaining open issues in the proposed merger
agreement, including EarthLink’s proposal that, if Windstream failed to satisfy its financing covenant or failed to close when required,
EarthLink would be entitled to terminate the agreement and demand a $70 million termination fee as well as sue for any additional
damages it suffered above $70 million. The representatives of Foros and Goldman Sachs also discussed with the EarthLink Board various
financial aspects of the proposed transaction. Mr. Thomas then joined the meeting and met in executive session with the non-management
members of the EarthLink Board. During this portion of the meeting, Mr. Thomas discussed with the EarthLink directors his background
and information regarding strategy, synergies, integration planning and financing plans. At the conclusion of that discussion, Mr. Thomas
left the meeting and Mr. Eazor rejoined the meeting. The EarthLink Board then again discussed the key

open issues in the proposed merger agreement. A representative from Troutman Sanders also discussed with the EarthLink Board
information regarding the interests of EarthLink’s officers and directors in the proposed transaction resulting from publicly-disclosed
change in control arrangements.

Following the meeting, Messrs. Eazor and Thomas met in person and discussed the status of the potential transaction. Later in the day on
November 2, representatives of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective management teams, Skadden and Paul, Weiss again met by
phone to discuss the remaining open issues in the proposed merger agreement, including Windstream’s financing covenant, the related
termination fee to be payable by Windstream and other remedies available to EarthLink if Windstream breached that covenant or failed to
close when required, and employee compensation and retention matters.

On November 3, 2016, representatives of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective management teams, Skadden and Paul, Weiss
exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and held extensive discussions regarding the remaining open issues in the proposed merger
agreement, after which Paul, Weiss sent another revised draft of the proposed merger agreement to Skadden, reflecting the parties’
agreement (subject to their respective boards’ approval) on the outstanding open issues, including, among other items, Windstream’s
agreement to maintain through closing available funds necessary to consummate the proposed transaction, taking into account
Windstream’s unrestricted cash, availability under its credit facility, the proceeds of any subsequent borrowings or financings permitted by
the agreement and incurred for the primary purpose of consummating the proposed transaction and any commitment letter issued by a
financing source for the primary purpose of providing funds to finance the proposed transaction in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to EarthLink; EarthLink’s right to terminate the agreement if Windstream breaches that covenant or fails to close when required
and, in connection with such termination, elect either to receive a termination fee payable by Windstream in the amount of $70 million or
to pursue an action for damages; and sufficient flexibility regarding EarthLink’s ability to issue equity and other compensation to
employees between signing and closing.

On the evening of November 3, 2016, Mr. Eazor contacted Mr. Thomas to discuss his concern that the implied transaction premium based
on the proposed exchange ratio had decreased to low single digits based on each company’s respective stock price. Messrs. Eazor and
Thomas agreed to continue to monitor each company’s respective stock price and to discuss further after the market closed on November
4, 2016.

On November 3, 2016, a reporter from Reuters contacted each of the corporate communications teams of the parties, as well as certain of
the parties’ respective advisors, seeking comment on reports of a potential transaction between the two companies. Although neither
company nor any of their representatives provided any comment, Reuters published an article on the morning of November 4, 2016,
indicating that the two companies were in discussions with respect to a potential transaction.

On November 4, 2016, the Windstream Board held its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting, with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Barclays
and Skadden participating. At the meeting, members of Windstream senior management reviewed with the Windstream Board certain
aspects of the proposed transaction and the other matters described below under “—Windstream’s Reasons for the Mergers;
Recommendation of Windstream’s Board of Directors.” A representative of Skadden summarized the status of negotiations with respect to
the proposed merger agreement, including a detailed discussion of the terms of the proposed transaction. The Skadden representative
further advised the Windstream Board regarding certain considerations under Delaware law pertaining to the duties of a board of directors
in connection with the evaluation of a business combination. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Barclays reviewed with the Windstream
Board their respective financial analyses of the 0.80 exchange ratio. The Windstream Board also discussed the intraday trading levels of
each party and the likelihood that EarthLink may request an adjustment to the exchange ratio.

Following these presentations, and after further discussion and consideration, the Windstream Board approved the merger agreement on
the terms presented. The Windstream Board recommended that Windstream issue shares of Windstream common stock to EarthLink
stockholders in connection with the merger and that such recommendation be submitted to the Windstream stockholders for their approval
in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Windstream Board also unanimously approved an amendment to the Windstream charter
to increase its authorized common stock from 166,666,667 shares to 375,000,000 shares to provide sufficient shares of Windstream
common stock to issue in the transaction, subject to Windstream stockholder approval. The Windstream Board also unanimously
recommended that the Windstream stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the Windstream charter amendment and “FOR” the approval
of the Windstream stock issuance.

During the day on November 4, Mr. Eazor called Mr. Thomas to express concern regarding the proposed 0.8 exchange ratio in light of the
market’s reaction to the Reuters publication and requested that Windstream increase the proposed exchange ratio. EarthLink common
shares closed on November 4, 2016 at $6.22 per share, a 14.8% increase over the closing price per share of EarthLink common stock on
November 3, 2016.

After market close on November 4, the EarthLink Board met telephonically, with representatives from management, Foros, Goldman
Sachs, Paul, Weiss and Troutman Sanders in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Eazor again reviewed with the attendees the strategic
rationale for the proposed transaction and the company’s prior consideration of strategic alternatives as well as the substantial progress that
had been made on the proposed merger agreement since the EarthLink Board’s November 2, 2016 meeting. He also informed the attendees
of his discussions with Mr. Thomas during the day regarding proposed changes to the exchange ratio. Following that discussion, a
representative from Paul, Weiss again reviewed with the EarthLink directors their fiduciary duties with respect to their evaluation of the
proposed transaction and provided a detailed overview of the terms of the draft merger agreement and related documents. The
representatives from Foros next reviewed with the EarthLink Board Foros’s financial analysis of the proposed transaction. The EarthLink
Board, management and the EarthLink Board’s legal and financial advisors then again discussed the renewed negotiations regarding the
proposed exchange ratio.

Following the EarthLink Board meeting, Mr. Eazor contacted Mr. Thomas to discuss the significant increase in EarthLink’s stock price
since the publication of news reports of the potential merger and requested that Windstream increase the proposed exchange ratio to reflect
the premium expected by EarthLink’s stockholders. Throughout the evening, each company’s respective advisors discussed the terms of
the proposed transaction and possible methods of, and merits to, increasing the transaction consideration, including additional cash
consideration, paying EarthLink stockholders a special dividend or increasing the exchange ratio. After further discussion and analysis, the
management teams of both parties agreed to present to their boards for approval an increase in the proposed exchange ratio to 0.818
Windstream shares for each EarthLink share. Based upon this further revised exchange ratio, it is estimated that, upon the closing of the
mergers, existing Windstream stockholders will own approximately 51% of the outstanding shares of Windstream and former EarthLink
stockholders will own approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of Windstream. Each party's ownership percentages of the combined
company were negotiated on the basis of Windstream's and EarthLink's respective equity values as of September 30, 2016 and reflect
Windstream's desire to deliver a premium on the price per share of EarthLink common stock to be paid to EarthLink stockholders in the
merger. Although Windstream is a larger company than EarthLink, it has higher leverage than EarthLink, which makes the equity values
of each company similar.

On November 5, 2016, the Windstream Board held a special meeting to discuss the revised transaction terms with representatives of
Barclays and Skadden. Management discussed with the Windstream Board the negotiations with EarthLink over the previous 24 hours. In
addition, representatives of Barclays reviewed with the board its financial analysis of the revised exchange ratio and delivered to the
Windstream Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 5, 2016, a copy
of which is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, to the effect that, as of November 5, 2016 and based upon and
subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the exchange ratio to be paid by Windstream was fair to
Windstream, from a financial point of view. Following these presentations, and after further discussion and consideration, the Windstream
Board unanimously determined that the transaction was advisable, and that it is in the best interests of Windstream and its stockholders to
enter into the merger agreement on the revised terms presented to the Windstream Board.

The EarthLink Board also held a telephonic meeting on the morning of November 5, 2016, along with representatives from management,
Foros, Goldman Sachs, Paul, Weiss and Troutman Sanders. Mr. Eazor first reported the outcome of the prior evening’s negotiations and
Windstream’s agreement to increase the exchange ratio to 0.818. The representative of Paul, Weiss then again discussed with the
EarthLink Board their fiduciary duties in evaluating the proposed transaction and the final terms of the proposed merger agreement.
Representatives of Foros reviewed with the EarthLink Board Foros’s financial analyses of the exchange ratio and delivered to the
EarthLink Board an opinion, dated November 5, 2016, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
EarthLink common stock, which is summarized in the section entitled “—Opinions of EarthLink’s Financial Advisors—Foros Securities
LLC” beginning on page 71 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Representatives of Goldman Sachs next reviewed with the EarthLink
Board Goldman Sachs’s financial analyses of the exchange ratio and delivered to the EarthLink Board an opinion, dated November 5,
2016, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth
therein, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than
Windstream and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of EarthLink common stock, which is summarized in the section entitled “—
Opinions of EarthLink’s Financial Advisors—Goldman, Sachs & Co.” beginning on page 81 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
After further discussion and consultation with their advisors, including consideration of the factors described in the section entitled “—
EarthLink’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of EarthLink’s Board of Directors” beginning on page 66 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the EarthLink Board unanimously determined that the proposed merger agreement, the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of EarthLink and its stockholders and unanimously
approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The
EarthLink Board also directed the officers of the company to execute and deliver to Windstream and thereafter to cause EarthLink to
perform the merger agreement, resolved that the merger agreement be submitted to the EarthLink stockholders for their approval and
recommended that the EarthLink stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and “FOR” the compensation proposal.

Later on November 5, Mr. Eazor executed and delivered the merger agreement on behalf of EarthLink and Mr. Thomas executed and
delivered the merger agreement on behalf of Windstream. For a discussion of the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 124 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 80/364

Prior to the opening of the U.S. financial markets on November 7, 2016, Windstream and EarthLink issued a joint press release
announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the proposed combination.

EarthLink’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of EarthLink’s Board of Directors

In evaluating the merger agreement and the mergers, the EarthLink Board consulted with and received the advice of EarthLink’s
management and legal and financial advisors and, in reaching its decision at its meeting on November 5, 2016 to approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to recommend that EarthLink’s stockholders vote “FOR” the
merger proposal, the EarthLink Board considered a number of factors in respect of the mergers, including, but not limited to, the following
(not necessarily in order of relative importance):

Merger Consideration

● the merger consideration to be paid per share of EarthLink common stock consisted of 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock,
which represents a 13% premium to the average exchange ratio of 0.721 over the 30-day period ended November 3, 2016 (the last
unaffected trading day before rumors about a possible transaction between EarthLink and Windstream were published by Reuters);
 

● the course and history of the negotiations between EarthLink and Windstream, in which EarthLink was able to negotiate for an
increase in the exchange ratio to be received by EarthLink stockholders, but which also led the EarthLink Board to believe,
based on Windstream’s positions during such negotiations, that the exchange ratio was the maximum exchange ratio that
Windstream would be willing to agree to in the mergers; and
 

● the fact that the mergers are expected to be completed as a tax-free reorganization for the purposes of U.S. federal income tax;

Strategic Considerations

● the mergers will likely provide a number of significant strategic opportunities that EarthLink would not have as a stand-alone
company, including the following:
 
○ EarthLink and Windstream have been successful recently in transforming their respective businesses, and the combined

company likely will be able to build on these successes and accelerate progress;
 

○ EarthLink participates in a consolidating industry and the combined company will have increased scale and scope, giving it
the ability to leverage complementary strategies and business units across a broader platform and be a stronger competitor in
its industry and markets;
 

○ the mergers will result in an extensive national footprint spanning approximately 145,000 fiber route miles with more on-net
services;
 

○ the combined company will be able to provide customers with an expanded and diverse set of advanced network
connectivity, managed services, voice, internet and other value-added services;

66



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 81/364

○ customers of the combined company will also benefit from the addition of the scale of Windstream’s assets bringing value
to EarthLink’s existing business;
 

○ the combined company will have a better revenue trajectory; and
 

○ the combined company will be a financially stronger company than either EarthLink or Windstream standing alone before
the mergers, benefiting from a more diverse revenue base and an increase in free cash flow;

Synergies and NOLs

● based on the advice of EarthLink management following such management’s discussions with Windstream management and
EarthLink’s advisors, the mergers likely will create greater than $125 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies
expected to be realizable within three years of closing; and
 

● the expectation that the combined company will benefit from utilization of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective
accumulated net operating losses after the closing;

Ability to Participate in Future Appreciation and Dividends

● the mergers provide EarthLink stockholders with the opportunity to participate in the equity value of the combined company,
including the possible future industry competitiveness, revenue growth and expected synergies resulting from the mergers, with
an implied ownership in the combined company of between 48-49% (as of November 4, 2016);
 

● consistent with Windstream’s current dividend practice, the Windstream Board expects to maintain its annual dividend of $0.60
per share after the transaction closes, providing meaningful benefits to stockholders in the form of long-term capital returns; and
 

● this dividend also represents a substantial increase in the annual dividend currently received by EarthLink stockholders;

Board Representation

● three of the twelve members to serve on the Windstream Board following the mergers will be selected by EarthLink, provided
they are reasonably acceptable to Windstream based on Windstream’s normal corporate governance process for evaluating
candidates for the Windstream Board;

Financial Advisors’ Opinions

● the opinion of Foros, dated November 5, 2016, to the EarthLink Board to the effect that, as of the date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, the exchange ratio was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of EarthLink common stock, as more fully described below in the section entitled “—
Opinions of EarthLink’s Financial Advisors”; and
 

● the opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated as of November 5, 2016, to the EarthLink Board that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than Windstream and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of
EarthLink common stock, as more fully described below in the section entitled “— Opinions of EarthLink’s Financial
Advisors”;

Alternatives

● the merger consideration to be paid per share of EarthLink common stock of 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock,
together with the potential value creation from the combination of the two companies, was more favorable to EarthLink’s
stockholders than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to EarthLink, including, but
not limited to, the continued operation of EarthLink on a stand-alone basis, in light of a number of factors, including the
following:
 
○ the benefits, potential risks and uncertainties associated with the mergers as compared to those of other potential strategic

alternatives that might be available to EarthLink, as well as those of remaining as a stand-alone entity, in the context of
EarthLink’s business, assets and prospects, its historical and projected financial performance and the opportunities and
challenges facing EarthLink and its industry, as well as broader economic developments affecting its businesses;
 

○ the strategic and other alternatives reasonably available to EarthLink, including the alternative of remaining a stand-alone
public company, in light of a number of factors and the potential risks and uncertainties associated with those alternatives,
none of which other alternatives was deemed likely to result in value to EarthLink’s stockholders that would exceed, on a
present-value basis, the value of the merger consideration;
 

○ Windstream was the most logical strategic partner in a consolidating industry in light of its complementary products and
strategic position and the potential for the realization of synergies, such that a business combination transaction with
Windstream was most likely to provide the highest long-term value to EarthLink’s stockholders; and
 

○ the feasibility of executing other hypothetical strategic alternatives; and
 

● the EarthLink Board’s view that the terms of the merger agreement would not preclude or otherwise limit any third party with
the financial capability and strategic interest of acquiring EarthLink from pursuing a potential superior proposal;

High Likelihood of Completion

● the likelihood of completion of the mergers was high, particularly in light of the terms of the merger agreement, including its
covenants and closing conditions, as well as the commitment of each of EarthLink and Windstream to use reasonable best
efforts to complete the mergers and, subject to certain limitations, to avoid or resolve any impediment under antitrust laws that
may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement

● the merger agreement would require Windstream to pay EarthLink $35 million if the merger agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances;
 

● the merger agreement provides EarthLink the right to elect to require Windstream to pay EarthLink $70 million if EarthLink
terminates the merger agreement due to Windstream’s failure to close the mergers when required under the merger agreement or
maintain sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

● Windstream is required to reimburse EarthLink for its fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby up to a maximum of $10 million if Windstream’s stockholders fail to vote in favor of the
Windstream stock issuance or the Windstream charter amendment.

The EarthLink Board also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties in its deliberations concerning the mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (not necessarily in order of relative
importance):

● the risk that the potential benefits of the mergers (including the amount of synergies) may not be fully or partially achieved, or may
not be achieved within the expected time frame; 
 

● the risks and costs to EarthLink if the mergers are not completed, including the potential diversion of management and
employee attention, potential employee attrition and the potential effects on business and customer and supplier relationships; 
 

● the potential challenges and difficulties relating to integrating the operations of EarthLink and Windstream after consummation
of the mergers, including the cost to achieve synergies, which will require consolidating certain businesses and functions,
integrating organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures of the two
companies and retaining key personnel, and may disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses or create inconsistencies which
adversely affect relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others;
 

● the risk that the trading of Windstream’s common stock is more volatile than EarthLink’s;
 

● the risk that Windstream is more leveraged than EarthLink;
 

● the risk of diverting management focus and resources from operating EarthLink’s businesses, as well as other strategic
opportunities, and potential disruption associated with combining and integrating the companies;
 

● the fact that following the closing of the mergers, the existing directors of Windstream will constitute a majority of the
Windstream Board, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Windstream will continue in these roles, and the
extent to which members of EarthLink management join the combined company is uncertain;
 

● the risk that because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the consideration to EarthLink stockholders in the mergers could
fluctuate between signing and closing the mergers, including after the EarthLink stockholder meeting;
 

● certain provisions of the merger agreement could have the effect of discouraging third party offers for EarthLink, including the
restriction on EarthLink’s ability to solicit third party proposals for alternative transactions involving EarthLink and the
termination fee EarthLink would be required to pay Windstream to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal from a third party;
 

● the circumstances in which Windstream may terminate the merger agreement, including to enter into a superior proposal or if
the EarthLink Board changes its recommendation in favor of the mergers;
 

● the risk that EarthLink stockholders or Windstream stockholders may fail to adopt or approve, as applicable, the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby;

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

● that the merger agreement would require EarthLink to pay Windstream $35 million in the case the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the EarthLink Board or a termination of
the merger agreement by EarthLink to enter into a binding agreement providing for a superior alternative transaction (see “The
Merger Agreement — Payments” beginning on page 152), and the potential that such fee might affect the potential for
EarthLink to receive alternative strategic transaction proposals both during the pendency of the merger as well as afterward
should the mergers not be consummated;
 

● that EarthLink is required to reimburse Windstream for its fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby up to a maximum of $10 million if EarthLink’s stockholders fail to vote in favor of
the mergers;
 

● the restrictions on the conduct of EarthLink’s business prior to the completion of the mergers, which restrictions generally
require EarthLink to operate its businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with limited
exceptions, which may delay or prevent EarthLink from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion
of the mergers;
 

● the potential for litigation challenging the mergers, and the possibility that an adverse judgment for monetary damages could
have a material adverse effect on the operations of the combined company after the mergers or that an adverse judgment
granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin completion of the mergers;
 

● the risk that regulatory, governmental or competition authorities might seek to impose conditions on or otherwise prevent or
delay the mergers, or impose restrictions or requirements on the operation of the businesses of Windstream after completion of
the mergers;
 

● the fees and expenses associated with completing the mergers; and
 

● various other risks associated with the combination and the businesses of EarthLink and Windstream described under “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 36.

The EarthLink Board concluded that these potential risks and uncertainties were outweighed by the benefits that the EarthLink Board
expected EarthLink and its stockholders to achieve as a result of the mergers. The EarthLink Board realized that there can be no assurance
about future results, including results considered or expected as disclosed in the foregoing reasons.

In addition to considering the factors described above, the EarthLink Board considered that some officers and directors of EarthLink have
interests in the mergers as individuals that are in addition to, and that may be different from, the interests of EarthLink stockholders
generally (see “— Interests of EarthLink Directors and Officers in the Mergers” beginning on page 110 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus).

The above discussion of the material factors considered by the EarthLink Board in its consideration of the mergers and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement is not intended to be exhaustive, but does set forth the principal factors considered by the
EarthLink Board. In light of the number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with the evaluation of the mergers, the
EarthLink Board did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors it considered in reaching its final decision. The EarthLink Board viewed its position as being based on all of the information
available to it and the factors presented to and considered by it. However, some directors may themselves have given different weight to
different factors. The factors, potential risks and uncertainties contained in this explanation of EarthLink’s reasons for the mergers

In arriving at its opinion, Foros assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Foros, including
without limitation the Windstream Projections, EarthLink Projections and synergies, and relied upon the assurances of the managements of
EarthLink and Windstream that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or
misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Windstream Projections, Foros assumed, at the direction of the EarthLink Board
and without independent verification, that such forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Windstream as to the future financial performance of Windstream, and, at the
direction of the EarthLink Board, Foros relied upon the Windstream Projections for purposes of its analysis. With respect to the EarthLink
Projections, Foros assumed, at the direction of the EarthLink Board and without independent verification, that such forecasts had been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of EarthLink as
to the future financial performance of EarthLink. With respect to the synergies, Foros assumed, at the direction of the EarthLink Board and
without independent verification, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good
faith judgments of the management of EarthLink as to the matters covered thereby, and Foros assumed, at the direction of the EarthLink
Board and without independent verification, that the synergies would be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.

Foros did not make, and was not provided with, any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of EarthLink or Windstream, nor did Foros make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of EarthLink or
Windstream. Foros did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of EarthLink, Windstream or the combined company under any state, federal
or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Foros assumed, at the direction of the EarthLink Board, that the
mergers would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition
or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and
waivers for the mergers, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on EarthLink or
Windstream or the contemplated benefits of the mergers. Foros also assumed, at the direction of the EarthLink Board, that the mergers
would qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Foros expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the mergers (other than the exchange ratio to the extent expressly
specified therein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the mergers. Foros was not authorized by EarthLink or the
EarthLink Board to solicit, and did not solicit, interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or any part of
EarthLink or any alternative transaction. Foros’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of
EarthLink common stock of the exchange ratio, and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration received in
connection with the mergers by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion
or view was expressed with respect to the fairness of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers,
directors or employees of any party to the mergers, or class of such persons relative to the exchange ratio or otherwise. Furthermore, no
opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be
available to EarthLink or in which EarthLink might engage or as to the underlying business decision of EarthLink to proceed with or effect
the mergers. Foros did not express any opinion as to what the value of Windstream common stock actually would be when issued or the
prices at which Windstream common stock would trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the mergers.

Foros’s opinion was not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to members of the EarthLink Board as to whether they
should approve the mergers or the merger agreement, and Foros expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder
should vote or act in connection with the mergers or any related matter.

Foros’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as they existed
and could be evaluated on, and the information made available to Foros as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that
subsequent developments may affect Foros’s opinion, and Foros does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The
issuance of Foros’s opinion was approved by Foros’s Opinion Committee.

The following represents a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Foros to the EarthLink Board in connection with
Foros’s opinion. The order of the analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given by Foros to those analyses.
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full
text of each summary and are not alone a complete description of Foros’s financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables
below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Foros. Except as otherwise noted, the
following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before
November 3, 2016, which was the last full trading day prior to a published article describing rumors about a possible transaction between
EarthLink and Windstream, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Furthermore, any estimates contained in these
analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than as set forth below.

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis

Foros reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for EarthLink and Windstream to corresponding financial
information, ratios and public market multiples for certain publicly traded telecommunications companies (which we refer to in this
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Selected Companies). The Selected Companies are as follows:

Selected Companies

● CenturyLink, Inc.
 

● Cincinnati Bell Inc.
 

● Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc.
 

● FairPoint Communications, Inc.
 

● Frontier Communications Corporation
 

● GTT Communications, Inc.
 

● Internap Corporation
 

● Level 3 Communications, Inc.
 

● Lumos Networks Corp.
 

● Vonage Holdings Corp.

Foros calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on closing market share prices and other publicly available
historical financial data for the Selected Companies, EarthLink and Windstream, and selected Wall Street research, FactSet and public
filings and, with respect to EarthLink and Windstream, the EarthLink Projections and the Windstream Projections.

The Selected Companies were selected by Foros because they were deemed to be similar to EarthLink and Windstream in one or more
respects, including the nature of their business, size and financial performance. No company used in this analysis is identical or directly
comparable to EarthLink or Windstream. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this
analysis involved complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which EarthLink and Windstream were compared. Foros believed
that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the Selected Companies analysis. Foros also
made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of
EarthLink and Windstream, respectively, and the Selected Companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide
a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.

For each of the Selected Companies, Foros calculated and analyzed the following:

● ratio of enterprise value, defined as equity market value plus indebtedness, the value of any preferred stock (at liquidation
value) and minority interest and less cash and cash equivalents, to estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense and pension expense (which, for the Selected Companies, we refer to in this
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EBITDA), for the calendar year 2016, or 2016E EBITDA, and calendar year
2017, or 2017E EBITDA; and

75



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 91/364

● the ratio of enterprise value to estimated unlevered free cash flow, or UFCF, defined as EBITDA less capital expenditures, for
the calendar year 2016, or 2016E UFCF, and calendar year 2017, or 2017E UFCF.

Each of these calculations was performed and based on publicly available financial data. This analysis indicated that the multiples of the
Selected Companies were between 5.1x and 11.4x 2016E EBITDA (compared to EarthLink at 4.6x Adjusted EBITDA, which, as used in
this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, means EarthLink’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA, as reflected in the EarthLink
Projections, and Windstream at 5.4x Adjusted EBITDAR, which, as used in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, means
Windstream’s estimated Adjusted EBITDAR, as reflected in the Windstream Projections), 4.8x and 11.2x 2017E EBITDA (compared to
EarthLink at 5.0x Adjusted EBITDA and Windstream at 5.5x Adjusted EBITDAR), 7.7x and 16.7x 2016E UFCF (compared to EarthLink
at 7.7x UFCF, which, as used in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, means EarthLink’s estimated Unlevered Free Cash
Flow, as reflected in the EarthLink Projections, and Windstream at 12.2x UFCF, which, as used in this section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, means Windstream’s estimated EBITDAR less capital expenditures, as reflected in the Windstream Projections as
adjusted by EarthLink), and 7.8x and 33.0x 2017E UFCF (compared to EarthLink at 9.2x UFCF and Windstream at 9.8x UFCF).

EarthLink

Based on its qualitative judgments concerning the differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects
of EarthLink and the Selected Companies, Foros selected enterprise value to EBITDA multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.0x for calendar
year 2017. Applying these selected multiples to the corresponding financial data for EarthLink Adjusted EBITDA, Foros derived an
implied per share equity reference range for EarthLink of approximately $5.51 to $7.28, compared to the closing per share price of
EarthLink common stock on November 3, 2016 of $5.42.

Windstream

Based on its qualitative judgments concerning the differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects
of Windstream and the Selected Companies, Foros selected enterprise value to EBITDA multiples ranging from 5.5x to 6.0x for calendar
year 2017. Applying these selected multiples to the corresponding financial data for Windstream Adjusted EBITDAR, Foros derived an
implied per share equity reference range for Windstream of approximately $6.90 to $16.02, compared to the closing per share price of
Windstream common stock on November 3, 2016 of $6.78.

Relative Value Analysis

Using the implied per share equity reference ranges of EarthLink and Windstream derived from the Selected Companies analyses
summarized above, Foros calculated an implied exchange ratio range of 0.344 to 1.055, compared to the exchange ratio of 0.818. Foros
calculated the top end of the foregoing implied exchange ratio range by dividing the top end of EarthLink’s implied per share price derived
from the Selected Companies analysis summarized above by the bottom end of Windstream’s implied per share price derived from the
Selected Companies analysis summarized above, and calculated the bottom end of the foregoing implied exchange ratio range by dividing
the bottom end of EarthLink’s implied per share price derived from the Selected Companies analysis summarized above by the top end
Windstream’s implied per share price derived from the Selected Companies analysis summarized above.

Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis

Foros performed a present value of future share prices analysis for each of EarthLink and Windstream, which analysis is designed to
provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company as a function of the company’s future earnings. The resulting implied
future share price and anticipated cash dividends are subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the present value for the
company’s potential future share price.

EarthLink

In arriving at the estimated implied per share prices of EarthLink common stock, Foros applied multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.0x to
EarthLink’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the next twelve months (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as NTM)
as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Foros then discounted the share prices and dividends to be paid on
EarthLink common stock through December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 based on EarthLink’s current dividend
policy to present value as of October 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 11.5%, which rate was selected based on EarthLink’s estimated cost
of equity. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share prices for EarthLink common stock as of October 31, 2016 of approximately
$5.54 to $7.30, compared to the closing per share price of EarthLink common stock on November 3, 2016 of $5.42.

In arriving at the estimated implied per share prices of EarthLink common stock, Foros also applied multiples ranging from 8.5x to 10.5x
to EarthLink’s estimated NTM UFCF as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Foros then discounted the
share prices and dividends to be paid on EarthLink common stock through December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31,
2018 based on EarthLink’s current dividend policy to present value as of October 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 11.5%, which rate was
selected based on EarthLink’s estimated cost of equity. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share prices for EarthLink common
stock as of October 31, 2016 of approximately $4.86 to $6.75, compared to the closing per share price of EarthLink common stock on
November 3, 2016 of $5.42.

Windstream

In arriving at the estimated implied per share prices for Windstream common stock, Foros applied multiples ranging from 5.5x to 6.0x to
Windstream’s estimated NTM Adjusted EBITDAR as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Foros then
discounted the share prices and dividends to be paid on Windstream common stock through December 31, 2018 based on Windstream’s
current dividend policy to present value as of October 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 12.5%, which rate was selected based on
Windstream’s estimated cost of equity. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share prices for Windstream common stock as of
October 31, 2016 of approximately $6.78 to $16.99, compared to the closing per share price of Windstream common stock on November
3, 2016 of $6.78.

In arriving at the estimated implied per share prices for Windstream common stock, Foros also applied multiples ranging from 9.5x to
10.5x to Windstream’s estimated NTM UFCF as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Foros then
discounted the share prices and dividends to be paid on Windstream common stock through December 31, 2018 based on Windstream’s
current dividend policy to present value as of October 31, 2016 using a discount rate of 12.5%, which rate was selected based on
Windstream’s estimated cost of equity. This analysis indicated a range of implied per share prices for Windstream common stock as of
October 31, 2016 of approximately $4.02 to $18.93, compared to the closing per share price of Windstream common stock on November
3, 2016 of $6.78.

Relative Value Analysis

Using the implied per share equity reference ranges of EarthLink and Windstream derived from the present value of future share price
analyses summarized above based on EarthLink’s estimated NTM Adjusted EBITDA and Windstream’s estimated NTM Adjusted
EBITDAR as of December 31, 2018, Foros calculated an implied exchange ratio range of 0.352 to 0.838, compared to the exchange ratio
of 0.818. Foros determined the low end of the foregoing implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of EarthLink’s present
value of future share price as of December 31, 2018 ($5.57) by the high end of Windstream’s present value of future share price as of
December 31, 2018 ($15.80), and determined the high end of the foregoing implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high end of
EarthLink’s present value of future share price as of December 31, 2018 ($6.99) by the low end of Windstream’s present value of future
share price as of December 31, 2018 ($8.34).

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Foros performed a discounted cash flow analysis (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a DCF
analysis or DCF) utilizing the EarthLink Projections and the Windstream Projections.

EarthLink

Foros calculated the net present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax, free cash flows that EarthLink was forecasted to generate,
defined as EarthLink’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation and amortization, less cash restructuring expense, less stock-based
compensation expense, less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures and plus changes in net working capital,
derived using the EarthLink Projections, from the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2019 and of terminal
values for EarthLink, plus the present value of the cash tax savings from EarthLink’s federal and state net operating loss carryforwards,
estimated by EarthLink management. Implied terminal values were derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to
3.0%. Present values (as of October 31, 2016) of cash flows and terminal values were then calculated using discount rates of 8.3% to
8.8%, based on EarthLink’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Present values of net operating loss carryforwards were calculated
using EarthLink’s estimated cost of equity of 11.5%. The discounted cash flow analysis resulted in an implied per share present value
range for EarthLink common stock of approximately $5.18 to $8.30, compared to the closing per share price of EarthLink common stock
on November 3, 2016 of $5.42.

Windstream

Foros calculated the net present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax, free cash flows that Windstream was forecasted to generate,
defined as Windstream’s estimated Adjusted EBITDAR less depreciation and amortization, less cash restructuring expense, less stock-
based compensation expense, less pension expense, less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures and plus
changes in net working capital, derived using the Windstream Projections as adjusted by EarthLink, from the fourth quarter ending
December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2019 and of terminal values for Windstream, plus the present value of the cash tax savings from
Windstream’s federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, estimated by Windstream management. Implied terminal values were
derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0% to 1.0%. Present values (as of October 31, 2016) of cash flows and terminal
values were then calculated using discount rates of 7.3% to 8.5%, based on Windstream’s estimated weighted average cost of capital.
Present values of net operating loss carryforwards were calculated using Windstream’s estimated cost of equity of 12.5%. The discounted
cash flow analysis resulted in an implied per share present value range for Windstream common stock of approximately $0 to $18.04,
compared to the closing per share price of Windstream common stock on November 3, 2016 of $6.78.

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

Foros noted that, due to the high variability in the implied per share present values of Windstream common stock resulting from minimal
differences in terminal year assumptions, among other factors, a DCF analysis of Windstream was of limited utility. As a result, Foros did
not rely upon a DCF analysis of Windstream in its fairness determination and did not calculate a range of implied exchange ratios based on
its DCF analyses of EarthLink and Windstream.

Contribution Analysis

Foros reviewed the relative contributions and implied exchange ratios of the market capitalization of EarthLink and Windstream, estimated
Adjusted EBITDA of EarthLink and Adjusted EBITDAR of Windstream, estimated UFCF of EarthLink and UFCF of Windstream, and
normalized leveraged free cash flows, or Normalized LFCF, defined as UFCF less interest and taxes for EarthLink and UFCF less interest
and taxes for Windstream, in each case for EarthLink and Windstream on a stand-alone basis for calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019,
relative to the exchange ratio of 0.818. Financial data for EarthLink and Windstream were based on the EarthLink Projections and the
Windstream Projections as adjusted by EarthLink, respectively. Based on the implied relative equity value contributions, Foros calculated
the following implied exchange ratios, in each case compared to the exchange ratio of 0.818:

 Contribution Percentage Implied Exchange
Financial Metric EarthLink Windstream Ratio
Market Capitalization 48% 52% 0.799
Adjusted EBITDA/
Adjusted EBITDAR    
       2017 56% 44% 1.076
       2018 58% 42% 1.202
       2019 60% 40% 1.307
UFCF    
       2017 53% 47% 0.967
       2018 53% 47% 0.973
       2019 52% 48% 0.945
Normalized LFCF    
       2017 44% 56% 0.678
       2018 42% 58% 0.613
       2019 38% 62% 0.519

Comparison of EarthLink Estimated Standalone Value to Share of Pro Forma Value

DCF-Based Analysis

Foros reviewed and compared the implied per share values of EarthLink common stock on a stand-alone basis using the DCF analysis
summarized above with the implied per share values of the combined company using a DCF analysis. For the DCF analysis of the
combined company, Foros calculated the net present value of the unlevered, after-tax, free cash flows for the combined company based on
the standalone unlevered, after-tax, free cash flows for each of EarthLink and Windstream, derived as described above, including
estimated synergies based on assumptions provided by EarthLink management, to be generated during the three fiscal quarters ending
December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019, and implied terminal values derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from
0.0% to 1.0%, based on the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR-weighted average of EarthLink’s and Windstream’s estimated
perpetuity growth rates. The present values (as of March 31, 2017) of the cash flows and the terminal values were then calculated using a
range of discount rates of 7.5% to 8.5%, based on the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR-weighted average of EarthLink’s and
Windstream’s estimated weighted average cost of capital, respectively, and the resulting implied equity values were then discounted

to present value (as of October 31, 2016) using the combined company's estimated cost of equity of 12.5%. Foros also calculated the
present value of the combined company’s estimated net operating loss carry forwards discounted to October 31, 2016 using the combined
company’s estimated cost of equity of 12.5%. The results of this analysis are summarized below:

Implied Equity Value of EarthLink Common Implied EarthLink Per Share Value of
Stock on a Stand-Alone Basis Combined Company’s Common Stock

$5.18 - $8.30 $2.98 - $15.60

Present Value of Future Share Price-Based Analysis

Foros reviewed the implied per share values of EarthLink common stock on a stand-alone basis using a present value of future share price
analysis described above, applying multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.0x to EarthLink’s estimated NTM Adjusted EBITDA as of December
31, 2018, and discounting the resulting share price and dividends to be paid on the EarthLink common stock through December 31, 2018
based on EarthLink’s current dividend policy to October 31, 2016 using a range of discount rates of 10.5% to 12.5%, which rates were
selected based on EarthLink’s estimated cost of equity. Foros also reviewed the implied per share value of the combined company’s
common stock using a present value of future share price analysis for the combined company’s estimated future share price as of
December 31, 2018. For the present value of future stock price analysis of the combined company, Foros applied multiples ranging from
5.25x to 5.75x to the combined company’s estimated NTM Adjusted EBITDAR as of December 31, 2018 based on the EarthLink
Projections and the Windstream Projections as adjusted by EarthLink, including estimated synergies based on assumptions provided by
EarthLink management. Foros then discounted the share price and dividends to be paid on the combined company’s common stock
through December 31, 2018 based on the combined company’s anticipated dividend policy to October 31, 2016 using a range of discount
rates of 11.5% to 13.5%, which rates were selected based on the combined company’s estimated cost of equity. The results of this analysis
are summarized below:

Implied Equity Value of EarthLink Implied EarthLink Per Share Value of
Common Stock and Cash Dividends on a Combined Company’s Common Stock and

Stand-Alone Basis Cash Dividends

General

Foros is a financial services firm that provides mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance advisory and capital raising services.
EarthLink selected Foros to act as EarthLink’s financial advisor in connection with the mergers because of Foros’s substantial experience
in transactions similar to the mergers, Foros’s reputation in the investment community and Foros’s familiarity with EarthLink and its
business.

In connection with the review of the mergers by the EarthLink Board, Foros performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations
as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to particular circumstances and,
therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of
the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Foros’s opinion. Foros did not form an opinion or recommendation as to whether any individual analysis or factor, considered in isolation,
supported or failed to support its opinion. Foros considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to
any factor or analysis it considered. Rather, Foros made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 96/364

Foros prepared its analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the EarthLink Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the exchange ratio. Foros’s analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by Foros’s analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Foros, EarthLink, Windstream or their respective affiliates or
any other person, assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the mergers was determined through arms’ length negotiations between EarthLink and
Windstream and was approved by the EarthLink Board. Foros provided advice to the EarthLink Board during these negotiations. Foros did
not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to EarthLink or the EarthLink Board or that any specific amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the mergers.

Foros acted as lead financial advisor to EarthLink in connection with the mergers and pursuant to the terms of EarthLink’s engagement
letter with Foros, EarthLink (i) has paid Foros retainer fees and (ii) has agreed to pay an opinion fee of $2 million payable upon Foros
rendering its opinion (or advising EarthLink that Foros would be unable to deliver an opinion after conducting the relevant analyses at the
request of EarthLink), and a transaction fee estimated as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be approximately $13.5
million (against which the opinion fee and a portion of the retainer fees will be credited), which transaction fee is contingent upon the
completion of the mergers. In addition, EarthLink has agreed to reimburse Foros’s expenses and indemnify Foros against certain liabilities
arising out of its engagement.

Foros and its affiliates in the past have provided investment banking and other financial services to EarthLink for which Foros has
received compensation during the two year period prior to the date of Foros’s opinion in the amount of approximately $1.25 million, and
in the future may provide investment banking and other financial services to EarthLink and Windstream for which Foros may receive
compensation. During the two year period prior to the date of Foros’s opinion, Foros did not provide investment banking or other financial
services to Windstream.

The decision to recommend and enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the EarthLink Board. As described above in the section
titled “—EarthLink’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of EarthLink’s Board of Directors,” Foros’s opinion and analyses were
only one of many factors considered by the EarthLink Board in its evaluation of the mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of
the views of the EarthLink Board with respect to the mergers. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by Foros in connection with its opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Foros
attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the EarthLink Board that, as of November 5, 2016 and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Windstream and its affiliates) of EarthLink common stock.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated November 5, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C.
Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the EarthLink Board in connection with its
consideration of the mergers. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of EarthLink’s common
stock should vote with respect to the mergers, or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among
other things:

● the merger agreement; 
 

● annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10 K of EarthLink and Windstream for the five fiscal years ended
December 31, 2015; 
 

● certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of EarthLink and Windstream;
 

● certain publicly available research analyst reports for EarthLink and Windstream; 
 

● certain other communications from EarthLink and Windstream to their respective stockholders; 
 

● certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Windstream prepared by its management, which forecasts are summarized
below in the section entitled “—Certain Prospective Financial Information of Windstream,” beginning on page 108;
 

● certain financial analyses and forecasts for Windstream prepared by the management of EarthLink, certain internal financial
analyses and forecasts for EarthLink prepared by its management, which forecasts are summarized below in the section entitled
"—Certain Prospective Financial Information of EarthLink," beginning on page 91, and certain financial analyses and forecasts for
Windstream pro forma for the mergers prepared by the management of EarthLink, in each case, as approved for Goldman Sachs'
use by EarthLink (which we refer to collectively in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Forecasts), including
certain operating synergies projected by the management of EarthLink to result from the mergers, as approved for Goldman Sachs'
use by EarthLink (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Synergies); and
 

● certain net operating loss utilization forecasts for EarthLink and Windstream prepared by the management of EarthLink and certain
net operating loss utilization forecasts for Windstream pro forma for the mergers prepared by the management of EarthLink, in
each case, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by EarthLink (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the NOL Forecasts).

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of EarthLink and Windstream regarding their assessment
of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the mergers and the past and current business operations, financial condition,
and future prospects of EarthLink and Windstream; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of EarthLink common
stock and the shares of Windstream common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for EarthLink and
Windstream with similar financial and stock market information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded;
reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other
factors, as it deemed appropriate.

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with EarthLink’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it,
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with EarthLink’s consent
that the Forecasts, including the Synergies, and the NOL Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of EarthLink. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal
of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of EarthLink or
Windstream or any of their respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed
that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the mergers will be obtained without
any adverse effect on EarthLink or Windstream or on the expected benefits of the mergers in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman
Sachs has also assumed that the mergers will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of EarthLink to engage in the mergers or the relative merits of
the mergers as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to EarthLink; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an
acquisition of, or other business combination with, EarthLink or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only
the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Windstream and its affiliates) of EarthLink common stock, as of the
date of the opinion, of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and
does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the mergers or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the mergers, including, the fairness of the
mergers to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of EarthLink; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,
directors or employees of EarthLink or Windstream, or class of such persons in connection with the mergers, whether relative to the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary,
market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs
assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after
the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Windstream common
stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the mergers on the solvency or viability of EarthLink or Windstream or the ability of
EarthLink or Windstream to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness
committee of Goldman Sachs.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the EarthLink Board in connection with
rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables
must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it
existed on or before November 4, 2016, the last trading day before the public announcement of the mergers, and is not necessarily
indicative of current market conditions.

Following Goldman Sachs’ presentation to the EarthLink Board on November 5, 2016 (which we refer to in this section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the November 5 Presentation), Goldman Sachs determined that the estimates of unlevered free cash flows for
EarthLink and Windstream for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 used in the illustrative discounted cash flow analyses did not reflect
the Forecasts and that the estimates of dividends used in the pro forma combined company illustrative present value of future stock price
analysis and the range of implied terminal EBITDA multiples referenced in the illustrative discounted cash flow analyses were calculated
incorrectly. Goldman Sachs subsequently performed such analyses, as of November 5, 2016, using the corrected estimates and calculations
(as corrected, collectively referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Corrected Estimates and Calculations).
Such subsequent analyses performed by Goldman Sachs do not address any circumstances, developments or events occurring after
November 5, 2016, which is the date of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, and Goldman Sachs’ opinion set forth in its written opinion
letter was provided only as of such date. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, Goldman Sachs confirmed to the EarthLink Board that,
had Goldman Sachs performed its financial analyses set forth in the presentation on November 5, 2016 using the Corrected Estimates and
Calculations, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in the written opinion of Goldman Sachs.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis and Exchange Ratio Analysis

Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices for the shares of EarthLink common stock for the 3-month and 52-week periods
ended on November 4, 2016. Goldman Sachs calculated the premium (or discount) implied by the implied value per share of EarthLink
common stock in the merger of $5.92 (which implied value per share of EarthLink common stock was obtained by multiplying the
exchange ratio by the closing price of shares of Windstream common stock on November 4, 2016) and (1) the closing price per share of
EarthLink common stock on November 4, 2016; (2) the undisturbed closing price per share of EarthLink common stock on November 3,
2016, the last unaffected trading day before rumors about a possible transaction between EarthLink and Windstream were published by
Reuters; (3) the volume-weighted average price, or “VWAP”, per share of EarthLink common stock during the three-month period ended
on November 4, 2016; (4) the highest closing price per share of EarthLink common stock for the 52-week period ended on November 4,
2016; and (5) the lowest closing price per share of EarthLink common stock for the 52-week period ended on November 4, 2016. This
analysis showed the following implied premia (or discounts):

Share Price
Historical Date or Period Share price Premia/(Discount)
November 4, 2016 (Closing Price on Last
       Trading Day Prior to Announcement) $6.22 (4.8)%
November 3, 2016 (Undisturbed Share Price) $5.42 9.3%
3 month VWAP $6.27 (5.5)%
52 Week high $9.86 (39.9)%
52 week low $4.97 19.2%

Goldman Sachs also calculated (i) an implied exchange ratio on November 3 and 4, 2016, by dividing the closing price per share of
EarthLink common stock on each such trading day by the closing price per share of Windstream common stock on the same trading day,
and (ii) the historical average exchange ratios over the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year periods ended on November 4, 2016, by
first dividing the closing price per share of EarthLink common stock on each trading day during such period by the closing price per share
of Windstream common stock on the same trading day and subsequently

taking the average of these daily historical exchange ratios over such periods. Goldman Sachs then calculated the premia (or discounts)
implied by the exchange ratio to the historical average exchange ratio over the various periods. The following table presents the results of
this analysis:

Premium
EarthLink/Windstream (Discount) vs.

Historical Date or Period Implied Exchange Ratio Exchange Ratio

Illustrative Present Value of Future Stock Price Analysis

Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value, as of September 30, 2016, of the future stock price of
EarthLink, Windstream and the pro forma combined company, respectively, which analysis is designed to provide an indication of the
present value of a theoretical future value of the equity of EarthLink, Windstream and the pro forma combined company, as a function of
EarthLink’s, Windstream’s and the pro forma combined company’s respective Adjusted EBITDA, as reflected in the Forecasts (which, in
the case of the pro forma combined company, included the Synergies) and one-year forward enterprise value (which we refer to in this
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EV)/Adjusted EBITDA multiples, for the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2017 and
2018.

For shares of EarthLink common stock, Goldman Sachs calculated the illustrative implied future stock price by (i) calculating the
illustrative implied enterprise value for the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, by applying multiples
ranging from 4.5x to 5.5x to the one-year forward estimated Adjusted EBITDA as of such dates, as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii)
deriving illustrative implied future equity values by subtracting from the illustrative implied enterprise values the respective amounts of
EarthLink’s net debt as of such dates, as reflected in the Forecasts. The illustrative implied future per share values for EarthLink were then
calculated by dividing the illustrative implied future equity values by the total number of fully diluted shares of EarthLink outstanding as
of December 31, 2018, as provided by the management of EarthLink. Goldman Sachs then added to the implied future per share values an
aggregate amount of estimated per share dividends to be paid by EarthLink through December 31, 2017 or 2018, as applicable, as reflected
in the Forecasts. These illustrative implied future per share values were then discounted to September 30, 2016, using a discount rate of
9.8%, reflecting an estimate of EarthLink’s cost of equity. This analysis yielded an illustrative range of implied present values per share of
(i) $4.93 to $6.60 using the estimated 2017 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2018 Adjusted EBITDA and
(ii) $5.15 to $6.68 using the estimated 2018 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.
Goldman Sachs then compared the implied value per share of EarthLink common stock in the merger of $5.92 to the illustrative range of
implied present values per share of EarthLink common stock derived from such analyses using the estimated 2018 one-year forward
EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.

For shares of Windstream common stock, Goldman Sachs calculated the illustrative implied future stock price by (i) calculating the
illustrative implied enterprise value for the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, by applying multiples
ranging from 4.0x to 5.0x to the one-year forward estimated Adjusted EBITDA as of such dates, as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii)
deriving illustrative implied future equity values by subtracting from the respective amounts of Windstream’s net debt as of such dates, as
reflected in the Forecasts. The implied future per share values for Windstream were then calculated by dividing the illustrative implied
future equity values by the total number of fully diluted shares of Windstream outstanding as of December 31, 2018, as provided by the
management of Windstream. Goldman Sachs then added to the implied future per share values an aggregate amount of estimated per share
dividends to be paid by Windstream through December 31, 2017 or 2018, as applicable, as reflected in the Forecasts. These illustrative
implied future per share values were then discounted to September 30, 2016, using a discount rate of 14.1%, reflecting an estimate of
Windstream’s cost of equity. This analysis yielded an illustrative range of implied present values per share of (i) $0.97 to $12.08 using the
estimated 2017 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2018 Adjusted EBITDA and (ii) $1.92 to $11.37 using
the estimated 2018 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.

For shares of the pro forma combined company, Goldman Sachs calculated the illustrative implied future stock price by (i) calculating the
illustrative implied enterprise value for the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, by applying multiples
ranging from 4.0x to 5.0x to the one-year forward estimated Adjusted EBITDA as of such dates, as reflected in the Forecasts and after
giving effect to the Synergies and (ii) deriving illustrative implied future equity values by subtracting the respective amounts of the pro
forma combined company’s net debt as of such dates, as reflected in the Forecasts. The implied future per share values were then
calculated by dividing the illustrative implied future equity values by the total number of fully diluted shares of the pro forma combined
company outstanding as of December 31, 2018, as provided by the management of EarthLink. Goldman Sachs then added to the
illustrative implied per share values an aggregate amount of estimated per share dividends to be paid by the pro forma combined company
through December 31, 2017 or 2018, as applicable, as reflected in the Forecasts. These illustrative implied future per share values were
then discounted to September 30, 2016, using a discount rate of 12%, reflecting an estimate of the pro forma combined company’s cost of
equity. As set forth in the November 5 Presentation, this analysis yielded an illustrative range of implied present values per share of (i)
$4.12 to $11.42 using the estimated 2017 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2018 Adjusted EBITDA and
(ii) $5.64 to $12.28 using the estimated 2018 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.
Using the Corrected Estimates and Calculations, this analysis yielded an illustrative range of implied present values per share of (i) $4.40
to $11.70 using the estimated 2017 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2018 Adjusted EBITDA and (ii)
$5.89 to $12.53 using the estimated 2018 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.

Goldman Sachs then calculated an illustrative range of implied present values per share of EarthLink’s share, taking into account the
exchange ratio, of the pro forma combined company using the illustrative EarthLink and pro forma combined company present value of
future stock price analyses described above. These illustrative implied future per share values were then discounted to September 30,
2016, using discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%, reflecting estimates of the pro forma combined company’s cost of equity. As set
forth in the November 5 Presentation, this analysis yielded an illustrative range of $4.46 to $10.26 using the estimated 2018 one-year
forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA. Using the Corrected Estimates and Calculations, this
analysis yielded an illustrative range of $4.65 to $10.47 using the estimated 2018 one-year forward EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples and
estimated 2019 Adjusted EBITDA.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of EarthLink, Windstream and the pro forma combined company,
in each case using the Forecasts (which, in the case of the pro forma combined company, included the Synergies). In the illustrative
discounted cash flow analyses described in this section, unlevered free cash flows, which is projected Adjusted EBITDA, minus taxes
(calculated by multiplying the tax rate contained in the Forecasts by projected earnings before interest and taxes), minus projected capital
expenditures and minus the projected increase in net working capital, was calculated using the Forecasts. In addition, stock based
compensation was treated as a cash expense for purposes of determining unlevered free cash flows.

For the discounted cash flow analysis of EarthLink, Goldman Sachs first calculated a range of illustrative implied enterprise values for
EarthLink by discounting to present value, as of September 30, 2016, using discount rates ranging from 7.50% to 9.00%, reflecting
estimates of EarthLink’s weighted average cost of capital, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows for EarthLink for the period from
September 30, 2016 through December 31, 2019, as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for EarthLink
derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 2.0% to a terminal year estimate of EarthLink’s projected unlevered free
cash flows, as reflected in the Forecasts, and which implied a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 3.3x to 5.5x (as set forth in the
Corrected Estimates and Calculations). Goldman Sachs then subtracted from such range of illustrative implied enterprise values the
amount of EarthLink’s reported net debt as of September 30, 2016 and added to such range of illustrative implied enterprise values the
estimated net present value of EarthLink’s net operating losses, as provided by the management of EarthLink, to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for EarthLink. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted
shares of EarthLink outstanding as of October 31, 2016, as provided by the management of EarthLink. As set forth in the November 5
Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of EarthLink common stock ranging from $4.24 to
$7.89, and using the Corrected Estimates and Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of
EarthLink common stock ranging from $4.17 to $7.81.

For the discounted cash flow analysis of Windstream, Goldman Sachs first calculated a range of illustrative implied enterprise values for
Windstream by discounting to present value, as of September 30, 2016, using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 8.75%, reflecting
estimates of Windstream’s weighted average cost of capital, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows for Windstream for the period from
September 30, 2016 through December 31, 2019, as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for
Windstream derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 2.0% to a terminal year estimate of Windstream’s projected
unlevered free cash flows, as reflected in the Forecasts, and which implied a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 3.4x to 7.2x (using
the Corrected Estimates and Calculations). Goldman Sachs then subtracted from such range of illustrative implied enterprise values the
amount of Windstream’s reported net debt as of September 30, 2016 and added to such range of illustrative implied enterprise values the
estimated net present value of Windstream’s net operating losses, as provided by the management of EarthLink, to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for Windstream. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully
diluted shares of EarthLink outstanding as of October 31, 2016, as provided by the management of Windstream. As set forth in the
November 5 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Windstream common stock ranging
from $0.00 to $32.03, and using the Corrected Estimates and Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per
share of Windstream common stock ranging from $0.00 to $32.02.

For the discounted cash flow analysis of the pro forma combined company, Goldman Sachs first calculated a range of illustrative implied
enterprise values for the pro forma combined company by discounting to present value, as of September 30, 2016, using discount rates
ranging from 7.75% to 8.75%, reflecting estimates of the pro forma combined company’s weighted average cost of capital, (i) estimates of
unlevered free cash flows for the pro forma combined company for the period from September 30, 2016 through December 31, 2019, as
reflected in the Forecasts and after giving effect to the Synergies and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the pro forma combined
company derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 2.0% to a terminal year estimate of the pro forma combined
company’s projected unlevered free cash flows, as reflected in the Forecasts and after giving effect to the Synergies. Goldman Sachs then
subtracted from such range of illustrative implied enterprise values the amount of the pro forma combined company’s implied net debt as
of September 30, 2016, as provided by the management of EarthLink, and added the estimated net present value of the pro forma
combined company’s net operating losses, as provided by the management of EarthLink, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for
the pro forma combined company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values by the number of fully diluted shares
of the pro forma combined company outstanding as of October 31, 2016, as provided by the management of EarthLink. As set forth in the
November 5 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values of EarthLink’s share, taking into account the
exchange ratio, of the pro forma combined company ranging from $0.77 to $21.69, and using the Corrected Estimates and Calculations,
this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of EarthLink’s share, taking into account the exchange ratio, of the
pro forma combined company ranging from $0.72 to $21.64.

Illustrative Financial Contribution Analysis

Goldman Sachs analyzed the implied equity contributions of EarthLink and Windstream to the pro forma combined company, based on
specific estimated future financial metrics including revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, dividend yield and levered free cash flows (which we
refer to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as LFCF) for the next twelve months and for estimated fiscal years ending
on December 31, 2017 and 2018, as reflected in the Forecasts and using market data as of November 3, 2016. The analysis was conducted
on a pro forma basis by applying (i) a blended multiple to EarthLink’s and Windstream’s respective revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
metrics to arrive at an illustrative implied enterprise value as of the end of the next twelve months and December 31, 2017 and 2018 for
each of EarthLink and Windstream and subtracting EarthLink’s and Windstream’s respective amounts of net debt as of such dates, as
reflected in the Forecasts, to calculate an implied equity value for each of EarthLink and Windstream and (ii) a blended estimated yield to
EarthLink’s and Windstream’s respective dividend and LFCF metrics to arrive at an implied equity value for each of EarthLink and
Windstream.

The analysis resulted in the following implied equity contribution of EarthLink and Windstream, respectively, to the pro forma combined
company and the implied exchange ratio for a share of EarthLink common stock into Windstream common stock, in each case, using each
financial metric for EarthLink and Windstream for the next twelve months ended November 2017 and the estimated fiscal years ending on
December 31, 2017 and 2018:

Premia Analysis

Using information obtained from Thomson Reuters, Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed the acquisition premia for certain publicly
disclosed all-stock mergers since 2006 with a transaction value of less than $5 billion, excluding any transaction involving a financial
sponsor and transactions where the acquirer’s market capitalization was more than 90% larger than the target’s market capitalization at the
time of the transaction, calculated relative to the target’s closing share price (i) one day prior to announcement, (ii) one week prior to
announcement and (iii) four weeks prior to announcement. Using such data, Goldman Sachs calculated the first and third quartile
acquisition premia for these selected transactions as 5.4% and 28.0%, respectively, for the one day premia, 5.3% and 31.2%, respectively,
for the one week premia and 12.8% and 37.0%, respectively, for the four week premia. Based on these calculations, Goldman Sachs
applied the first and third quartile one day premia to the undisturbed closing share price of EarthLink common stock on November 3, 2016
to derive illustrative implied prices per share of EarthLink common stock of $5.71 to $6.94.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered
the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman
Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of
its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to EarthLink or Windstream or
the contemplated merger.

Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the EarthLink Board as to the fairness
from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Windstream and its affiliates) of EarthLink common stock, as of the date of the
opinion, of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily
indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these
analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors, none of EarthLink, Windstream, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast.

The exchange ratio was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between EarthLink and Windstream and was approved by the
EarthLink Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to EarthLink during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend
any specific exchange ratio to EarthLink or its board of directors or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate
exchange ratio for the merger.

As described below, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the EarthLink Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the EarthLink
Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.

Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and
its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities in which they invest or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell,
hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and
other financial instruments of EarthLink, Windstream, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any currency or commodity that
may be involved in the mergers contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to EarthLink in
connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the mergers contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman
Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Windstream and/or its affiliates from time to time for
which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a joint bookrunner with
respect to the transfer by Windstream of 14,703,993 shares of common stock of Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc., a former
subsidiary of Windstream, in exchange for outstanding loans (aggregate principal amount $309,000,000) under Windstream’s revolving
credit facility in April 2015. During the two-year period ended November 5, 2016, Goldman Sachs has received compensation for
financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Windstream and/or its affiliates of
approximately $1,158,273. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide investment banking services to EarthLink, Windstream and their
respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation. During the two-year period
ended November 5, 2016, Goldman Sachs has not received any fees for investment banking or other financial services from EarthLink.

The EarthLink Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the mergers. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated October 24, 2016, EarthLink
engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated mergers. The engagement letter between
EarthLink and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of $3,500,000, all of which is payable upon consummation of the mergers. In
addition, EarthLink has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and
to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Certain Prospective Financial Information of EarthLink

EarthLink does not as a matter of course make public long-term forecasts as to future performance or other prospective financial
information beyond the current fiscal year, and EarthLink is especially wary of making forecasts or projections for extended periods due to
the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, as part of the due diligence review of EarthLink in connection
with the mergers, EarthLink’s management prepared and provided to Windstream, as well as to Foros and Goldman Sachs in connection
with their respective evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration, the EarthLink Projections, which include certain non-public,
internal financial forecasts regarding EarthLink’s projected future operations for the 2016 through 2019 fiscal years.

EarthLink has included below a summary of the EarthLink Projections for the purpose of providing stockholders and investors access to
certain non-public information that was furnished to EarthLink’s financial advisers, and such information may not be appropriate for other
purposes. The EarthLink Projections were also considered by the EarthLink Board for purposes of evaluating the mergers. Windstream
was also provided with a set of financial forecasts of EarthLink for purposes of its due diligence that were nearly identical to the EarthLink
Projections, the differences of which included approximately $1 million less for estimated Capital Expenditures for 2016, resulting in a
corresponding difference of approximately $2 million more, when rounded, for estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flows for 2016 (which are
also referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, where applicable, as the EarthLink Projections). The EarthLink Board also
considered non-public, financial forecasts prepared by Windstream regarding Windstream’s anticipated future operations for the 2016
through 2019 fiscal years for purposes of evaluating Windstream and the mergers. See the section entitled “—Certain Prospective
Financial Information of Windstream” beginning on page 108 for more information about the forecasts prepared by Windstream.

The EarthLink Projections, which are summarized below, were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared
with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. Ernst & Young LLP has not examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective
financial information and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The Ernst & Young LLP reports incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus relate to EarthLink’s historical
financial information. They do not extend to the EarthLink Projections and should not be read to do so. The summary of the EarthLink
Projections included below is not being included to influence your decision whether to vote for the mergers and the transactions
contemplated in connection with the mergers, but because such EarthLink Projections were provided by EarthLink to Foros and Goldman
Sachs.

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

While presented with numeric specificity, the EarthLink Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but
not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
additional matters specific to EarthLink’s businesses) that are inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of
EarthLink’s management. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the EarthLink Projections to not be achieved include,
but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to EarthLink’s business (including its ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives
and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the
“Risk Factors” section of EarthLink’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, all of
which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The EarthLink Projections also
reflect numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the EarthLink Projections. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the forecasted results summarized below will be realized.

The inclusion of a summary of the EarthLink Projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication
that any of EarthLink, Windstream or their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the EarthLink Projections to be
predictive of actual future events, and the EarthLink Projections should not be relied upon as such nor should the information contained in
the EarthLink Projections be considered appropriate for other purposes. None of EarthLink, Windstream or their respective affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the EarthLink
Projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the EarthLink Projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the EarthLink Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the
event that any or all of the assumptions underlying these forecasts are shown to be in error. Since the forecasts cover multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less meaningful and predictive with each successive year. EarthLink does not intend to make publicly
available any update or other revision to the EarthLink Projections summarized below. None of EarthLink or its affiliates, advisors,
officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any stockholder or other person regarding EarthLink’s
ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the EarthLink Projections summarized below, or that the forecasted results
will be achieved. EarthLink has made no representation to Windstream, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the EarthLink
Projections. The EarthLink Projections summarized below do not give effect to the mergers. EarthLink urges all stockholders to review
EarthLink’s reported financial results in its most recent SEC filings.

that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in its business, as they exclude the effect of non-operational items,
such as restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs, gain on sale of business and loss on extinguishment of debt and non-
cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. EarthLink management believes that
excluding the effects of certain non-operational and non-cash items enables investors to better understand and analyze the current
period’s results and provides a better measure of comparability. EarthLink management also believes that these non-GAAP
financial measures enable investors to evaluate EarthLink’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as
management. These non-GAAP financial measures may also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to
those of peer companies.

There are limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Adjusted
EBITDA Margin are not indicative of cash provided or used by operating activities and may differ from comparable information
provided by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be
considered in isolation, as an alternative to, or more meaningful than measures of financial performance determined in accordance
with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and other, net, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, restructuring, acquisition and
integration-related costs, gain on sale of businesses and loss on extinguishment of debt. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as
Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. EarthLink management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of
EarthLink’s business and for strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in incentive compensation
arrangements and is a factor in calculating debt covenants.

Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and other, net, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, restructuring, acquisition and
integration-related costs, gain on sale of businesses and loss on extinguishment of debt, less cash used for purchases of property and
equipment. Unlevered Free Cash Flow is used by EarthLink management to evaluate the performance of EarthLink’s business and
to assess its ability to fund capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service and repay debt and pay dividends.

EarthLink does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict with
reasonable certainty future changes in interest rates, changes in the company’s effective income tax rates or the future impact of
unusual gains and losses, restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs and purchase accounting fair value adjustments
without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to EarthLink’s results
computed in accordance with GAAP.

Windstream’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of Windstream’s Board of Directors

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and recommend approval of the Windstream stock issuance and the adoption of
the Windstream charter amendment, the Windstream Board consulted with Windstream’s management, as well as with Windstream’s legal
and financial advisors, and also considered a number of factors that it viewed as supporting its decisions, including, but not limited to, the
following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

● the mergers will create a stronger, more competitive national telecommunications provider with a nationwide network of
approximately 145,000 fiber route miles;

93



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

● the expectation that the mergers will expand Windstream’s fiber network with strategic routes to increase wholesale transport
opportunities and on-net traffic and meaningfully reduce access costs for the combined company; 
 

● the combined company will have greater potential to create value for stockholders than Windstream would otherwise have on a
stand-alone basis, with a significant increase in scale and potential to achieve meaningful synergies through, among other factors,
the consolidation of corporate overhead and duplicate functions;
 

● the expectation that the transaction will be significantly accretive to Windstream’s adjusted free cash flow per share, allowing
greater financial flexibility for strategic network investments and debt reduction and providing support for the continued
payment of Windstream’s existing dividend after closing of the transaction;
 

● the expectation that the mergers likely will create greater than $125 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies
expected to be realizable within three years of closing;
 

● the expectation that the mergers will reduce pro forma gross leverage for the combined company after taking into account all
anticipated synergies;
 

● the fact that EarthLink’s fiber footprint is highly complementary with Windstream’s fiber footprint, especially in the
Southeastern United States, and would expand Windstream’s current network by 29,000 fiber route miles of 
which 16,000 miles will be unique fiber routes not currently serviced by Windstream;
 

● the expectation that the similar operating structures and goals of the two companies will drive advancement of products and
services, including SD WAN and UCaaS, allowing the combined company to be a stronger competitor in a market dominated
by larger telecommunication providers;
 

● the expectation that the combined company will benefit from utilization of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective
accumulated net operating losses after the closing;
 

● its knowledge of Windstream’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects and its knowledge of
EarthLink’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking into account the results of Windstream’s
thorough due diligence review of EarthLink conducted by its management team, key personnel and its advisors;
 

● the fact that nine members of the proposed twelve-member combined company board will be members of the existing
Windstream Board and that Mr. Thomas will be the chief executive officer and Mr. Gunderman will be the chief financial
officer of the combined company;
 

● the current and prospective business climate in the industry in which Windstream and EarthLink operate;
 

● the projected financial results of Windstream and EarthLink as standalone companies and the fit of the transaction with
Windstream’s strategic goals;
 

● the financial analysis presentation of Barclays and the oral opinion of Barclays rendered to the Windstream Board on November
5, 2016 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of November 5, 2016, and based upon and subject
to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the exchange ratio to be paid by Windstream was fair to
Windstream from a financial point of view as more fully described in the section entitled “—Opinion of Windstream’s Financial
Advisor” beginning on page 97;

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 110/364

● the historical stock prices of Windstream and EarthLink, including the fact that the implied value of the exchange ratio of 0.818
shares of Windstream common stock per share of EarthLink common stock represents a 13% premium to the average exchange
ratio of 0.721 over the 30-day period ended November 3, 2016 (the last unaffected trading day before rumors about a possible
transaction between EarthLink and Windstream were published by Reuters);
 

● the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the strong commitments by both Windstream and EarthLink to
complete the mergers;
 

● the fact that the merger agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio and that no adjustment will be made in the merger
consideration to be received by EarthLink stockholders in the merger as a result of possible increases or decreases in the trading
price of Windstream’s common stock following the announcement of the merger; and
 

● the fact that existing Windstream stockholders are expected to own approximately 51% of the combined company immediately
after completion of the mergers and will have the opportunity to participate in the future performance of the combined
company;

The Windstream Board weighed the foregoing against a number of potentially negative factors, including:

● the risk that anticipated benefits of the mergers, including anticipated synergies, may not be realized as a result of difficulties
integrating the two companies;
 

● the risk that, despite the combined efforts of Windstream and EarthLink prior to the consummation of the mergers, the
combined company may lose key personnel;
 

● the risk that the terms of the merger agreement, including provisions relating to the payment of a termination fee under specified
circumstances, could have the effect of discouraging other parties that would be interested in a transaction solely with
Windstream from proposing such a transaction;
 

● the risk that if EarthLink terminates the merger agreement because Windstream is unable to obtain sufficient financing to
consummate the transactions pursuant to the merger agreement, then Windstream may be obligated to pay a termination fee of
$70 million;
 

● the risks that anticipated revenues of the combined company will not be obtained due to exposure to EarthLink’s large small
business customer base, which is a very competitive segment of the market in which Windstream and EarthLink operate;
 

● the risks that the combined company might incur higher costs than anticipated given that the majority of EarthLink’s customers
are off-net, which entail higher average access costs per customer than the majority of Windstream’s customers;
 

● the risk that credit rating agencies might downgrade Windstream’s ratings or might place Windstream’s credit ratings under
review for downgrade as a result of the mergers;
 

● the risk that changes in the regulatory landscape may adversely affect the business benefits anticipated to result from the
mergers;
 

● EarthLink’s right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate with respect to certain alternative takeover proposals
made prior to the time EarthLink stockholders adopt the merger agreement;

95



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 111/364

● the restrictions in the merger agreement on the conduct of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective businesses during the
period between execution of the merger agreement and completion of the mergers;
 

● the risk that Windstream or EarthLink stockholders may object to and challenge the mergers and take actions that may prevent
or delay the completion of the mergers, including to vote down the applicable proposals at the Windstream or EarthLink special
meetings;
 

● the risk that applicable regulators may object to and challenge the mergers and take actions that may prevent, delay or condition
the completion of the mergers;
 

● the risk that the pendency of the mergers for an extended period of time following the announcement of the mergers could have
an adverse impact on Windstream or the combined company;
 

● the potential for diversion of management and employee attention during the period prior to completion of the mergers, and the
potential negative effects on Windstream’s and the combined company’s businesses; and
 

● the risks of the type and nature described under the heading “Risk Factors” beginning on page 36 and the matters described
under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 34.

The Windstream Board considered all of these factors as a whole, and, on balance, concluded that they supported a determination to (1)
approve the merger agreement, (2) approve the mergers upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, (3)
approve the issuance by Windstream of 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock per share of EarthLink common stock pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and (4) approve (subject to Windstream stockholder approval) the
adoption of the Windstream charter amendment. The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Windstream Board is not
intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the principal factors considered by the Windstream Board. In light of the number and wide
variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the complexity of these factors, the Windstream Board
did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors that
it considered in reaching its decision. In considering these factors, individual members of the Windstream Board may have given differing
weights to different factors. The Windstream Board conducted an overall review of the factors described above, including thorough
discussions with Windstream’s management and legal and financial advisors. In considering the recommendation of the Windstream Board
to approve the share issuance proposal, Windstream stockholders should be aware that Windstream’s directors may have interests in the
mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those of Windstream stockholders generally. For additional information, see the section
entitled “—Interests of Windstream Directors and Officers in the Mergers” beginning on page 110.

The factors contained in this explanation of the reasoning of the Windstream Board and certain information presented in this section are
forward-looking in nature. Therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 34.

The Windstream Board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Windstream stock issuance and the Windstream charter amendment, and has determined and declared that they are advisable
and are in the best interests of Windstream and its stockholders. The Windstream Board unanimously recommends that the
Windstream stockholders vote “FOR” the Windstream stock issuance proposal, “FOR” the Windstream charter amendment
proposal and “FOR” the Windstream adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Windstream’s Financial Advisor

Windstream engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to a possible transaction with EarthLink, as confirmed in an
engagement letter dated November 1, 2016. On November 5, 2016, Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed
in writing) to the Windstream Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions
stated in its opinion, the exchange ratio to be paid by Windstream was fair to Windstream, from a financial point of view.

The full text of Barclays’ written opinion, dated as of November 5, 2016, is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering
its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion and
the methodology that Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion.

Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the Windstream Board,
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be paid by Windstream and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of Windstream as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the mergers or any other matter.
The terms of the mergers were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Windstream and EarthLink and were unanimously
approved by the Windstream Board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to Windstream or that any specific
form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the mergers. Barclays was not requested to address, and its
opinion does not in any manner address, Windstream’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the mergers, the likelihood
of the consummation of the mergers, or the relative merits of the mergers as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in
which Windstream might engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the
fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the mergers, or any class
of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be offered to the stockholders of EarthLink in the mergers. No limitations were
imposed by the Windstream Board upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its
opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:

● reviewed and analyzed the merger agreement and the specific terms of the mergers;
 

● reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning Windstream and EarthLink that Barclays believed to be
relevant to its analysis, including Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30,
2016;
 

● reviewed and analyzed drafts of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2016;

● reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of
Windstream furnished to Barclays by Windstream, including the Windstream Projections;
 

● reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of EarthLink
furnished to Barclays by Windstream, including (i) the EarthLink Projections and (ii) financial projections of EarthLink
prepared by management of Windstream (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream
EarthLink Projections);
 

● reviewed and analyzed net operating loss projections of Windstream prepared by management of Windstream (which we refer
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream NOL Projections) and net operating loss projections of EarthLink
prepared by management of Windstream (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, together with the
Windstream NOL Projections, as the NOL Projections);
 

● reviewed and analyzed the trading histories of Windstream’s and EarthLink’s common stock for the last twelve months as of
November 3, 2016 (the last full trading day prior to news reports of a potential merger of Windstream and EarthLink) and a
comparison of those trading histories with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
 

● reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of Windstream and
EarthLink with each other and with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
 

● reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the financial terms of the mergers with the financial terms of certain other transactions
that Barclays deemed relevant;
 

● reviewed and analyzed the pro forma impact of the mergers on the future financial performance of the combined company,
including (i) certain financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Windstream
on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers furnished to Barclays by Windstream, including financial projections of
Windstream on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers prepared by management of Windstream (which we refer to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Pro Forma Projections) and (ii) cost savings and operating synergies expected by
the management of Windstream to result from the mergers (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
collectively, as the Expected Synergies);
 

● reviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance
and price targets of Windstream and EarthLink;
 

● reviewed and analyzed the relative contributions of Windstream and EarthLink to the future financial performance of the
combined company on a pro forma basis;
 

● had discussions with the management of Windstream concerning Windstream’s and EarthLink’s businesses, operations, assets,
financial conditions and prospects; and
 

● undertook such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by
Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and did not assume responsibility or liability for any independent
verification of such information). Barclays also relied upon the assurances of management of Windstream that they were not

98



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to
the Windstream Projections, upon the advice and at the instruction of Windstream, Barclays assumed that such projections had been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Windstream as to the
future financial performance of Windstream and that Windstream would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. With
respect to the EarthLink Projections, upon the advice and at the instruction of Windstream, Barclays assumed that such projections had
been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of EarthLink as to
the future financial performance of EarthLink. With respect to the Windstream EarthLink Projections, upon the advice and at the
instruction of Windstream, Barclays assumed that such projections had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of Windstream as to the future financial performance of EarthLink and that
EarthLink would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. With respect to the Pro Forma Projections, upon the advice
and at the instruction of Windstream, Barclays assumed that such projections had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Windstream as to the future financial performance of Windstream on a
pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers, that the pro forma adjustments to the Windstream Projections were appropriate and that the
pro forma combined company would perform substantially in accordance with such Pro Forma Projections. With respect to the NOL
Projections, upon the advice and at the instruction of Windstream, Barclays assumed that the amounts of the NOL Projections were
reasonable and that the net operating losses contained in the NOL Projections would be realized in accordance with such estimates.
Furthermore, upon the advice and at the instruction of Windstream, Barclays assumed that the amounts and timing of the Expected
Synergies were reasonable and that the Expected Synergies would be realized in accordance with such estimates. Barclays assumed no
responsibility for and it expressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving
at its opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of Windstream or EarthLink and did not make
or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Windstream or EarthLink. Barclays’ opinion necessarily is based upon
market, economic and other conditions as they exist on, and can be evaluated as of, November 5, 2016. Barclays assumed no responsibility
for updating or revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that might occur after the date of its opinion. Barclays expressed no
opinion as to the prices at which shares of EarthLink common stock would trade following the announcement of the mergers or shares of
Windstream common stock would trade following the announcement or consummation of the mergers.

Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and all the agreements related
thereto. Barclays also assumed, upon the advice and at the instruction of Windstream, that all material governmental, regulatory and third
party approvals, consents and releases for the mergers would be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the merger agreement and
that the mergers would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Barclays further assumed, at the direction of Windstream, that the
mergers would qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Barclays did not express any opinion as to
any tax or other consequences that might result from the mergers, nor did Barclays’ opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or
accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood Windstream had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified
professionals.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below. In
arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of Windstream common stock or EarthLink
common stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be paid by

99



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 115/364

Windstream in the proposed transaction on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is
a complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative
analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
summary description.

In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed
and considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a
whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the Windstream Board. Certain
financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. In performing its analyses, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Windstream or any
other parties to the mergers. None of Windstream, EarthLink, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Barclays or any other person assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth
below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the businesses do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the
businesses may actually be sold.

Selected Comparable Company Analysis

In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a range of relative implied
equity values per share of Windstream and of EarthLink by reference to those companies, which could then be used to calculate implied
exchange ratio ranges, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial and operating data relating to Windstream and EarthLink with
selected companies that Barclays, based on its experience in the telecommunications and network services industry, deemed comparable to
Windstream and EarthLink. The selected comparable companies with respect to Windstream and EarthLink were:

● CenturyLink, Inc. ● Frontier Communications Corporation
 

● Cincinnati Bell Inc. ● Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc.
 

● Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. ● Lumos Networks Corp.
 

● FairPoint Communications, Inc.

Barclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of Windstream and EarthLink and the selected comparable
companies. As part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed each company’s ratio of its enterprise
value (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EV) to its calendar year 2017 estimated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EBITDA). Also, as part of its selected
comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed each company’s ratio of its EV to its calendar year 2017 estimated
EBITDA less capital expenditures (which

100



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 116/364

we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Op. FCF). The EV of each company was obtained by adding its short and long-term
debt to the sum of the market value of its common equity, the value of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any
minority interest, and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents. All of the calculations for Windstream and EarthLink were performed
with, and based on, the Windstream Projections and the Windstream EarthLink Projections, respectively. All of the calculations for the
selected comparable companies were performed with, and based on, publicly available financial data and closing prices, as of November 4,
2016, the last trading date prior to the delivery of Barclays’ opinion. The results of this selected comparable company analysis are
summarized below:

EV/2017E EBITDA Multiple      EV/2017E Op. FCF(3)
High 8.2x  14.0x
Median(1) 5.2x 9.5x
Low 4.4x  7.6x
Windstream(2) 4.5x 14.4x
EarthLink(2) 5.5x  10.1x
____________________

(1)      Excludes Windstream and EarthLink
 
(2) Financial data as of November 3, 2016 (the last full trading day prior to news reports of a potential merger of Windstream and

EarthLink)
 
(3) Cincinnati Bell Inc. and Lumos Networks Corp. excluded from range due to outlier multiples that, in Barclays’ professional

judgment, were not meaningful.

Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more business or operating characteristics with
Windstream or EarthLink. However, because of the inherent differences between the business, operations and prospects of Windstream or
EarthLink and those of the selected comparable companies, Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely
solely on the quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made qualitative judgments
concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Windstream, EarthLink and the
selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the
results of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability
levels and degree of operational risk between Windstream, EarthLink and the companies included in the selected comparable company
analysis.

Windstream Standalone Valuation: Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of EV to calendar year 2017 estimated
EBITDA multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x for Windstream. Barclays applied this range to Windstream’s projected calendar year 2017 estimated
EBITDA, as set out in the Windstream Projections, to calculate a range of implied EVs of Windstream. After deriving implied EVs for
Windstream, Barclays derived implied equity values per share by subtracting Windstream’s net debt as of September 30, 2016 from the
implied EVs and dividing the result by the number of fully diluted shares of Windstream common stock calculated using information
provided to Barclays by Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of Windstream
common stock of $6.78 to $19.33 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream EBITDA Range).

Based upon its professional judgments discussed above, Barclays also selected a range of EV to calendar year 2017 estimated Op. FCF
multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x for Windstream. Barclays applied this range to Windstream’s projected calendar year 2017 estimated Op. FCF,
as set out in the Windstream Projections,

to calculate a range of implied EVs of Windstream. After deriving implied EVs for Windstream, Barclays derived implied equity values
per share by subtracting Windstream’s net debt as of September 30, 2016 from the implied EVs and dividing the result by the number of
fully diluted shares of Windstream common stock calculated using information provided to Barclays by Windstream management. These
calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of Windstream Common Stock of $0.00 to $5.13 (which we refer to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream Op. FCF Range). For purposes of these analyses, Barclays excluded any results
with negative values.

EarthLink Standalone Valuation: Based upon its professional judgments discussed above, Barclays selected a range of EV to calendar year
2017 estimated EBITDA multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x for EarthLink. Barclays applied this range to EarthLink’s projected calendar year 2017
estimated EBITDA, as set out in the Windstream EarthLink Projections, to calculate a range of implied EVs of EarthLink. After deriving
implied EVs for EarthLink, Barclays derived implied equity values per share by subtracting EarthLink’s net debt as of September 30, 2016
from the implied EVs and dividing the result by the number of fully diluted shares of EarthLink common stock calculated using
information provided to Barclays by Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of
EarthLink common stock of $3.78 to $5.38 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the EarthLink EBITDA Range).

Based upon its professional judgments discussed above, Barclays also selected a range of EV to calendar year 2017 estimated Op. FCF
multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x for EarthLink. Barclays applied this range to EarthLink’s projected calendar year 2017 estimated Op. FCF, as
set out in the Windstream EarthLink Projections, to calculate a range of implied EVs of EarthLink. After deriving implied EVs for
EarthLink, Barclays derived implied equity values per share by subtracting EarthLink’s net debt as of September 30, 2016 from the
implied EVs and dividing the result by the number of fully diluted shares of EarthLink common stock calculated using information
provided to Barclays by Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of EarthLink
Common Stock of $5.34 to $8.84 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the EarthLink Op. FCF Range).

Implied Exchange Ratio: Using the ranges of implied equity values per share for Windstream and EarthLink calculated using the
comparable companies analyses summarized above, Barclays calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios. Barclays calculated the low
end of the calendar year 2017 estimated EBITDA implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the EarthLink EBITDA Range
by the high end of the Windstream EBITDA Range, and Barclays calculated the high end of the calendar year 2017 estimated EBITDA
implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high end of the EarthLink EBITDA Range by the low end of the Windstream EBITDA
Range. These calculations resulted in a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.196x to 0.794x.

Barclays calculated the low end of the calendar year 2017E Op. FCF implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the
EarthLink Op. FCF Range by the high end of the Windstream Op. FCF Range. Barclays was unable to calculate a high end of the calendar
year 2017E Op. FCF implied exchange ratio range because dividing the high end of the EarthLink Op. FCF Range by the low end of the
Windstream Op. FCF Range resulted in an undefined value. Therefore, these calculations resulted in only a lower bound implied exchange
ratio of 1.044x.

The following summarizes the result of these calculations:

Range of Implied Exchange Ratios
Low      High

Calendar Year 2017E EBITDA 0.196x    –      0.794x
Calendar Year 2017E Op. FCF 1.044x    –   Undefined

Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis

Barclays reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples paid in selected other transactions that Barclays, based on its
experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed relevant. Barclays chose such transactions based on, among other things, the
similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to EarthLink with respect to the industry, business mix, margins and other
financial and operating characteristics of their respective businesses.

The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were diverse and there are
inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Windstream, EarthLink and the companies included
in the selected precedent transaction analysis. Accordingly, Barclays believed that a purely quantitative selected precedent transaction
analysis would not be particularly meaningful in the context of considering the mergers. Barclays therefore made qualitative judgments
concerning differences between the characteristics of the selected precedent transactions and the mergers which would affect the
acquisition values of the selected target companies and EarthLink.

Based upon its professional judgments discussed above, Barclays selected a range of last twelve month (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as LTM) EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 6.0x. Barclays applied this range to EarthLink’s estimated 2016
EBITDA, as set forth in the Windstream EarthLink Projections, to calculate a range of implied EVs of EarthLink. After deriving implied
EVs for EarthLink, Barclays derived implied equity values per share by subtracting EarthLink’s net debt as of September 30, 2016 from
the implied EVs and dividing the result by the number of fully diluted shares of EarthLink common stock calculated using information
provided by Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of EarthLink common
stock of $5.37 to $7.13 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the 2016E EBITDA Range).

Based upon its professional judgments discussed above, Barclays selected a range of next twelve month (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as NTM) EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 6.0x. Barclays applied this range to EarthLink’s estimated 2017
EBITDA, as set out in the Windstream EarthLink Projections, to calculate a range of implied EVs of EarthLink. After deriving implied
EVs for EarthLink, Barclays derived implied equity values per share by subtracting EarthLink’s net debt as of September 30, 2016 from
the implied EVs and dividing the result by the number of fully diluted shares of EarthLink common stock calculated using information
provided by Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of EarthLink common
stock of $4.58 to $6.18 (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the 2017E EBITDA Range).

Implied Exchange Ratio: Using the ranges of implied equity values per share for EarthLink calculated using the precedent transaction
analyses summarized above, Barclays calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios. Barclays calculated the low end of the LTM EBITDA
multiple implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the 2016E EBITDA Range by Windstream’s November 3, 2016 closing
share price on the NASDAQ (the last full trading day prior to news reports of a potential merger of Windstream and EarthLink), and
Barclays calculated the high end of the LTM EBITDA multiple implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high end of the 2016E
EBITDA Range by Windstream’s November 3, 2016 closing share price on the NASDAQ (the last full trading day prior to news reports of
a potential merger of Windstream and EarthLink). These calculations resulted in a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.792x to 1.051x.

Barclays calculated the low end of the NTM EBITDA multiple implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the 2017E
EBITDA Range by Windstream’s November 3, 2016 closing share price on the NASDAQ (the last full trading day prior to news reports of
a potential merger of Windstream and EarthLink), and Barclays calculated the high end of the NTM EBITDA multiple implied exchange
ratio range by dividing the high end of the 2017E EBITDA Range by Windstream’s November 3, 2016 closing share price on the
NASDAQ (the last full trading day prior to news reports of a potential merger of Windstream and EarthLink). These calculations resulted
in a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.676x to 0.912x.

The following summarizes the result of these calculations:

Range of Implied Exchange Ratios
Multiple Range     Low   High

LTM EBITDA Multiple 5.0x – 6.0x 0.792x –   1.051x
NTM EBITDA Multiple 5.0x – 6.0x 0.676x –   0.912x

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

In order to estimate the present value of Windstream common stock and of EarthLink common stock, Barclays performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of Windstream and EarthLink. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a
valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset. “Present value” refers to the current
value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into
account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.

Windstream Standalone Valuation: To calculate the estimated EV of Windstream using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays added
(i) Windstream’s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 based on the Windstream Projections to
(ii) the “terminal value” of Windstream as of December 31, 2019, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range of
selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected earnings before interest and
taxes and adding back depreciation and amortization expense, and subtracting capital expenditures and capital lease expenses. The residual
value of Windstream at the end of the forecast period, or “terminal value,” was estimated by applying a range of terminal value multiples
of 4.5x to 5.5x, which was derived by analyzing the results from the selected comparable company analysis and applying such range to the
Windstream Projections. The range of after-tax discount rates of 7.00% to 8.00% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted
average cost of capital of Windstream and the comparable companies discussed above. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices
per share of Windstream by subtracting estimated net debt as of December 31, 2016 from the estimated EV using the discounted cash flow
method and dividing such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Windstream common stock calculated using information
provided by Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of $1.13 to $12.83 (which
we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Windstream DCF Range). This range includes the present value of certain
Windstream net operating losses contained in the NOL Projections, which Barclays calculated to have a present value of $2.58 per share of
Windstream common stock. In calculating the present value of the Windstream net operating losses contained in the NOL Projections,
Barclays, upon the advice and at the instruction of Windstream management, assumed a tax rate of 35% and used a discount rate range of
5.85% to 7.50%.

EarthLink Standalone Valuation: To calculate the estimated EV of EarthLink using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays added (i)
EarthLink’s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 based on the Windstream EarthLink
Projections to (ii) the “terminal value” of EarthLink as of December 31, 2019, and discounted such amount to its present value using a
range of selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected earnings before interest
and taxes and adding back depreciation and amortization expense, and subtracting capital expenditures. The residual value of EarthLink at
the end of the forecast period, or “terminal value,” was estimated by applying a range of terminal value multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x, which
was derived by analyzing the results from the selected comparable company analysis and applying such range to the Windstream
EarthLink Projections. The range of after-tax discount rates of 7.00% to 8.00% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average
cost of capital of EarthLink and the comparable companies discussed above. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share
of EarthLink by subtracting net debt as of September 30, 2016 (Windstream did not receive projections with respect to EarthLink net debt
as of December 31, 2016, and thus Windstream instructed Barclays to use EarthLink net debt as of September 30, 2016, as that figure
represented Windstream management’s best available estimate and judgment with respect to EarthLink net debt as of December 31, 2016)
from the estimated EV using the discounted cash flow method and dividing such amount by the fully diluted

number of shares of EarthLink common stock calculated using information provided to Barclays by Windstream management. These
calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of $3.87 to $5.12 (which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Windstream EarthLink DCF Range). This range includes the present value of certain EarthLink net operating
losses contained in the NOL Projections, which Barclays calculated to have a present value of $1.44 per share of EarthLink common
stock. In calculating the present value of the EarthLink net operating losses contained in the NOL Projections, Barclays, upon the advice
and at the instruction of Windstream management, assumed a tax rate of 35% and used a discount rate range of 6.18% to 7.50%.

Barclays also calculated an alternative estimated EV for EarthLink using the discounted cash flow method based on the EarthLink
Projections. To calculate the alternative EV of EarthLink using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays added (i) EarthLink’s projected
after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 based on the EarthLink Projections to (ii) the “terminal value” of
EarthLink as of December 31, 2019, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected discount rates. The after-tax
unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected earnings before interest and taxes and adding back depreciation and
amortization expense and subtracting capital expenditures. The residual value of EarthLink at the end of the forecast period, or “terminal
value,” was estimated by applying a range of terminal value multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x, which was derived by analyzing the results from the
selected comparable company analysis and applying such range to the EarthLink Projections. The range of after-tax discount rates of
7.00% to 8.00% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of EarthLink and the comparable companies.
Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of EarthLink by subtracting net debt as of September 30, 2016 (Windstream
did not receive projections with respect to EarthLink net debt as of December 31, 2016, and thus Windstream instructed Barclays to use
EarthLink net debt as of September 30, 2016, as that figure represented Windstream management’s best available estimate and judgment
with respect to EarthLink net debt as of December 31, 2016) from the estimated EV using the discounted cash flow method and dividing
such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of EarthLink common stock calculated using information provided to Barclays by
Windstream management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of $5.62 to $7.38 (which we refer to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the EarthLink DCF Range). This range includes the present value of certain EarthLink net
operating losses contained in the NOL Projections, which Barclays calculated to have a present value of $1.44 per share of EarthLink
common stock. In calculating the present value of the EarthLink net operating losses contained in the NOL Projections, Barclays, upon the
advice and at the instruction of Windstream management, assumed a tax rate of 35% and used a discount rate range of 6.18% to 7.50%.

The Windstream and EarthLink DCF analyses summarized above do not include the value of the Expected Synergies. Using publicly
available financial data and the Expected Synergies, Barclays calculated the present value, on a per share basis, of the Expected Synergies
using a discounted cash flow method based on certain assumptions provided to Barclays by Windstream management, including a discount
rate of 7.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of negative 3%. These calculations resulted in an implied value of $3.82 per share of EarthLink
common stock, pro forma for the mergers and an implied value of $4.67 per share of Windstream common stock, pro forma for the
proposed transaction.

Implied Exchange Ratio: Using the ranges of implied equity values per share for Windstream and EarthLink calculated using the
discounted cash flow analyses summarized above, Barclays calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios. Barclays calculated the low end
of the Windstream DCF implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the Windstream EarthLink DCF Range by the high end
of the Windstream DCF Range, and Barclays calculated the high end of the Windstream DCF implied

exchange ratio range by dividing the high end of the Windstream EarthLink DCF Range by the low end of the Windstream DCF Range.
These calculations resulted in a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.302x to 4.529x.

Barclays also calculated an alternative range of implied exchange ratios using the EarthLink DCF Range and the Windstream DCF Range.
Barclays calculated the low end of the EarthLink DCF implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the EarthLink DCF Range
by the high end of the Windstream DCF Range, and Barclays calculated the high end of the Windstream DCF implied exchange ratio
range by dividing the high end of the EarthLink DCF Range by the low end of the Windstream DCF Range. These calculations resulted in
a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.438x to 6.521x.

The following summarizes the result of these calculations:

     Range of Implied Exchange Ratios

Windstream EarthLink DCF / Windstream DCF                    0.302x –  4.529x

General

Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in
the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes,
negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
estate, corporate and other purposes. The Windstream Board selected Barclays because of its familiarity with Windstream and its
qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions
generally, as well as its substantial experience in transactions comparable to the proposed transaction.

Barclays is acting as financial advisor to Windstream in connection with the proposed transaction. As compensation for its services in
connection with the proposed transaction, Windstream agreed to pay Barclays $1.5 million upon the delivery of Barclays’ opinion, which
is referred to as the “Opinion Fee” and which becomes payable upon the closing or the termination of the mergers. The Opinion Fee was
not contingent upon the conclusion of Barclays’ opinion or the consummation of the proposed transaction. In addition, Windstream has
agreed to reimburse Barclays for expenses incurred in connection with the mergers and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that
may arise out of its engagement by Windstream and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion. Barclays and its affiliates have performed various
investment banking and financial services for Windstream and its affiliates in the past, and it expects to perform such services in the
future, and has received, and expects to receive, customary fees for such services. Specifically, in the past two years, Barclays has
performed the following investment banking and financial services for Windstream and its affiliates: (i) Joint Bookrunner and Joint Lead
Arranger in connection with Windstream’s 2016 Term Loan B offering; (ii) Joint Bookrunner in connection with Windstream’s 2016
secondary equity offering of shares of Communications Sales & Leasing Inc. and participating creditor in connection with the related debt-
for-equity exchange; and (iii) Joint Bookrunner in connection with Windstream’s 2015 Revolving Credit Facility amendment and
extension. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Barclays has received as consideration for such investment banking and
financial services $3.3 million. In the past two years, Barclays has not performed any investment banking or financial services for
EarthLink or any of its affiliates.

Barclays and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management and
other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of its business, Barclays and affiliates may actively trade and effect
transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other
obligations) of Windstream and EarthLink for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold
long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.

Certain Prospective Financial Information of Windstream

In the course of their mutual due diligence, on October 21, 2016, Windstream provided EarthLink with the Windstream Projections and
EarthLink provided Windstream with the EarthLink Projections. In addition, Windstream’s management made certain adjustments to the
EarthLink Projections that they deemed appropriate, which yielded the Windstream EarthLink Projections (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, together with the Windstream Projections, the EarthLink Windstream Projections and the EarthLink
Projections, as the Projections). Each of the Windstream Projections, the EarthLink Projections and the Windstream EarthLink Projections
were provided to the Windstream Board to assist the Windstream Board in its evaluation of the strategic rationale for the mergers and were
provided to Barclays in connection with its financial analysis described above under “—Opinion of Windstream’s Financial Advisor”
beginning on page 97. EarthLink was also provided with a set of financial forecasts of Windstream that were nearly identical to the
Windstream Projections, but which omitted Operating Cash Flow projections for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. EarthLink
provided to Windstream extrapolations prepared by EarthLink for the omitted Operating Cash Flow forecasts, which EarthLink estimated
to be approximately $446 million for 2018 and $477 million for 2019, which Windstream indicated were generally consistent with
Windstream’s internal forecasts. The forecasts as provided to, and adjusted by, EarthLink are referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the EarthLink Windstream Projections. Each of the EarthLink Windstream Projections and the EarthLink
Projections were also used by the EarthLink Board in its evaluation of the strategic rationale for the mergers and were furnished to and
used by EarthLink’s financial advisors in connection with their respective financial analyses as described under “—Opinions of
EarthLink’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 71.

The Projections, which are summarized below, are unaudited and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance
with published guidelines of the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information or GAAP. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not examined, compiled or performed any procedures with
respect to the accompanying prospective financial information of Windstream and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not
express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reports incorporated by
reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus relate to Windstream’s historical financial information. The inclusion of the Projections,
which are summarized below, in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that any of Windstream,
EarthLink or any other recipient of the Projections considered, or now considers, them to be necessarily predictive of actual future results.
The inclusion of the Projections, which are summarized below, in this joint proxy statement/prospectus will not be deemed an admission
or representation by Windstream that such Projections are material. The Projections make numerous assumptions, as further described
below, many of which are beyond the control of Windstream and EarthLink, and do not reflect any transaction or event that has occurred
or that may occur that was not anticipated at the time the Projections were prepared. The Projections cover multiple years and such
information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Windstream does not intend to update or revise the
Projections. The Projections are forward-looking statements. For more information on factors which may cause Windstream or
EarthLink’s future financial results to materially vary from those projected in the Projections, see “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 34 and “Risk Factors” beginning on page 36.

The Projections include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Operating Cash Flow as measures of cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of restructuring charges, pension costs and
share-based compensation. Operating Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDAR is defined
as operating income before depreciation, amortization and rent expenses, adjusted for the impact of restructuring charges, pension costs
and share-based compensation.

While each of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Operating Cash Flow is a recognizable measure of operating performance for
companies in the industry in which Windstream and EarthLink operate, the measure may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures across companies, including between Windstream and EarthLink. Additionally, the Windstream Board and Barclays may have
differing interpretations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Operating Cash Flow.

(1)       After providing the Windstream Projections to Barclays and the Windstream Board, Windstream provided Barclays an updated

fiscal year 2016 total revenue figure of $5,401,000,000, which represented a trended fiscal year 2016 revenue view based on actual
revenue results through September 2016.

 
(2) This Revenue projection includes the results from EarthLink's information-technology services business, which EarthLink sold in

February 2016. This business accounted for $3 million in revenue. For purposes of Barclays' financial analyses, Windstream
instructed Barclays to use $956,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 total revenue, which is pro forma for this sale.

Windstream does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable
certainty future changes in interest rates, changes in the company’s effective income tax rates or the future impact of unusual gains and
losses, acquisition-related expenses and

purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could
be material to Windstream’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Interests of Windstream Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers

The mergers do not constitute a “change in control” under Windstream’s employment or change in control agreements entered into with its
executive officers and therefore the merger will not trigger any benefits under such agreements. Likewise, the mergers do not constitute a
“change in control” under the equity compensation plans of Windstream and therefore will not cause any acceleration of outstanding
Windstream equity awards.

Interests of EarthLink Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers

When considering the recommendation of the EarthLink Board that stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, stockholders should
be aware that EarthLink’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to,
interests of other EarthLink stockholders generally. The EarthLink Board was aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such
interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the mergers and in
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the EarthLink stockholders. In the discussion below, EarthLink has quantified
payments and benefits to its executive officers and non-employee directors that may be due in connection with the mergers.

Treatment of Equity Awards

Options. At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of EarthLink common stock, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Windstream common stock equal to (i) the
product of the number of shares of EarthLink common stock underlying such option and the exchange ratio, less (ii) that number of shares
of Windstream common stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such option with a
fair market value (determined based on the closing price of EarthLink common stock on the business day immediately preceding the
closing date of the merger) equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate exercise price of such EarthLink option plus (y) any withholding on such
option and (B) the exchange ratio, provided that any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same
manner as any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration.

Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding EarthLink restricted stock unit will be assumed by Windstream and converted into a Windstream
restricted stock unit with respect to that number of shares of Windstream common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares
of EarthLink common stock subject to such EarthLink restricted stock unit by the exchange ratio, provided that any resulting fractional
shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same manner as any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock
payable as merger consideration. The other terms of the EarthLink restricted stock unit, including vesting, shall continue to apply to the
Windstream restricted stock unit.

Executive Officer Options Value

In addition to the merger consideration related to outstanding shares currently held by EarthLink’s executive officers, assuming completion
of the merger on December 31, 2016, approximate values related to outstanding and unexercised options, vested (i.e., options that
previously vested according to their standard terms; not options that become vested by operation of the merger) or unvested with respect to
EarthLink’s executive officers are as follows:

  Value of Unvested  Value of Vested  Total Value of
Executive      Options ($)      Options ($)      Options ($)

  Joseph F. Eazor $18,000 $18,000 $36,000
  Louis M. Alterman -- -- --
  Valerie C. Benjamin -- -- --
  Gerard Brossard -- -- --
  Samuel R DeSimone, Jr. -- -- --
  John T. Dobbins -- -- --
  Bradley A. Ferguson -- -- --
  Jacob J. Ferro -- -- --
  Richard C. Froehlich -- -- --

The foregoing information is based on such executives’ equity compensation holdings as of December 31, 2016 and assume a price per
share of EarthLink common stock of $5.09 (the average closing price of shares of EarthLink common stock on the five days following the
announcement of the mergers).

Change-in-Control Accelerated Vesting and Severance Plan

EarthLink maintains the Change-in-Control Accelerated Vesting and Severance Plan (the “CIC Plan”), which provides that the benefits
described below will be paid to the executive officers in connection with a qualifying termination in connection with the mergers.

The CIC Plan contains two different benefit categories based on the employee’s position with EarthLink, one for our executive officers
and one for other plan participants. All of EarthLink’s executive officers participate in the CIC Plan other than Mr. Eazor who receives
change in control benefits under his employment agreement and Mr. Dobbins who will receive benefits under his offer letter with
Windstream (discussed below).

If at any time within 24 months after a Change in Control (defined below) occurs, (i) the employment of an executive officer is terminated
by EarthLink for any reason other than Cause (defined below), disability or death or (ii) an executive officer voluntarily terminates his
employment for Good Reason (defined below), the executive officer is entitled to receive the following benefits: (a) a severance payment
equal to 150% of the sum of the executive officer’s salary plus bonus target less the amount of a non-compete payment (which is 66 2/3%
of the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and annual target bonus); (b) the non-compete payment and (c) payment of all amounts
payable with respect to the executive officer’s elected COBRA coverage (including for spouse and dependents) for 18 months from
termination. The severance payment and the non-compete payment will be payable in a lump sum within 30 days of the termination date.
The COBRA coverage amounts will be payable no less frequently than monthly over the 18 month period.

The CIC Plan also provides for equity award accelerated vesting benefits. If an executive officer’s stock options are assumed or continued
after a Change in Control, all outstanding stock options granted on or before the Change in Control will vest and be exercisable in full, if
not already fully vested, on a

111



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 127/364

termination of the employee’s employment by EarthLink without Cause or termination by the employee with Good Reason, within 24
months after the Change in Control occurs; however, if his or her stock options are not assumed or continued after the Change in Control,
all outstanding stock options will vest and be exercisable in full contemporaneously with the Change in Control, if not already fully vested.
If an executive officer’s restricted stock units are assumed or continued after a Change in Control, generally all outstanding restricted stock
units granted on or before the change in Control will vest and be earned and payable in full, if not already fully vested, on a termination of
the employee’s employment by EarthLink without Cause or termination by the employee with Good Reason, within 24 months after the
Change in Control occurs; however, if his or her restricted stock units are not assumed or continued after the Change in Control, generally
all outstanding restricted stock units will vest and be earned and payable in full contemporaneously with the Change in Control, if not
already fully vested.

The CIC Plan restricts the participants from competing, directly or indirectly, with EarthLink or soliciting certain of its employees and
officers for a period of 18 months following a qualifying termination of employment. The CIC Plan also requires the participants to
execute a release and waiver for the benefit of EarthLink prior to any payments being made under the plan.

EarthLink has the right to amend the CIC Plan from time to time and may terminate it at any time; provided, however, that for a certain
period of time before a Change in Control (as described in the CIC Plan) or after a Change in Control in EarthLink occurs, (i) no
amendment may be made that diminishes any employee’s rights following such Change in Control and (ii) the CIC Plan may not be
terminated.

For purposes of the CIC Plan, “Change in Control” generally means a transaction pursuant to which any person acquires more than 50% of
the voting power of EarthLink or any merger, reorganization or similar event where the owners of the voting stock of EarthLink before the
event do not own voting stock representing at least 50% of the voting power of EarthLink or our successor after the event. For purposes of
the CIC Plan, the merger will constitute a Change in Control. For purposes of the CIC Plan, “Cause” generally covers the willful,
continued failure to perform employment duties after written notice or willful misconduct that is materially injurious to EarthLink, and
“Good Reason” generally covers assignment of duties inconsistent with position or a substantial change in position, reduction of base
salary or bonus, relocation of more than 35 miles from current base, failure to effect any incentive or benefit plan, failure of a successor to
assume the CIC Plan or any termination that is not for “Cause.”

Short-Term Incentive Bonus Plan

Under EarthLink’s 2016 Short-Term Incentive Bonus Plan, if any of the executive officers are terminated for any reason other than for
“cause” or disability following a “change in control” during the 2016 bonus period, such executive officer will be entitled to a bonus
payable for the full bonus period as paid to the other participants in the bonus plan and assuming an individual performance factor of
100%. However, the bonus paid to the executive officer will be pro rata in that it will be based only on the executive’s compensation
through the date of termination. The merger would be considered a “change in control” under the bonus plan. Such bonus payment would
be paid in lump sum at the time of payout for the other participants, no later than March 31, 2017.

Employment Agreement with Mr. Eazor

EarthLink entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Eazor in connection with his appointment as EarthLink’s Chief Executive
Officer and President, which was amended and restated in 2016. The employment agreement with Mr. Eazor has a term which currently
expires on August 31, 2019 and may be terminated on 90 days notice prior to the end of a term. However, upon a “change in control,” the
term automatically extends until 24 months following the change in control. The merger would be considered a

112



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 128/364

“change in control” under the employment agreement. The employment agreement incorporates into one document all benefits that Mr.
Eazor would receive upon termination of employment, including upon a change in control, and, as a result, Mr. Eazor does not participate
in the CIC Plan.

Under the employment agreement, Mr. Eazor is entitled to certain benefits if he is terminated for any reason other than for “cause” (as
defined in the employment agreement) or if Mr. Eazor terminates his employment for “good reason” (as defined in the employment
agreement). For purposes of the employment agreement, “cause” generally covers acts of fraud, conviction of any felony or willful,
continued failure to perform his duties to the company and “good reason” generally covers the following acts, which are not cured within
30 days after written notice: significant diminution of his position, failure by EarthLink to comply with the employment agreement, any
requirement to be based outside of Atlanta, notice by EarthLink of non-renewal of the employment agreement or a breach by EarthLink of
the employment agreement. In either such case, Mr. Eazor will receive an amount equal to (i) 200% of the sum of his base salary and his
target bonus payment for the year in which the termination occurs less (ii) the amount of his non-compete payment (which is the sum of
his base salary and annual target bonus for the year in which the termination of the employment occurs). Mr. Eazor also would receive the
non-compete payment and payment of all amounts payable with respect to Mr. Eazor’s elected COBRA coverage (including for spouse
and dependents) for 18 months from termination. These amounts would all be payable in a lump sum within 30 days of the date of
termination. The employment agreement also contains provisions for the treatment of outstanding equity awards that are substantially
similar to the provisions in the CIC Plan and payment of a pro-rata bonus substantially similar to the provisions in the Short-Term
Incentive Bonus Plan.

As an additional inducement to retain Mr. Eazor’s services at the time the employment agreement was amended and restated in 2016,
EarthLink also made a cash retention payment to Mr. Eazor of $2.6 million. If EarthLink has become party to a definitive agreement to
consummate a transaction that would result in a “change in control” in the twelve months following August 12, 2016 and the transaction
that would result in the “change in control” is consummated, Mr. Eazor will be required to reimburse the cash retention payment to
EarthLink.

The employment agreement restricts Mr. Eazor from competing, directly or indirectly, with EarthLink or soliciting certain of its employees
and officers during the term of the employment agreement and for a period of 12 months following his termination of employment. The
employment agreement also requires Mr. Eazor to execute a release for the benefit of EarthLink prior to any payments being made under
the agreement.

Indemnification and D&O Insurance

Through the sixth anniversary of the effective date of the merger, Windstream has agreed that it will or will cause the surviving company
to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the present and former officers and directors of EarthLink and its
subsidiaries against certain costs, liabilities and expenses arising out of or pertaining to (i) such person’s service as an officer, director,
fiduciary or agent of EarthLink or its subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring or services performed by such director or officer at
the request of EarthLink at or before the effective time of the merger (including the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby), whether asserted prior to, at or after the effective time of the merger. For a period of six years from the effective date of the
merger, Windstream also is required to maintain directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability coverage containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate as EarthLink’s directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability policies as
in effect on the effective date of the merger, subject to certain limits on the policy annual premiums as set forth in the merger agreement.
Alternatively, EarthLink may purchase a six-year prepaid “tail” policy providing substantially equivalent

benefits, which Windstream must cause to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term and cause the surviving company to honor
any obligations thereunder (or if cancelled, which Windstream must replace for any remaining term). A more complete description of the
indemnification and insurance rights provided to EarthLink’s directors and officers under the merger agreement is under the heading “The
Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 145.

Continuing Executive Officer and Non-Employee Directors

Certain executive officers and key employees of EarthLink and certain members of the EarthLink Board may be offered post-closing
employment agreements or arrangements, which may include cash, stock or other equity compensation and co-investment opportunities.
Windstream has entered into an offer letter in connection with the mergers with Mr. John Dobbins, EarthLink's Executive Vice President
of Network Operations. The new offer letter is generally consistent with the terms of other compensation arrangements with Windstream
executives. Further details of Mr. Dobbins' offer letter can be found in the “Offer Letter with Mr. Dobbins” section below. The merger
agreement provides that the EarthLink Board will appoint three members to sit on the Windstream Board effective as of the effective time
of the merger. The directors and executive officers of EarthLink that may continue on with Windstream post-closing have not been
determined as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Offer Letter with Mr. Dobbins

The following is a summary of the offer letter entered into between Windstream and Mr. Dobbins. All discussion between Windstream and
Mr. Dobbins that resulted in the offer letter occurred subsequent to November 5, 2016, the date that the EarthLink Board approved the
merger agreement. The offer letter will become effective on the consummation of the mergers.

Under the offer letter, Mr. Dobbins will serve as Executive Vice President of Access, pursuant to which he will receive (i) an annual base
salary of $385,000, (ii) an annual bonus opportunity targeted at 125% of his annual base salary, and (iii) a cash signing bonus of $385,000
to be paid within thirty days of the closing of the mergers (to be repaid in full upon a non-qualifying termination of his employment within
twelve months of the mergers). He will also participate in Windstream's long term incentive compensation plan with his 2017 long term
incentive equal to 125% of his annual base salary. In addition, Mr. Dobbins will be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans and
programs available to similarly situated employees. Mr. Dobbins' EarthLink equity awards that are outstanding as of immediately before
the consummation of the mergers will continue to be outstanding and generally subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable award
agreements, except that applicable definitions will have the meanings set forth in his offer letter.

On the effective date of the offer letter, Mr. Dobbins will forfeit all benefits he would be entitled to under the CIC Plan (described above).
In exchange, Mr. Dobbins will be party to a Windstream Change in Control Agreement pursuant to which he will receive severance
benefits generally consistent with Windstream executives.

If, during the period of the offer letter, Mr. Dobbins is terminated for any reason other than cause, disability, or death and a change in
control of Windstream has not occurred, then subject to his compliance with the terms of the offer letter, he is entitled to: (i) to twelve (12)
months of his base salary, plus (ii) an amount in respect of his target bonus in effect at the time of the termination, plus (iii) a prorated
portion of his target bonus in effect at the time of the termination (prorated based on the number of days Mr. Dobbins has been employed
during the year in which such termination occurs), of which 50%

114



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 130/364

of the amount is generally payable in lump sum and 50% is payable in installments. Additionally, on such a termination any unvested
EarthLink restricted stock units that were converted to Windstream restricted stock units at Closing will be fully vested as of the date of
termination and any such restricted stock units that were performance-based will be deemed to vest at the maximum vesting level.

If, within twenty four months of the effective date of his offer letter, Mr. Dobbins resigns for good reason other than in connection with a
change in control of Windstream, then subject to his compliance with the terms of the offer letter, he is entitled to: (i) eighteen months of
his annual base salary; plus (ii) one and one-half (1.5) times his target bonus in effect at the time of the termination which amount is
generally payable in lump sum. Additionally, on such a resignation for good reason, any unvested EarthLink restricted stock units that
were converted to Windstream restricted stock units at closing of the merger will be fully vested as of the date of termination and any such
restricted stock units that were performance-based will be deemed to vest at the maximum vesting level. For this purpose, "good reason"
generally means the occurrence of any of the following (i) his assignment of duties inconsistent with his position or a substantial adverse
alteration in his responsibilities; (ii) a reduction in his annual base salary; (iii) the relocation more than 35 miles away, except for required
business travel; (iv) Windstream's failure to continue any material compensation plan in which he participates, unless he is provided an
equitable alternative arrangement; or (v) Windstream's failure to continue to provide him with substantially similar benefits.

Mr. Dobbins' receipt of any severance payments is subject to his signing and not revoking a general release of claims on or before the 45th
day following his separation from service. Mr. Dobbins is also subject to confidentiality and non-disclosure covenants as well as non-
competition and non-solicitation covenants for 12 months post-termination. In addition, amounts payable under the offer letter are subject
to the terms of the combined company's clawback policy. If payments under the agreement would be subject to any "golden parachute"
excise tax, the payments will be reduced to an amount that is not subject to such tax if Mr. Dobbins would retain more benefit on an after-
tax basis.

Other Benefit Plans

Following the effective time of the merger, Windstream will honor all EarthLink benefit plans as in effect immediately before the effective
time of the merger, provided that Windstream will not be limited or otherwise impaired in amending or terminating such benefit plans in
accordance with their terms. A more complete description of employee benefits to be provided to EarthLink’s employees under the merger
agreement is under the heading “The Merger Agreement—Employee Matters” beginning on page 143.

Quantification of Potential Payments to EarthLink’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers

The information set forth in the tables below are intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosures of
information about certain compensation for each of EarthLink’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
mergers and assumes, among other things, that the named executive officers will experience a qualifying termination of employment
immediately following the consummation of the merger.

Please note that the amounts described below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the completion of the mergers. For
purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed:

● December 31, 2016 as the closing date of the mergers,

● a termination of each named executive officer’s employment on December 31, 2016 by the surviving company that constitutes a
qualifying termination, and
 

● amounts are based on compensation and benefits in effect on December 31, 2016, which may be subject to change prior to the
closing date of the mergers.

____________________

(1) (A) The cash amount payable to Messrs. Alterman, Brossard, Ferguson and Froehlich is a lump sum cash payment consisting of the
following components: (a) a severance payment equal to 150% of the sum of the executive officer’s salary plus bonus target, less the
amount of the non-compete payment (which is 66 2/3% of the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and annual target bonus);
(b) the non-compete payment; (c) the pro rata bonus amount due under the 2016 Short-Term Incentive Bonus Plan; and (d) all
amounts payable with respect to the executive officer’s elected COBRA coverage (including for spouse and dependents) for 18
months from the termination.

          
(B) The cash amount payable to Mr. Eazor is a lump-sum cash payment, consisting of the following components: (a) a severance
payment equal to 200% of the sum of his base salary and his target bonus payment for the year in which the termination occurs less
the amount of his non-compete payment (which is the sum of his base salary and annual target bonus for the year in which the
termination of employment occurs); (b) the non-compete payment; (c) the pro rata bonus amount due under the 2016 Short-Term
Incentive Bonus Plan; and (d) all amounts payable with respect to Mr. Eazor’s elected COBRA coverage (including for spouse and
dependents) for 18 months from the termination. The cash amount payable to Mr. Eazor provided in the table above has also been
reduced by the previously-paid $2.6 million retention payment amount in accordance with the terms of Mr. Eazor’s employment
agreement.

The severance payment, non-compete payment and COBRA payment components of the cash amount for the named executive
officers (other than Mr. Eazor) are “double-trigger” (i.e., they are contingent upon a qualifying termination in the 24 months
following the consummation of the mergers). All components of the cash amount for Mr. Eazor are only contingent upon a
qualifying termination (the mergers need not be completed prior to the termination). In addition, the pro-rata portion of the 2016
bonus is only contingent upon a qualifying termination (and the mergers do not necessarily need to be completed prior to the
termination). See “—Change-in-Control Accelerated Vesting and Severance Plan,” “—Employment Agreement with Mr. Eazor” and
“—Short Term Incentive Bonus Plan” for more information.

 
         The cash amounts assume that the bonus under the 2016 Short-Term Incentive Bonus Plan is earned at the target level.

(2) As described in more detail above in “—Treatment of Equity Awards,” upon the consummation of the merger, (a) options in respect
of EarthLink common stock held by the named executive officers would vest (to the extent unvested) and be converted into the right
to receive shares of Windstream common stock, and (b) restricted stock units in respect of EarthLink common stock held by the
named executive officers would be converted into restricted stock unit with respect to Windstream common stock, but the pre-
existing terms, including vesting, shall continue to apply. However, under the CIC Plan and the Employment Agreement with Mr.
Eazor, the restricted stock units would vest in full in connection with a qualifying termination in the 24 months following the
mergers (or just a qualifying termination, in the case of Mr. Eazor). Therefore, the vesting of the options is “single-trigger” (i.e., they
are payable automatically as a result of the consummation of the merger), however the vesting of the restricted stock units is
“double-trigger” and only occurs upon a qualifying termination following the merger.

 
         The amounts above and in the table below assume a price per share of EarthLink common stock of $5.09 (the average closing price

of shares of EarthLink common stock on the five days following the announcement of the mergers). The estimated value of each
type of equity-based award held by the named executive officers that would become vested in connection with the consummation of
the mergers is set forth in the table below.

Name      Options ($)     Restricted Stock Units ($)
  Joseph F. Eazor $36,000 $7,050,246
  Louis M. Alterman -- $1,482,951
  Gerard Brossard -- $1,242,331
  John T. Dobbins -- $1,187,446
  Bradley A. Ferguson -- $1,324,754
  Rick C. Froehlich -- $1,441,228

(3)      Other compensation represents deferred dividend payments to be paid upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units.
 
(4) The total amounts do not reflect any reductions to “parachute payments” as defined by Section 280G of the Code that may be

economically beneficial to the named executive officers in order to avoid the excise tax imposed on individuals receiving excess
parachute payments under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. A definitive analysis will depend on the effective date, the date of
termination (if any) of the named executive officer and certain other assumptions used in the calculation.

   
(5) Cash severance for Mr. Dobbins is discussed in the table in the below "Golden Parachute Compensation – Mr. Dobbins" section

beginning on page 118. Mr. Dobbins' cash severance is pursuant to the new offer letter entered into with Windstream in
contemplation of the mergers and is thus not subject to shareholder vote.

Golden Parachute Compensation – Mr. Dobbins

Only Mr. Dobbins may become entitled to such cash severance below under a new offer letter entered into between him and Windstream,
which will become effective upon completion of the mergers. Any potential severance is not subject to a shareholder vote. Because Mr.
Dobbins and Windstream entered into the offer letter in contemplation of the mergers, the table below identifies severance benefits payable
under the offer letter as payments and benefits that are based on or that otherwise relate to the merger. Additional information regarding
this agreement is set out in the section entitled "Interests of EarthLink Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers — Offer Letter
with Mr. Dobbins" beginning on page 114.

The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that might become payable to Mr. Dobbins, subject to execution of a release of
claims and compliance with certain noncompetition and other restrictive covenants. The estimates are based on multiple assumptions that
may or may not actually occur. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available and, as a result, the actual
amounts, if any, to be received by Mr. Dobbins may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set
forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The amounts set forth below have been calculated assuming (1) that the
mergers were completed on December 31, 2016 (which is the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus), (2) that Mr. Dobbins became entitled to the severance that would have been payable under the terms of his new
offer letter, and he experienced a qualifying termination of employment by Windstream on such date, and (3) a per share price of
EarthLink common stock of $5.09, the average per-share closing price of EarthLink's common stock over the first five business days
following the first public announcement of the merger agreement. Except for the cash sign-on bonus to which Mr. Dobbins is entitled
under the offer letter, no amounts shown in the table below would be paid absent a qualifying termination of employment (i.e., payable
solely by reason of completion of the mergers).

twelve (12) months of his base salary (equal to $385,000), plus (ii) an amount in respect of his target bonus in effect at the effective
time of the termination ($481,250), plus (iii) a prorated portion of his target bonus in effect at the time of the termination (prorated

"Cash" column also includes an amount equal to $385,000 in respect of Mr. Dobbins' cash signing bonus, payable upon
consummation of the mergers.

If, within twenty four months of the effective date of his offer letter, Mr. Dobbins resigns for good reason other than in connection
with a change in control of Windstream, he is entitled to a payment that would differ from the number in the column above and
would be equal to: (i) eighteen months of his annual base salary ($577,500); plus (ii) one and one-half (1.5) times his target bonus

the Mergers” section beginning on page 115 detailing treatment of EarthLink equity held by Mr. Dobbins subject to a shareholder
vote in connection with the mergers. The estimated value of the restricted stock units held by Mr. Dobbins that would become
vested upon a qualifying termination in connection with the consummation of the mergers is $1,187,446.

 
(3) Other compensation represents deferred dividend payments to be paid upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units.
   
(4) The total amounts do not reflect any reductions to "parachute payments" as defined by Section 280G of the Code that may be

economically beneficial to Mr. Dobbins in order to avoid the excise tax imposed on individuals receiving excess parachute
payments under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. A definitive analysis will depend on the effective date, the date of
termination (if any) of Mr. Dobbins and certain other assumptions used in the calculation.

Board of Directors Following the Mergers

Windstream has agreed prior to the closing of the mergers to increase the size of the Windstream Board to twelve members and to appoint
to the Windstream Board, effective as of the effective time of the merger, three members of the EarthLink Board, to be selected by
EarthLink and reasonably acceptable to Windstream, taking into account Windstream’s normal corporate governance process for selection
of directors to the Windstream Board.

The EarthLink designees will serve until the next annual meeting of Windstream stockholders. Windstream has agreed to nominate the
EarthLink designees for election to the Windstream Board at the first annual meeting immediately following the closing of the mergers
and solicit proxies in favor of their election using efforts no less than the efforts used to solicit proxies in favor of the election of the other
individuals nominated to the Windstream Board.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, EarthLink has not determined the identities of the EarthLink designees.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers

EarthLink and Windstream have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval from or notices to the DOJ, the FTC, the FCC,
certain PSCs and possibly various other federal, and local and state regulatory authorities. EarthLink and Windstream have completed the
filing of applications and notifications to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

Antitrust Clearance. Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the mergers may not be consummated
until notifications have been filed and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and
specified waiting periods have expired or have been terminated. EarthLink and Windstream filed the requisite notification forms under the
HSR Act with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC on November 17, 2016, and early termination of the HSR Act waiting period
was granted on December 19, 2016. Both before and after the termination of the waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority
to challenge the mergers on antitrust grounds.

In addition, the mergers may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which EarthLink and Windstream operate.
While EarthLink and Windstream believe there are substantial arguments to the contrary, these authorities may claim that there is
authority, under the applicable state and federal antitrust laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to prohibit the mergers under the
circumstances and based on the standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 135/364

be no assurance that one or more state attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the mergers. As of the date
of this document, neither Windstream nor EarthLink has been notified by any state attorney general indicating any plan to review the
mergers.

Other Requisite U.S. Approvals, Notices and Consents. Notifications and/or applications requesting approval must be submitted to
various federal and state regulatory organizations in connection with the mergers, including applications and notices to the FCC and
certain PSCs. EarthLink and Windstream have filed all the applications required to obtain these approvals and provided all required pre-
closing notices.

Timing. There can be no assurances that all of the regulatory approvals described above will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no
assurances as to the timing of any approvals, Windstream’s and EarthLink’s ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the
absence of any litigation challenging such approvals.

EarthLink and Windstream believe that the mergers do not raise substantial antitrust or other significant regulatory concerns. Although
EarthLink and Windstream believe that all required regulatory approvals necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement can be obtained, EarthLink and Windstream cannot be certain when or if these approvals will be obtained, or whether
these approvals can be obtained without the imposition of any condition or restriction that would have a material adverse effect on
EarthLink or Windstream. The parties’ obligation to complete the mergers is conditioned on the receipt or waiver of all the necessary
governmental or regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

It is presently contemplated that if any governmental approvals or actions are deemed by Windstream or EarthLink to be necessary or
appropriate, such approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or actions will be
obtained. The parties are required to use their reasonable best efforts to file all the necessary documentation and obtain all consents of third
parties that are necessary to complete the mergers and to comply with the terms and conditions of all consents, approvals and
authorizations of any third party or governmental entity.

Exchange of Shares in the Mergers

Prior to the effective time of the mergers, Windstream will appoint an exchange agent to handle the exchange of shares of EarthLink
common stock for shares of Windstream common stock. At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
EarthLink common stock (other than the cancelled shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common
stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Windstream common stock to which a holder of EarthLink common stock otherwise
would be entitled after giving effect to the exchange ratio, without the need for any action by the holders of EarthLink common stock.

As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, Windstream will cause the exchange agent to send a letter of transmittal
specifying, among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates representing EarthLink shares
shall pass, upon proper delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent. The letter will also include instructions explaining the
procedure for surrendering EarthLink share certificates, if any, in exchange for shares of Windstream common stock and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Windstream common stock.

EarthLink stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Windstream common stock pursuant to the merger. Instead of any
fractional shares, each EarthLink stockholder who would otherwise receive a fractional share will receive, in exchange for such fractional
share, cash as provided in the merger agreement.

120



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

After the effective time of the subsequent merger, shares of EarthLink common stock will no longer be issued and outstanding, will be
canceled and will cease to exist, and each certificate, if any, that previously represented EarthLink common stock will represent only the
right to receive the merger consideration as described above. With respect to such shares of Windstream common stock deliverable upon
the surrender of EarthLink share certificates, until holders of such EarthLink share certificates have surrendered such stock certificates to
the exchange agent for exchange, those holders will not receive dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Windstream
common stock with a record date after the effective time of the merger.

Windstream stockholders need not take any action with respect to their stock certificates.

Treatment of Options to Purchase EarthLink Shares and EarthLink RSUs

Options

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase EarthLink common stock will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a number of shares of Windstream common stock equal to (i) the product of the number of shares of EarthLink common
stock underlying such option and the exchange ratio, less (ii) that number of shares of Windstream common stock equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such option with a fair market value (determined based on the closing
price of EarthLink common stock on the business day immediately prior to the closing of the merger) equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate
exercise price of such EarthLink option plus (y) any required federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding on such option and (B) the
exchange ratio, provided that any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same manner as any
resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration.

Restricted Stock Units

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding EarthLink restricted stock unit will be assumed by Windstream and converted into a
Windstream restricted stock unit with respect to that number of shares of Windstream common stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such EarthLink restricted stock unit by the exchange ratio, provided that any
resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same manner as any resulting fractional shares of
Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration. The other terms of the EarthLink restricted stock unit, including vesting,
shall continue to apply to the Windstream restricted stock unit.

Dividend Matters

EarthLink paid aggregate cash dividends in an amount equal to $0.20 per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013; EarthLink has paid cash dividends
of $0.05 per share per quarter in 2016 in the first three quarters, and it is intended that EarthLink will continue to pay such quarterly
amount, or $0.05 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Windstream paid aggregate cash dividends in an amount equal to $0.5763 per share in 2015 and $1.00 per share in each of 2014 and 2013;
Windstream has paid cash dividends of $0.15 per share per quarter in 2016 in the first three quarters, and it is intended that Windstream
will continue to pay such quarterly amount, or $0.15 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.

121



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 137/364

Each of Windstream and EarthLink agreed under the merger agreement that they will continue to pay their respective quarterly dividends
in accordance with past practice until the closing of the merger, provided that Windstream and EarthLink will coordinate to designate the
business day immediately prior to the closing of the merger as the record and payment dates for a pro-rata portion of their respective
quarterly dividends declared in the calendar quarter in which closing is to occur. After the closing of the mergers, all Windstream
stockholders (including former EarthLink stockholders and former holders of options to purchase EarthLink common stock who receive
Windstream common stock in the merger) will be entitled to receive Windstream’s regular quarterly dividend, pro-rated for the number of
days from the closing through such subsequent record date.

Listing of Windstream Common Stock

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that the shares of Windstream common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance.

Financing Related to the Mergers

Windstream Services, LLC, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Windstream Services) has been advised by J.P. Morgan that a syndicate of lenders has indicated that they are willing to provide up to $450
million aggregate principal amount of incremental term loans (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Incremental Loans) under Windstream Services’ existing senior secured credit facilities, the proceeds of which are expected to be used to
redeem, repurchase or discharge EarthLink’s existing third-party debt and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith.

The Incremental Loans are expected to be issued at a price of 99.0% of their principal amount. Interest on the Incremental Loans is
expected to accrue at either the London Interbank Offered Rate (which we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as LIBOR) plus
a margin of 4.00% per annum or, at the option of Windstream Services, at a base rate plus a margin of 3.00% per annum. LIBOR will be
subject to a 0.75% floor. The Incremental Loans will be subject to quarterly amortization in an aggregate amount of approximately 0.25%
of the initial principal amount of the loans, with the remaining balance payable on March 29, 2021. The Incremental Loans will be
repayable at any time, subject to soft call protection for the first six months following incurrence.

The closing of the Incremental Loans is expected to occur concurrently with the closing of the merger. If the merger has not closed by
March 15, 2017, it is expected that the Incremental Loans will be funded on March 15, 2017 and such proceeds at that time will be placed
into escrow pending the closing of the merger. The Incremental Loans are expected to be subject to a ticking fee beginning on or about
December 21, 2016 and ending on the funding date for the Incremental Loans.

It is expected that the closing with respect to the Incremental Loans will be subject to:

● consummation of the merger pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement;
 

● the redemption, repurchase or discharge in full of certain of EarthLink’s existing third-party debt;
 

● the payment of applicable fees that are due and payable on or prior to the closing of the Incremental Loans; and
 

● other customary closing conditions to be more fully set forth in the incremental amendment.

122



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

The closing of the merger is not subject to the closing of the Incremental Loans. There can be no assurance that Windstream Services will
successfully enter into definitive documentation with respect to the Incremental Loans on the terms described herein or at all.

De-Listing and Deregistration of EarthLink Shares

Upon completion of the mergers, the EarthLink common stock currently listed on the NASDAQ will cease to be listed on the NASDAQ
and be subsequently deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Appraisal Rights

Under the DGCL, neither Windstream stockholders nor EarthLink stockholders are entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in connection
with the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

123



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following section summarizes material provisions of the merger agreement, which is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex A and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The rights and obligations of Windstream and EarthLink are governed
by the express terms and conditions of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. Windstream and EarthLink stockholders are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety as
well as this joint proxy statement/prospectus before making any decisions regarding the mergers, including the approval of the merger
proposal, the Windstream stock issuance proposal and the Windstream charter amendment proposal, as applicable. This summary is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement.

The merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to provide you with information regarding its terms and is not
intended to provide any factual information about Windstream or EarthLink. The merger agreement contains representations and
warranties that the parties made to each other as of the date of the merger agreement or other specific dates, solely for purposes of the
contract between the parties, and those representations and warranties should not be relied upon by any other person. The assertions
embodied in those representations and warranties are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in
connection with negotiating the merger agreement. You should not rely upon the representations and warranties as accurate or complete or
characterizations of the actual state of facts as of any specified date since the representations and warranties:

● may not be intended to establish matters of fact, but rather to allocate the risk between the parties to the merger agreement in the
event the statements therein prove to be inaccurate;
 

● have been modified in important part by certain underlying disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with
the negotiation of the merger agreement, which are not reflected in the merger agreement itself or publicly filed; and
 

● such disclosures are subject to contractual standards of materiality different from what is generally applicable to you or other
investors.

Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should
be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 200.

The Mergers

The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Merger Sub 1 will merge
with and into EarthLink, with EarthLink continuing as the surviving corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream.
Immediately after the effective time of the merger, EarthLink will merge with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the
surviving company and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates

In the merger, each share of EarthLink common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other
than the cancelled shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock.

124



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

Windstream will not issue fractional shares of Windstream common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Instead, each EarthLink
stockholder who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Windstream common stock will receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price for a share of Windstream common stock on the NASDAQ on the business day immediately
preceding the closing of the merger.

The merger consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with respect to the
shares of Windstream common stock or shares of EarthLink common stock prior to the effective time of the merger.

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Windstream will appoint an exchange agent to handle the exchange of shares of EarthLink
common stock for shares of Windstream common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Windstream common stock. As
promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, Windstream will cause the exchange agent to send a letter of transmittal
specifying, among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates representing EarthLink shares
shall pass, upon proper delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent. The letter will also include instructions explaining the
procedure for surrendering EarthLink share certificates, if any, in exchange for shares of Windstream common stock and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Windstream common stock.

After the effective time of the subsequent merger, shares of EarthLink common stock will no longer be issued and outstanding, will be
canceled and will cease to exist, and each certificate, if any, that previously represented EarthLink common stock will represent only the
right to receive the merger consideration as described above. With respect to such shares of Windstream common stock deliverable upon
the surrender of EarthLink share certificates, until holders of such EarthLink share certificates have surrendered such stock certificates to
the exchange agent for exchange, those holders will not receive dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Windstream
common stock with a record date after the effective time of the merger.

Treatment of Equity-Based Grants

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase EarthLink common stock will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a number of shares of Windstream common stock equal to (i) the product of the number of shares of EarthLink common
stock underlying such option and the exchange ratio, less (ii) that number of shares of Windstream common stock equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such option with a fair market value (determined based on the closing
price of EarthLink common stock on the business day immediately prior to the closing of the merger) equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate
exercise price of such EarthLink option plus (y) any required federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding on such option and (B)the
exchange ratio, provided that any resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same manner as any
resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding EarthLink restricted stock unit will be assumed by Windstream and converted into a
Windstream restricted stock unit with respect to that number of shares of Windstream common stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of EarthLink common stock subject to such EarthLink restricted stock unit by the exchange ratio, provided that any
resulting fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be treated in the same manner as any resulting

fractional shares of Windstream common stock payable as merger consideration. The other terms of the EarthLink restricted stock unit,
including vesting, shall continue to apply to the Windstream restricted stock unit.

Completion of the Mergers

Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the mergers will take place on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable law) of the conditions to the closing of the mergers (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied

issuance and Windstream charter amendment, as applicable;
 

● the opinion of its financial advisors;
 

● its material contracts;
 

● communications regulatory matters;

● insurance;
 

● finders or brokers fees;
 

● swap agreements;
 

● real property, networks;
 

● its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and
 

● its non-reliance on any representations or warranties of the other party not expressly stated in the merger agreement.

In addition, Windstream made representations and warranties to EarthLink regarding Windstream’s availability of funds to consummate
the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payoff or discharge of EarthLink’s
outstanding indebtedness, and the absence of any financing condition to Windstream’s, Merger Sub 1’s and Merger Sub 2’s obligations
under the merger agreement.

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “materiality” or “material adverse effect” standard
(that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, would,
as the case may be, be material or have a material adverse effect). For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” on or
with respect to a person means any effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development or circumstance (any such item, a “circumstance”)
that is or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on or change in (A) the financial condition, properties,
business or results of operations of such person and all of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the ability of such person to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in the manner contemplated thereby prior to the termination date;
provided, however, that no circumstance caused by or resulting from any of the following shall constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a “material adverse effect” on or with respect to a person: (i)
changes or developments generally affecting the industries in which such person and its subsidiaries operate, including changes in the use,
adoption or non-adoption of technologies or industry standards, (ii) geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any
acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism threatened or underway as
of the date of the merger agreement, (iii) any change affecting the economy, credit or financial or capital markets, in the United States or
elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest or exchange rates, (iv) any change in such person’s stock price or trading volume or
any failure of such person to meet financial projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates, milestones, budgets or financial or operating
predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it being understood that the circumstances

giving rise to or contributing to such change in stock price or trading volume or such failure may (to the extent not otherwise falling within
any of the exceptions set forth in clauses (i) through (ix) of this definition) be deemed to constitute, and may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a material adverse effect), (v) the negotiation, announcement
or execution of the merger agreement or the pendency of the consummation of the mergers (other than for purposes of Section 3.3(b),
Section 3.3(c), Section 4.3(b) and Section 4.3(c) of the merger agreement, as applicable), including the impact thereof on relationships of
such person and its subsidiaries with their respective customers, suppliers, distributors, partners, employees or regulators, or any litigation
arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or violation of law relating to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, (vi) any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or GAAP or any interpretation thereof after the date of the merger
agreement, (vii) any hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster, (viii) the performance of or compliance with the
express terms of the merger agreement, the taking of any action that is expressly contemplated or required by the merger agreement to be
taken by the person taking such action, the failure to take any action that is prohibited by the merger agreement to be taken by the person
failing to take such action, the taking of any action by EarthLink with Windstream’s written consent or at Windstream’s written request,
the taking of any action by Windstream with EarthLink’s written consent or at EarthLink’s written request or the taking of any action that
is identified in Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (other than for purposes of Section 3.3(b), Section 3.3(c), Section 4.3(b)
and Section 4.3(c) of the merger agreement, as applicable), or (ix) any change or prospective change in such person’s credit ratings, unless
(it being understood that the circumstances giving rise to or contributing to such change in credit ratings may be deemed to constitute, and
may (to the extent not otherwise falling within any of the exceptions set forth in clauses (i) through (ix) of this definition) be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a material adverse effect), in the case of clauses (i),
(ii), (iii), (vi) or (vii) above, such circumstance has had or would reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate adverse impact on the
financial condition, properties, business or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other
persons operating in the industries in which such person and its subsidiaries operate (in which case the incremental disproportionate
impact or impacts may be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a material
adverse effect).

As described directly under “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 124 above, the parties to the merger agreement made the
representations and warranties contained therein solely for purposes of the contract between the parties, and those representations and
warranties are intended to be and should not be relied upon by any other person. Further, the assertions embodied in those representations
and warranties are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the merger
agreement, and you should not rely upon the representations and warranties as accurate or complete or characterizations of the actual state
of facts as of any specified date.

Conduct of Business

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed to certain covenants in the merger agreement restricting the conduct of its business between

contemplated or required by the merger agreement or as set forth in the parties’ respective disclosure letters. In general, EarthLink has
agreed, except to the extent reasonably necessary to achieve targets set forth in the financial plan of EarthLink and its subsidiaries for
fiscal years 2016 and 2017, to (i) conduct in all material respects its and its subsidiaries’ business in the ordinary course of business

Tax Free Reorganization Treatment

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed that the mergers are intended to be treated as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as
a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither EarthLink nor Windstream may, nor may they permit any of
their respective subsidiaries to, take any action, or cause any action to be taken, that would result in the mergers failing to qualify as tax-
free under Section 368(a). EarthLink and Windstream have both agreed to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the mergers to qualify as a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code, including the providing representation letters to each of
EarthLink’s and Windstream’s respective tax counsel substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D to the Merger Agreement.

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed to report the Combination as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code on its
United States federal income tax return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code.

Access to Information; Confidentiality

EarthLink has agreed to afford to Windstream, Windstream’s officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors and agents and other representatives reasonable access to EarthLink’s and its subsidiaries properties, contracts, commitments,
books and records.

EarthLink will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, (i) furnish promptly to Windstream a copy of any document filed or received by it
pursuant to federal and state law and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to furnish promptly to Windstream such
additional financial and operating data and other information as Windstream may reasonably request, except for any information that:

● EarthLink determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to cause a violation of any contract to which
EarthLink is a party (provided that EarthLink must use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of the necessary
party to such access or disclosure);
 

● EarthLink determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to cause a risk of loss of attorney-client privilege to
EarthLink (provided that EarthLink must use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as
possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of any attorney-client privilege);
 

● relates to the negotiation and execution of the merger agreement or any alternative transaction proposal;

● EarthLink determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to expose EarthLink to risk of liability for disclosure
of sensitive or personal information; or
 

● EarthLink determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of applicable laws.

Notwithstanding the above, Windstream may not conduct any activities pursuant to its above access to information rights in a manner that
interferes unreasonably with the business or operations of EarthLink.

Windstream has agreed to afford to EarthLink, EarthLink’s officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors
and agents and other representatives reasonable access to Windstream’s and its subsidiaries properties, contracts, commitments, books and
records.

Windstream will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, (i) furnish promptly to EarthLink a copy of any document filed or received by it
pursuant to federal and state law and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to furnish promptly to EarthLink such
additional financial and operating data and other information as EarthLink may reasonably request, except for any information that:

● Windstream determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to cause a violation of any contract to which
Windstream is a party (provided that Windstream must use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of the
necessary party to such access or disclosure);
 

● Windstream determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to cause a risk of loss of attorney-client privilege to
Windstream (provided that Windstream must use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it
as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of any attorney-client privilege);
 

● relates to the negotiation and execution of the merger agreement or any alternative transaction proposal;

● Windstream determines, in its reasonable judgment, would be reasonably likely to expose Windstream to risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information; or

interferes unreasonably with the business or operations of Windstream.

Each of EarthLink and Windstream agree to treat any information received pursuant to the merger agreement in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement between EarthLink and Windstream, dated as of October 3, 2016. Each of EarthLink and Windstream further
agree that the other party makes no representations or warranties to it regarding the accuracy of any information provided to it under its
access to information rights other than as expressly set forth in the representations and warranties provisions of the merger agreement.

EarthLink has agreed to cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by Windstream, in Windstream’s efforts to plan the integration
of the parties’ operations, including providing reports on operational matters and participating in such integration planning teams and
committees as Windstream may reasonably request.

No Solicitation of Alternative Transaction Proposals

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed that, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the closing of the merger and
the termination of the merger agreement (which we refer to as the no shop period), each of the parties and its respective subsidiaries will
not and will not instruct its affiliates and representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
any alternative transaction proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative transaction
proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any persons regarding, or furnish to any person non-public information
with respect to, or knowingly cooperate in any way with any person in connection with soliciting, initiating, facilitating or encouraging,
any alternative transaction proposal or the submission or making of any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an alternative transaction proposal.

During the no shop period, each of the parties has agreed, and instructed its affiliates and representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted with respect to any alternative transaction proposal or
any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative transaction proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access.

Prior to the time of the necessary stockholder approval, if a party receives an alternative transaction proposal, (i) the party and its
representatives may contact the person or group making the alternative transaction proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions of
the proposal or to request that any oral proposal be made in writing, and (ii) if the party’s board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that an alternative transaction proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a superior proposal, then the party and its representatives may:

● furnish information with respect to the party and its subsidiaries to the person or group making such alternative transaction
proposal (provided that all such information has been provided to the other party or is provided to the other party prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive on such person than the confidentiality agreement with Windstream or EarthLink, as applicable; and
 

● participate in discussions regarding the terms of such alternative transaction proposal and the negotiation of such terms with the
person or group making such alternative transaction proposal.

Each party has agreed that neither its board of directors nor any committee thereof may:

● (i) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the other party), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner
adverse to the other party), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the party’s board or any of its
committees of the matters to be approved at such party’s special meeting of stockholders, or (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any alternative transaction proposal; or
 

● allow the party or its subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding agreement in connection with any alternative transaction
proposal (other than a permitted confidentiality agreement).

Prior to the necessary stockholder approval, each party’s board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change and, in the case
of an alternative transaction proposal, terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an alternative
transaction proposal (i) if

139



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

the party’s board of directors determines that an alternative transaction proposal constitutes a superior proposal or (ii) in response to any
event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to the party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known
to, or reasonably foreseeable by, such party’s board of directors prior to the date of the merger agreement, subsequently becomes known to
such party’s board of directors and does not involve or relate to an alternative transaction proposal if, in either case, the party’s board of
directors determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. Neither
party will be entitled to exercise its right to make an adverse recommendation change or, in the case of an alternative transaction proposal
which constitutes a superior proposal, terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the superior
proposal, unless (i) the party has given the other party at least three (3) business says’ prior written notice that the party’s board of
directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons, including, in the case of a superior proposal, the material terms of any
superior proposal, (ii) during such a period, the party has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, with the other party in
good faith, to the extent the other party desires to negotiate, to enable the other party to propose in writing a binding offer to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that, if applicable, the alternative transaction proposal ceases to
constitute a superior proposal or, in connection with a change in recommendation not involving or relating to an alternative transaction
proposal, would cause the party’s board of directors no longer to believe that the failure to make a recommendation change would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, and (iii) at the end of such period, the party’s board of directors must have
considered in good faith such binding offer and determined that the superior proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal or, other
than in the case of an alternative transaction proposal, that it would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the party’s
board of directors’ fiduciary duties if it failed to make an adverse recommendation change.

The above does not prohibit the party from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making “stop-look-and-listen” communications under Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the party if, in the good faith judgment of the party’s board of directors (after consultation
with its outside counsel), failure to disclose such information would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law.

An “alternative transaction proposal” for Windstream means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) by a third party or group
relating to any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in any: (i) merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, share
exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving Windstream (A) pursuant to which any person (or the stockholders
of any person) or group, other than the stockholders of Windstream (as a group) immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction, would hold Windstream common stock representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the surviving or
resulting entity after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction or (B) as a result of which the stockholders of Windstream (as a
group) immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction would hold Windstream common stock representing less than eighty-
five percent (85%) of the voting power of the surviving or resulting entity after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction, (ii)
sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a subsidiary of
Windstream or otherwise), of any business or assets of Windstream or the subsidiaries of Windstream representing fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Windstream and the subsidiaries of Windstream, taken as a whole, (iii)

A “superior proposal” for Windstream means any bona fide written alternative transaction proposal made by a third party or group (i) on

such proposal and the merger agreement (including any changes proposed by EarthLink to the terms of the merger agreement), and (ii) that
the Windstream Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) would reasonably be
expected to be completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including the financing

alternative transaction proposal in this definition of superior proposal for Windstream, all references to “fifteen percent (15%)” and

percent (50%).”

contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, share

Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders’ Meetings

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed to jointly prepare and file with the SEC the joint proxy statement, and Windstream will
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4. The parties have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments from the

As promptly as practicable following the Form S-4 being declared effective, each party has agreed to take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable laws and their respective organizational documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the Form S-4 has been declared

Without the prior written consent of EarthLink, Windstream may only propose to its stockholders at the stockholders meeting the
following: (i) the approval of the Windstream charter amendment; (ii) the approval of the Windstream stock issuance; and (iii) if

stock issuable in the merger and use all reasonable best efforts to obtain approval for the listing of such common stock.

Windstream and EarthLink have agreed to (i) cooperate with each other in order to lift any injunctions or remove any other impediment to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) cooperate with each other in obtaining a written
opinion of each party’s respective legal counsel as to the qualification of the mergers as a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the
Code.

Employee Matters

EarthLink and Windstream have agreed that, from the effective time of the merger, Windstream will honor all EarthLink benefit plans, in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the date of the merger agreement, provided that nothing will be deemed to
limit or otherwise impair Windstream from amending or terminating any such benefit plans in accordance with their terms.

Windstream has agreed that, from the effective time of the merger and for twelve months thereafter, Windstream will ensure that each
employee of EarthLink or its subsidiaries who continues in employment with Windstream or its subsidiaries, and who is not subject to a
collective bargaining agreement, will receive a base salary or hourly wage rate no less than that provided by EarthLink and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. From the effective time of the merger to December 31, 2017, Windstream will
provide to each EarthLink employee a cash commission opportunity and target cash bonus opportunity each no less than provided by
EarthLink and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. From the effective time of the merger, Windstream
will cause the surviving company and its subsidiaries to provide welfare and employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (other
than with respect to non-cash incentive or severance) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Windstream and its subsidiaries. For a period beginning at the effective time of the merger and ending no less than
twelve months thereafter, Windstream will ensure that each EarthLink employee who is not a party to either an individual agreement
providing severance benefits or the change in control severance plan of EarthLink will receive severance benefits that are no less favorable
than those provided by EarthLink and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

Windstream and its affiliates will recognize the service of employees with EarthLink and its subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to
closing as service with Windstream for all purposes in connection with any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by
Windstream or one of its affiliates following the closing, except (i) for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii)
for purposes of any retiree welfare plan or (iii) as would result in a duplication of benefits.

Windstream and its affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations
as to pre-existing and at-work conditions under any group health plan that is made available to such employees after the effective time of
the merger, and (ii) provide credit to EarthLink employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
employees under any group health plan of EarthLink or its subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year following the effective
time of the merger.

Notification of Certain Matters

EarthLink must give prompt notice to Windstream, and Windstream must give prompt notice to EarthLink, of (i) the occurrence of any
event known to it which has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on it
or has caused, or would reasonably be expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, any condition to closing set forth in the merger
agreement to be unsatisfied at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, or (ii) any action,

EarthLink and Windstream will jointly and in cooperation with each other direct the parties’ proceedings before any governmental entity
with respect to the mergers, the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each of Windstream
and EarthLink agree to take, and Windstream is required to take, any and all steps, and to make any and all reasonable undertakings,
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any regulatory law that may be asserted by any third party or
governmental entity with respect to the mergers so as to enable the closing to occur, provided that neither party will be required to (i)
divest or dispose of any assets or businesses (or transfer to a trust or similar vehicle pending such divestiture) or (ii) undertake any efforts
or take any action if the taking of such efforts or action is or would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, business, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Windstream and its
subsidiaries (including the surviving company), taken as a whole, after giving effect to the mergers (it being understood that such material
adverse effect will be measured solely on a scale relative to Windstream and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the
mergers).

Indemnification and Insurance

Each of EarthLink and Windstream has agreed that all rights to indemnification and payment or reimbursement of fees and expenses
incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim related to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
merger will survive the mergers and will continue for a period of six (6) years after the effective time of the merger.

For a period of six (6) years after the effective time of the merger, Windstream will indemnify, among others, current and former directors
and officers of EarthLink to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses,
judgments, fines and, with Windstream’s prior consent, amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened or actual civil,
criminal or administrative action, suit, litigation, arbitration, mediation, claim, hearing, inquiry investigation or other proceeding to which
an indemnified party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to:

● the fact that such individual is or was a director or officer of EarthLink or any of its subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request
of EarthLink or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person; or
 

● (ii) the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, whether asserted or arising before or after the effective
time of the merger.

The merger agreement requires Windstream to cause the surviving company to maintain for a period of six (6) years after completion of
the mergers directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
merger, covering each person covered by EarthLink’s currently in force directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, provided that if
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance exceeds three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium for such insurance as of the
date of the merger agreement, then the surviving company or Windstream must obtain a policy covering such individuals with the greatest
coverage then available, but not in excess of such three hundred percent (300%) amount. EarthLink may, in consultation with Windstream
and in lieu of the policy in the previous sentence, purchase a six year pre-paid “tail policy” prior to closing on terms providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits in the aggregate to such directors and officers as its current policy at an aggregate cost up to but not
exceeding the aggregate maximum payable pursuant to the preceding sentence for such six-year prior.

Section 16 Matters

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Windstream and EarthLink must use reasonable best efforts to approve in advance in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act any dispositions of EarthLink common stock or acquisitions of
Windstream common stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by each respective officer or director of
EarthLink who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

Control of Operations

Windstream and EarthLink agree that nothing contained in the merger agreement gives either party, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the other party’s operations prior to the effective time of the merger.

Windstream Board; Governance Matters

Prior to the closing, Windstream will increase the size of its board of directors to twelve members and, effective as of the effective time of
the merger, will appoint three members of the EarthLink Board selected by EarthLink to the Windstream Board. The EarthLink designees
must be reasonably acceptable to Windstream, taking into account Windstream’s normal corporate governance process for selection of
directors to the Windstream Board.

The EarthLink designees will serve until Windstream’s next annual meeting of stockholders, and Windstream must re-nominate the
EarthLink designees for election to the Windstream Board at the first annual meeting immediately following the closing of the mergers
and solicit proxies in favor of their election using efforts no less than the efforts used to solicit proxies in favor of the election of the other
individuals nominated to the Windstream Board.

Dividend Matters

EarthLink and Windstream will coordinate with each other to designate the same record and payment dates for their respective quarterly
dividends declared in any calendar quarter in which the closing might reasonably be expected to occur. However, EarthLink and
Windstream must designate the business day immediately prior to the closing date as the record and payment date for each such party’s
final quarterly dividend, which will be in an amount equal to each party’s respective regular quarterly cash dividend, pro-rated based on
the number of days elapsed in such calendar quarter up to such record date. After the closing date, all holders of Windstream common
stock (including former holders of EarthLink common stock and EarthLink options) will be entitled to receive with respect to each share
of Windstream common stock, as and when declared by the Windstream Board, on the next record date for payment of dividends with
respect to Windstream common stock, Windstream’s regular quarterly cash dividend in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, pro-
rated based on the number of days from the closing date through such subsequent record date.

Financing Efforts and Related Cooperation

Windstream has agreed to keep EarthLink reasonably and promptly informed on the status of material developments in respect of any
financing contemplated by the merger agreement in connection with the mergers.

Each of Windstream, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 has acknowledged and agreed that the obtaining of any financing is not a condition
to the closing of the mergers.

146



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 162/364

Prior to the effective time of the merger, EarthLink will provide (and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees, consultants, advisors, counsel, accountants, auditors and other representatives to provide) such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Windstream with respect to any financing of the mergers and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
subject to certain limitations, including, among other things, that EarthLink, its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, advisors, accountants, consultants, auditors, agents and other representatives will not be required to take any action
that would unreasonably interfere with the business of EarthLink and its subsidiaries or that would violate any material agreement of
EarthLink or any of its subsidiaries.

Windstream will promptly reimburse EarthLink and its subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by it and its subsidiaries in complying with the financing cooperation provisions of the merger agreement. Windstream will
indemnify EarthLink and its subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives, from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, interest, costs, expenses, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement,
suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with any financing, other than any claims arising (i) from fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or gross negligence of EarthLink, its subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and other representatives or (ii) as a result of information provided by EarthLink, its subsidiaries or their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and other representatives to Windstream specifically to be used in connection with the financing being
materially misleading or materially incorrect.

Subject to certain limited exceptions, EarthLink and its subsidiaries have agreed to consent to the use of their logos in connection with any
financing.

Prior to or at closing, EarthLink must deliver an executed payoff letter in customary form for its Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2016 (which we refer to as the EarthLink credit agreement). Windstream and its subsidiaries are required
to provide the funds necessary for the payment in full of the EarthLink credit agreement and any other amounts payable under such payoff
letter.

EarthLink has agreed that Windstream and its affiliates may share any information with respect to EarthLink and its subsidiaries with
financing sources in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with any financing. However, the recipients of such information
must agree to customary confidentiality arrangements, including “click through” confidentiality agreements and confidentiality provisions
contained in customary bank books and offering memoranda.

Treatment of Existing Indentures

Windstream will be permitted to commence debt tender offers and to conduct consent solicitations related to any or all of EarthLink’s
7.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 and/or 8.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the “existing notes”), on such terms and
conditions, that are acceptable to Windstream, and EarthLink will assist Windstream in connection with the above. Windstream will be
responsible for the payment of all existing notes validly tendered (and not withdrawn) and accepted by it for purchase in any connection
with any such debt tender offer.

EarthLink will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ respective
representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Windstream in connection with any debt tender offers and/or consent
solicitations. The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the debt
tender offer and/or consent solicitation will be selected by Windstream.

If requested by Windstream, in lieu of Windstream commencing a debt tender offer for any portion of any series of existing notes,
EarthLink must use its reasonable best efforts to (i) substantially simultaneously with the closing, issue a notice of optional redemption for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of existing notes, pursuant to the applicable existing indenture, and (ii)
take any other actions at and after the effective time reasonably requested by Windstream to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of such
existing notes and the release of any liens in connection therewith. However, substantially simultaneously to EarthLink’s being required to
issue such notice of optional redemption, Windstream will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the trustee under the applicable
existing indenture sufficient funds for such redemption, satisfaction and discharge.

Windstream will prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with any debt tender offer (including any related
consent solicitation) and/or satisfaction and discharge, and EarthLink will have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, (i) no personal liability will be imposed on the respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, advisors, accountants, consultants, auditors, agents or other representatives of EarthLink and its
subsidiaries, (ii) EarthLink and its subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, advisors, accountants,
consultants, auditors, agents and other representatives will not be required to take any action that, among other things, would unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the business of EarthLink and its subsidiaries or conflict with any material agreement of EarthLink or any of
its subsidiaries, (iii) neither EarthLink nor its subsidiaries will be required to pay any fees or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with any offer to purchase, debt tender offer, consent solicitation or satisfaction and discharge, (iv) Windstream will not acquire
any of the existing notes prior to closing and (v) any legal opinions in connection with the above will be delivered by counsel to
Windstream.

Windstream has agreed to promptly reimburse EarthLink for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid to third
parties in connection with any offer to purchase, debt tender offer, consent solicitation or satisfaction and discharge. Windstream will
indemnify EarthLink and its subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, employees and other representatives, from and against any
and all liabilities or losses, damages, claims, interest, costs, expenses, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement,
suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with any offer to purchase, debt tender offer, consent solicitation or satisfaction
and discharge and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than arising from information provided in writing by EarthLink
or on behalf of EarthLink by its representatives expressly for use in connection with the foregoing), except in the event such loss, damage
or other amount is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or gross negligence of EarthLink, its subsidiaries or their respective representatives.

Windstream Charter Amendment

Prior to the effective time of the merger, and subject to obtaining the approval of Windstream’s stockholders, Windstream is required to
file the Windstream charter amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Holding Company Formation

EarthLink and Windstream must cooperate in good faith with each other in connection with analyzing the advisability of, prior to the
effective time of the merger, EarthLink incorporating or causing to be incorporated a new Delaware corporation as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of EarthLink Business

Holdings, LLC and contributing or causing to be contributed to such corporation all of the stock and other ownership interests in
EarthLink’s subsidiaries held by EarthLink Business Holdings, LLC. Any such reorganization will be in the sole discretion of EarthLink.

Windstream Rights Agreement

Windstream agrees not to amend the Windstream rights agreement in any way that alters any of the provisions of the amendment to the
Windstream rights agreement that Windstream adopted in connection with its entry into the merger agreement.

Availability of Funds

From the date of the merger agreement until the effect time of the merger, Windstream must at all times maintain available funds necessary
to consummate the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, taking into account (i) unrestricted cash, (ii)
availability under the Windstream credit agreement, (iii) the proceeds of any subsequent borrowings or of any other financing permitted by
the merger agreement and incurred for the primary purpose of consummating the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, and (iv) any commitment letter issued by a financing source for the primary purpose of providing funds to finance the
mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to EarthLink. Upon

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders (as defined
below) of EarthLink common stock that receive Windstream common stock pursuant to the mergers. The discussion is limited to U.S.
holders who hold their EarthLink common stock as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property
held for investment). This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial
interpretations thereof and administrative rulings and published position of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the IRS),
each as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect,
and any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.

This discussion is for general information only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be
relevant to particular holders of EarthLink common stock in light of their particular facts and circumstances and does not apply to holders
of EarthLink common stock that are subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, banks or other
financial institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting,
insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other
flow-through entities (and investors therein), subchapter S corporations, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-
deferred accounts, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holder liable for the alternative minimum tax, certain
former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, holder that are not U.S. holders, U.S. holders having a “functional
currency” other than the U.S. dollar, holders who hold shares of EarthLink common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,
conversion transaction or other integrated transaction, and holders who acquire (or will acquire) their shares of EarthLink common stock
through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan). This discussion
does not address any considerations under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the income tax, nor does it address any
considerations under the 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on unearned income or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of EarthLink common stock, the tax
treatment of a person treated as a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Persons that for U.S. federal income tax purposes are treated as a partner in a partnership holding shares of EarthLink
common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the mergers to them.

ALL HOLDERS OF EARTHLINK COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGERS, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT
OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means any beneficial owner of shares of EarthLink common stock that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:

● an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

● a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

● an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

● a trust (a) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

General

EarthLink and Windstream intend for the mergers to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a
condition to Windstream’s obligation to complete the mergers that Windstream receive an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP, counsel to Windstream, to the effect that the mergers will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. It is a condition to EarthLink’s obligation to complete the mergers that EarthLink receive an opinion from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison LLP, counsel to EarthLink, to the effect that the mergers will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. These conditions may not be waived by EarthLink or Windstream after receipt of the approval of the mergers
by the stockholders of EarthLink and Windstream, respectively, without further stockholder approval.

These opinions will be based on customary assumptions and representations from EarthLink, Windstream, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2, as well as certain covenants and undertakings by EarthLink, Windstream, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2. EarthLink has received an
opinion of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP that, based on such assumptions, representations, covenants and undertakings,
and assuming that they remain true and accurate as of the effective time of the mergers, and that there is no change in applicable law, the
mergers will qualify under current U.S. federal income tax law as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code and,
accordingly, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of EarthLink common stock are as described below
under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the mergers to U.S. Holders.” In addition, Windstream has received an opinion of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP that, based on such assumptions, representations, covenants and undertakings, and assuming
that they remain true and accurate as of the effective time of the mergers, and that there is no change in applicable law, the mergers will
qualify under current U.S. federal income tax law as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code and, accordingly,
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of EarthLink common stock are as described below under “U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the mergers to U.S. Holders.” If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings
is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the opinions described above may be affected and the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the mergers could differ materially from those described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

An opinion of counsel represents counsel’s legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or any court, so there can be no certainty that the
IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. Neither EarthLink nor
Windstream intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the mergers. If the IRS were to successfully
challenge the “reorganization” status of the mergers, the tax consequences would be different from those set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to U.S. Holders

On the basis of the opinions described above, and subject to the discussion below relating to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares:

● a U.S. holder of EarthLink common stock will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of shares of EarthLink
common stock for shares of Windstream common stock in the mergers;
 

● a U.S. holder of EarthLink common stock will have a tax basis in the Windstream common stock received in the mergers
(including any fractional shares of Windstream common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash as described below)
equal to the tax basis of the EarthLink common stock surrendered in exchange therefor;
 

● a U.S. holder of EarthLink common stock will have a holding period for shares of Windstream common stock received in the
mergers (including any fractional shares of Windstream common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash as described
below) that includes its holding period for its shares of EarthLink common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.

Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares

No fractional shares of Windstream common stock will be distributed to holders of EarthLink common stock in connection with the
mergers. A U.S. holder that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Windstream common stock as part of the mergers will generally
be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the mergers and then as having sold that fractional share of Windstream
common stock for cash. As a result, such U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the cash
received for such fractional share and the portion of the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the shares of EarthLink common stock allocable to the
fractional share. Such capital gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such shares of EarthLink
common stock is more than one year. Long-term capital gain of certain non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals, is generally taxed
at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Backup Withholding

Backup withholding at the applicable rate (currently 28%) may apply with respect to certain payments, such as cash received for fractional
shares, unless the U.S. holder of the EarthLink common stock receiving such payments (i) is an exempt holder (and that, when required,
provides certification as to its exempt status) or (ii) provides a properly completed IRS Form W-9 containing the holder’s name, address,
correct federal taxpayer identification number and a statement that the holder is exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a
refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

Windstream prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method of
accounting. Windstream will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of EarthLink’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at the
acquisition date, with the excess purchase price being recorded as goodwill. Under GAAP, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
impairment at least annually.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presents the combination of historical financial statements of
Windstream and EarthLink adjusted to give effect to the mergers. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations assume the
mergers had been completed on January 1, 2015, while the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet assumes the mergers had been
completed on September 30, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based upon the historical financial statements of Windstream and
EarthLink and have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The pro forma condensed combined financial
statements are based on various assumptions, including assumptions relating to the consideration paid and the allocation thereof to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed from EarthLink based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The pro forma assumptions and
adjustments are described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Pro forma
adjustments are those that are directly attributable to the transaction, are factually supportable and, with respect to the unaudited pro forma
statement of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any incremental costs incurred in integrating the two companies or any
cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that could result from the mergers.

The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for informational purposes. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Windstream has not completed the appraisals necessary to arrive at the fair market value of the assets and liabilities
to be acquired and the related allocations of purchase price. Once Windstream has completed the appraisals necessary to finalize the
required purchase price allocation after the consummation of the mergers, the final allocation of purchase price will be determined. The
final purchase price allocation will be determined by management with the assistance of third party appraisals and may be different than
that reflected in the pro forma purchase price allocation reflected in the accompanying pro forma financial statements and this difference
may be material.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not intended to represent and are not necessarily indicative of what
the combined company’s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the mergers been completed on January 1, 2015
or September 30, 2016, as the case may be. In addition, the pro forma financial statements do not purport to project the future financial
condition and results of operations of the combined company. The accompanying notes are an integral part of the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements and should be read in conjunction therewith.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes included in Windstream’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, as well as EarthLink’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30,
2016, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and were
based on the historical audited financial statements of Windstream and EarthLink for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the unaudited
financial statements of Windstream and EarthLink as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Certain reclassifications have
been made to the historical financial statements of EarthLink to conform to Windstream’s presentation.

Windstream has been determined to be the acquirer under the acquisition method of accounting based on various considerations. Upon
closing of the mergers, Windstream stockholders are expected to own approximately 51% of the combined company and EarthLink
stockholders are expected to own approximately 49%. Additionally, Windstream will issue common stock and transfer cash in lieu of
fractional shares as consideration to EarthLink stockholders after giving effect to the exchange ratio. Further, the Board of Directors and
senior management of the combined company will be comprised primarily of current Windstream board members and senior management,
respectively.

Windstream has performed a preliminary review of EarthLink’s accounting policies based on publicly available information and
discussions with EarthLink management to determine whether any adjustments were necessary to ensure the comparability in the pro
forma combined financial statements. Except for changing EarthLink’s reporting of Universal Service Fund (which we refer to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as USF) fees billed to customers and the related payments from a net basis to a gross basis to conform to
Windstream’s reporting of such customer billings, Windstream is not aware of any other differences, at this time, that would have a
material impact on the pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements do not reflect any other adjustments to conform the accounting policies of the two companies. Upon completion of the
mergers, Windstream will perform a more detailed review of EarthLink’s accounting policies. As a result of that review, differences in
accounting policies may be identified that, when conformed, could have a material impact on Windstream’s consolidated financial
statements for periods subsequent to the mergers.

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

Windstream will allocate the purchase price paid to the fair value of EarthLink’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimated
purchase price allocation presented below has been developed based on preliminary estimates of fair value using the historical financial
statements of EarthLink as of September 30, 2016. The allocation of the purchase price to acquired intangible assets is based on
preliminary fair value estimates and is subject to final management analysis, with the assistance of a third party valuation advisor, at the
completion of the mergers. Once Windstream and its third party valuation advisor have fully analyzed the specifics of EarthLink’s
intangible assets, additional insight will be gained that could impact: (i) the estimated total value assigned to intangible assets, (ii) the
estimated allocation of value between finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or (iii) the estimated weighted-average useful
life of each category of intangible assets. The following represents the estimated purchase price allocation as of September 30, 2016:

Value of Windstream common stock to be issued to EarthLink stockholders (1) $ 674.9
Value of Windstream restricted stock units issued to holders of EarthLink restricted stock

       Total consideration 697.6
Allocated to:
       Current assets (153.4)

       Intangible assets (4) (330.0)
       Other noncurrent assets (9.2)
       Current liabilities 149.0
       Long-term debt (5) 449.8
       Deferred income taxes (6) 123.3
       Other noncurrent liabilities 36.4
       Goodwill (7) $     630.0

(1) Equals the number of outstanding shares of common stock of EarthLink as of September 30, 2016 multiplied by the exchange ratio

of 0.818 multiplied by the Windstream closing price of Windstream common stock on January 5, 2017 of $7.82 per share.
       

The portion of the purchase price to be paid in shares of Windstream common stock will be valued based on the number of shares of
EarthLink common stock outstanding immediately prior to the mergers and the Windstream stock price on that date. A 10%
difference in Windstream’s stock price would change the purchase price by approximately $67.3 million with a corresponding change
to goodwill. Additionally, a 10% change in the number of shares of EarthLink common stock outstanding would change the purchase
price by approximately $68.0 million, with a corresponding change to goodwill. The actual purchase price will fluctuate with the
price of Windstream’s common stock until the effective date of the mergers and the final valuation could differ significantly from the
current estimate reflected in the table above.
 

(2) In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of replacement awards attributable to pre-combination service is
recorded as part of the consideration transferred in the mergers, while the fair value of replacement awards attributable to post-
combination service is recorded separately from the business combination and recognized as compensation cost in the post-
acquisition period over the remaining service period. The portion of EarthLink restricted stock units attributable to pre-combination
and post-combination service is estimated based on the ratio of vested to unvested EarthLink restricted stock units and the average
vesting period. These post-combination compensation costs have been recorded as adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See
Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments (I) for the applicable adjustment amounts. Various estimates were used in this calculation,
including average remaining vesting period. These estimates could differ significantly from actual amounts calculated at the date of
the mergers, and such differences could have a material impact on the total purchase price and the amount of recorded goodwill.
 

(3) Based on the preliminary fair value assessment, the carrying value of EarthLink’s property and equipment at September 30, 2016
approximates fair value. As such, the carrying value of EarthLink’s property and equipment was used in the preliminary purchase
price allocation, and no adjustments were made to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. Once the mergers are
completed and additional detailed information regarding EarthLink’s property and equipment is obtained, an adjustment to the
carrying value of EarthLink’s property and equipment may be required. Accordingly, the actual amount recorded when the mergers
are completed may differ

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 179/364

materially from the current net book value of EarthLink’s property and equipment. A 10% change in the amount allocated to property
and equipment would increase or decrease annual depreciation expense by $4.9 million.
 

(4) The identifiable intangibles consisted of (1) value assigned to the EarthLink’s customer base of $320.0 million and (2) value assigned
to the EarthLink trade name of $10.0 million. For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
operations, Windstream expects to amortize the fair value of the customer base using the sum-of-the-years amortization method over
its respective average estimated life of six years and to amortize the trade name on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life
of two years, which is consistent with the estimated expected benefit period of the acquired intangible assets. The preliminary
allocation of value to the intangible assets was based on assumptions as to the fair value of customers and trade name. These values
were determined using a market approach, which seeks to measure the fair value of assets as compared to similar transactions in the
marketplace. To determine market values, Windstream utilized a third party valuation firm to derive current market values for the
customer base and trade name from publicly available data for similar transactions in the telecommunications industry. As such, these
valuations are preliminary and do not necessarily represent the ultimate fair value of such assets that will be determined based on
third party appraisals subsequent to consummation of the mergers. A 10% change in the amount allocated to identifiable intangible
assets would increase or decrease annual amortization expense by $9.6 million.

 
       In addition, other intangible assets may be identified in the process of completing the third party appraisals that may be material to

the overall purchase price allocation.
 
(5) The fair values of EarthLink’s senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings were estimated based on observable

relevant market information. Additionally, deferred financing fees and unamortized discount of $6.4 million relating to EarthLink’s
long-term debt has been eliminated in connection with the adjustment of EarthLink’s long-term debt to fair value.

 
In December 2016, Windstream Services incurred $150 million in incremental term loans that were used to pay down amounts
outstanding under its revolving line of credit under its existing senior secured credit facilities and to pay fees and expenses related
thereto. Windstream Services has also been advised by JPMorgan that a syndicate of lenders has indicated that they are willing to
provide up to an additional $450 million aggregate principal amount of Incremental Loans. The Incremental Loans are expected to be
issued at a price of 99.0% of the principal amount of the loan. Interest on the Incremental Loans will accrue at either LIBOR plus a
margin of 4.00% per annum or, at the option of Windstream Services, at a base rate plus a margin of 3.00% per annum. LIBOR will
be subject to a 0.75% floor. The Incremental Loans will be subject to quarterly amortization in an aggregate amount of approximately
0.25% of the initial principal amount of the loans, with the remaining balance payable on March 29, 2021.

 
The $450.0 million of Incremental Loans proceeds will be used to redeem, repurchase or discharge all or a portion of EarthLink’s
senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. In connection with the refinancing, Windstream expects to incur
prepayment penalties and other expenses totaling approximately $23.8 million and incur debt issuance costs of $12.4 million, which
will be amortized as interest expense over the term of the new debt.

 
In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the total merger, prepayment penalties and other expenses of $55.8 million are
expensed as incurred. These costs have not been included as an adjustment to the pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations due to their non-recurring nature but have been recorded in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of
September 30, 2016. Because these costs may not be deductible for income tax purposes, no related income tax adjustment has been
made in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.

8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

The effects on interest expense resulting from the refinancing activities discussed above have been included as adjustments to the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. See Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments (K) for the applicable adjustment amounts.
 

(6) Deferred income taxes include EarthLink’s net noncurrent deferred income taxes of $4.4 million as of September 30, 2016 plus an
adjustment of $127.7 million to increase deferred income tax liabilities due to recording of new identifiable intangible assets for the
combined company. This amount was offset by an adjustment of $8.8 million related to the portion of replacement restricted stock
units allocated to the preliminary purchase price. The income tax adjustments were calculated using Windstream’s estimated statutory
tax rate of 38.7%. Upon completion of the mergers, the actual amounts recorded for deferred taxes may differ materially from the pro
forma amounts presented herein.

       
(7) Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated purchase price of the acquired business over the fair value of the underlying

identifiable net tangible and intangible assets at September 30, 2016. The premium paid by Windstream in this transaction reflects the
strategic importance of the mergers to Windstream. Upon completion of the mergers, Windstream will have increased operating scale
and scope giving it the ability to offer customers expanded products, services and enhanced enterprise solutions. The mergers will
result in Windstream having an extensive national footprint spanning approximately 145,000 fiber route miles and provide advanced
network connectivity, managed services, voice, internet and other value-added services. Windstream also expects to achieve
operating and capital expense synergies in completing the mergers. Goodwill recorded in this transaction will not be deductible for
income tax purposes.

Pro Forma Adjustments - Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform EarthLink’s historical amounts to Windstream’s financial statement presentation.
These reclassifications consisted of the following:

● EarthLink’s prepaid assets of $14.9 million as of September 30, 2016 were reclassified as other current assets. 
 

● EarthLink’s accrued payroll and related expenses of $22.4 million, other accrued liabilities of $65.4 million and deferred revenue
of $37.1 million as of September 30, 2016 were reclassified as other current liabilities. 
 

● EarthLink’s current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $4.4 million was reclassified as $2.3 million of
current maturities of long-term debt and $2.1 million of other current liabilities. 
 

● EarthLink’s long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $438.1 million was reclassified as $427.2 million of long-term debt and
$10.9 million of other liabilities.

(A) The pro forma adjustments to goodwill consist of the following:

(Millions)
Purchase price allocated to goodwill (see Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation above) $ 630.0
Eliminate EarthLink pre-merger goodwill      (141.9)
Net increase in goodwill $ 488.1

(B) The pro forma adjustments to other intangibles, net consist of the following:

(Millions)
Value assigned to intangible assets acquired (see Preliminary Purchase Price
       Allocation above) $ 330.0
Eliminate EarthLink pre-merger identified intangible assets (3.3)
Net increase in other intangible assets, net $     326.7

Based on the preliminary valuation, intangible assets acquired consist of $320.0 million in customer base and $10.0 million in trade
name.
 

(C) This adjustment is to eliminate EarthLink’s pre-merger deferred financing costs related to its senior secured credit facility.
 

(D) The pro forma adjustments to current maturities of long-term debt consist of the following:

(Millions)
Repayment of EarthLink’s current maturities of long-term debt upon the closing of the mergers $ (2.3)
Reclassify current portion of Windstream Services’ new incremental term loans 6.0
Net increase in current maturities of long-term debt $        3.7

(E) The pro forma adjustments to long-term debt consist of the following:

(Millions)
Proceeds of Windstream Services’ new incremental term loans $ 594.0
Debt issuance costs related to Windstream Services’ new incremental term loans (12.4)
Fair value adjustment to EarthLink long-term debt 16.2
Eliminate EarthLink pre-merger deferred financing costs and unamortized debt
       discount 6.4
Repayment of EarthLink’s long-term debt upon closing of the mergers (449.8)
Repayment of a portion of Windstream Services’ revolving line of credit borrowings (73.7)
Reclassify current portion of Windstream Services’ new incremental term loans (6.0)
Net increase in long-term debt $     74.7

(F) The pro forma adjustments to deferred income taxes include an adjustment of $127.7 million to increase deferred income tax liabilities
due to recording of new identifiable intangible assets for the combined company. This amount was offset by an adjustment of $8.8
million related to the portion of replacement stock options and restricted stock units allocated to the preliminary purchase price. The
income tax adjustments were calculated using Windstream’s estimated statutory tax rate of 38.7%.
 

(G) The historical stockholders’ equity of EarthLink will be eliminated upon the completion of the mergers. Windstream’s stockholders’
equity will increase over the pre-merger amounts by the value of the common stock issued to EarthLink stockholders in connection
with the merger. Windstream expects to issue approximately $697.6 million of common stock as part of the merger consideration
using a stock price of $7.82 (the closing per share price of Windstream common stock on January 5, 2017). The number of shares of
Windstream common stock to be issued to EarthLink stockholders is estimated to be 86.3 million and the number of replacement
restricted stock units to be 6.7 million. The actual number of shares of Windstream common stock to be issued will be

Pro Forma Adjustments - Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations

To conform to Windstream’s financial statement presentation, amounts previously reported by EarthLink as “revenues” and “cost of
revenues” have been classified as “service revenues” and “cost of services” in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations. In addition, EarthLink’s restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs of $9.1 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was reclassified as $6.6 million of merger and integration costs and $2.5 million of restructuring costs. EarthLink’s
restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs of $19.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was reclassified as $9.5
million of merger and integration costs and $9.8 million of restructuring costs. Adjustments also have been included in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statements of operations to eliminate service revenues and cost of services from transactions between
Windstream and EarthLink and to conform EarthLink’s reporting of USF fees billed to customers to Windstream’s reporting. As
previously noted, Windstream has historically reported such billings to customers and the related payments on a gross basis while
EarthLink has reported these amounts on a net basis.

(H) The pro forma adjustments to service revenues and cost of services consist of the following:

Nine Months

September 30, December 31,
(Millions)      2016      2015

Eliminate the impact of transactions between Windstream and
       EarthLink (7.7) (9.0)
Net increase to service revenues and cost of services $ 16.9 $ 23.7

(I) This adjustment is to record the post-combination stock-based compensation expense attributable to the replacement restricted stock
units issued to EarthLink employees as of date of the mergers.

(J) This adjustment is to record the incremental amortization expense related to the customer base and trade name intangible assets
recorded as of the closing date of the mergers and consists of the following:

Nine Months
Ended Year Ended

September 30, December 31,
(Millions)      2016      2015
Record amortization of customer base and trade name
       intangible assets $ 60.9 $ 96.4
Eliminate amortization related to EarthLink’s pre-merger identified
       intangible assets (21.9) (66.2)
Net increase in depreciation and amortization expense $               39.0 $               30.2

Amortization of the customer base was computed using the sum-of-the-years amortization method over an estimated useful life of 6
years and amortization of the trade name was computed on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 2 years.
 

 As of the effective time of the mergers, identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value and could include
intangible assets that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best
use. For purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Windstream has assumed that all acquired
tangible and intangible assets will be used in a manner that represents the highest and best use of those assets.
 

(K) The pro forma adjustments to interest expense consist of the following:

(Millions)      

Nine Months

Amortization of debt issuance costs related to new incremental
       term loans (1.9) (2.5)
Eliminate interest on EarthLink’s long-term debt repaid in
       connection with the mergers 30.1 47.7
Eliminate interest related to the portion of Windstream Services’
       revolving line of credit borrowings repaid with proceeds from the
       new incremental term loans 1.4 1.8
Net decrease in interest expense $ 8.5 $ 18.6

Interest on Windstream Services’ new incremental term loans was calculated based on an interest rate of 4.75% (LIBOR floor of
0.75% plus 4.00%). A 1/8% change to the annual interest rate would change interest expense by approximately $0.8 million on an
annual basis.

 
(L) The pro forma adjustments to income (loss) before income taxes were tax effected using Windstream’s estimated statutory tax rate of

38.7%.
 
(M) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined basic and diluted loss per share calculations are based on the combined basic and

diluted weighted-average shares. The historical basic and diluted weighted average shares of EarthLink are assumed to be replaced by
shares of Windstream common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock per each share of
EarthLink common stock issued and outstanding.

DIRECTORS OF WINDSTREAM FOLLOWING THE MERGERS

Windstream has agreed prior to the closing of the mergers to increase the size of the Windstream Board to twelve members and, effective
as of the effective time of the merger, to appoint to the Windstream Board three members of the EarthLink Board, to be selected by
EarthLink and reasonably acceptable to Windstream, taking into account Windstream’s normal corporate governance process for selection
of directors to the Windstream Board.

The EarthLink designees will serve until the next annual meeting of Windstream stockholders. Windstream has agreed to nominate the
EarthLink designees for election to the Windstream Board at the first annual meeting immediately following the closing of the mergers
and solicit proxies in favor of their election using efforts no less than the efforts used to solicit proxies in favor of the election of the other
individuals nominated to the Windstream Board.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, EarthLink has not determined the identities of the EarthLink designees.

DESCRIPTION OF WINDSTREAM CAPITAL STOCK

The following summary description of Windstream common stock is qualified in its entirety by the DGCL and the Windstream charter. The
Windstream charter (including the certificate of amendment to the Windstream charter) are included as exhibits to Windstream’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K (where Windstream’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is incorporated by reference to
Windstream’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed August 30, 2013 and the certificate of amendment to Windstream’s Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation is incorporated by reference to Windstream’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed April 27, 2015), each of which
is on file with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 200 for information on how you can view these
filings.

General

Under the Windstream charter, the total authorized capital stock of Windstream consists of 33,333,333 shares of preferred stock, par value
$.0001 per share, and 166,666,667 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share.

Preferred Stock

The Windstream charter provides that preferred stock may be issued from time to time and in one or more series. The Windstream Board is
authorized to determine or alter the powers, preferences and rights (including voting rights), and the qualifications, limitations and
restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock, and within the limitations or restrictions stated in
any resolution or resolutions of the Windstream Board originally fixing the number of shares constituting any series of preferred stock, to
increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of any such series of preferred stock then outstanding) the number of shares of
any such series of preferred stock, and to fix the number of shares of any series of preferred stock. In the event that the number of shares of
any series of preferred stock is so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease will resume the status which such shares had prior to the
adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series of preferred stock subject to the requirements of applicable
law.

Common Stock

Under the Windstream charter, the holders of Windstream common stock have one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders, except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or the Windstream charter and subject to the rights of holders of any outstanding
preferred stock. Holders of the common stock will be entitled to receive dividends ratably, if any, as may be declared by the Windstream
Board out of legally available funds, subject to any preferential dividend rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Upon Windstream’s
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably Windstream’s net assets available after
the payment or provision for payment of all debts and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. The Windstream
common stock has no preemptive rights, no cumulative voting rights and no redemption, sinking fund or conversion provisions.

To the greatest extent permitted by applicable DGCL, the shares of common stock will be uncertificated, and transfer is reflected by book
entry.

All rights, preferences and privileges of holders of Windstream common stock stated in this summary are subject to the rights of holders of
shares of any series of preferred stock which Windstream may designate and issue in the future without further stockholder approval.

Anti-Takeover Effects of the DGCL and Windstream’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

The DGCL, the Windstream charter and the Windstream bylaws contain a number of provisions which could have the effect of
discouraging transactions that involve an actual or threatened change of control of Windstream. In addition, provisions of the Windstream
charter and the Windstream bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects and could delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or
takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider in his, her or its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium
over the market price of the shares held by Windstream’s stockholders.

Rights Agreement

On September 17, 2015, the Windstream Board adopted a rights plan intended to avoid an “ownership change” within the meaning of
Section 382 of the Code, and thereby preserve the current ability of Windstream to utilize certain net operating loss carryovers and other
tax benefits of Windstream and its subsidiaries. If Windstream experiences an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Code,
Windstream’s ability to fully utilize the tax benefits on an annual basis will be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the tax
benefits and such other benefits could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of those assets. The
rights agreement is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring “beneficial ownership” of 4.90% or more of the
“outstanding shares” of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Windstream, without the approval of the Windstream Board.

As part of the rights agreement, the Windstream Board authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding
share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 28, 2015. Each right entitles the holder to purchase
from Windstream a unit consisting of one ten thousandth of a share (a “unit”) of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001
per share, of Windstream at a purchase price of $32.00 per unit, subject to adjustment. Until a right is exercised, the holder will have no
separate rights as a stockholder of Windstream, including the right to vote or to receive dividends in respect of rights. The rights will
expire on the earliest of (i) 5:00 P.M. New York City time on September 17, 2018, (ii) the time at which the rights are redeemed or
exchanged pursuant to the rights agreement, (iii) the date on which the Windstream Board determines that the rights agreement is no
longer necessary for the preservation of material valuable tax benefits or is no longer in the best interest of Windstream and its
stockholders and (iv) the beginning of a taxable year to which the Windstream Board determines that no tax benefits may be carried
forward.

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Windstream effected an amendment to the rights agreement to provide that,
among other things, (i) neither EarthLink nor its controlled affiliates will be deemed an “Acquiring Person” thereunder, (ii) no holder of
EarthLink common stock, stock options or restricted stock units will be deemed a “Beneficial Owner” thereunder prior to the
consummation of the mergers, and (iii) neither a “Distribution Date” nor a “Stock Acquisition Date” thereunder will be deemed to have
occurred in connection with the mergers, in each case, solely as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of the merger agreement
or the consummation of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The amendment also provides that any person who
becomes a holder of 4.90% or more of Windstream common stock solely as a result of the mergers (or would become such upon the later
vesting of Windstream restricted stock units received at the effective time of the mergers in respect of EarthLink restricted stock units
assumed by Windstream pursuant to the merger agreement) will be deemed an existing holder (not triggering the rights under the rights
agreement), unless and until such person acquires any additional shares of Windstream common stock. Upon a termination of the merger
agreement prior to the consummation of the mergers, the amendment will terminate automatically and will have no force or effect.

The foregoing description of the rights agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the rights agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 of Windstream’s Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on September 18,
2015, the disclosures set forth on Windstream’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2016 and the full text of the amendment to the
rights agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to Windstream’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on
November 10, 2016, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Delaware Section 203

Section 203 of the DGCL restricts business combinations with certain interested stockholders (defined generally under the DGCL to
include persons who beneficially own or acquire 15% or more of a Delaware corporation’s voting stock and their affiliates and associates,
and hereinafter as a “Section 203 Interested Stockholder”). Section 203 prohibits business combination transactions between a publicly-
held Delaware corporation and any Section 203 Interested Stockholder for a period of three years after the time at which the Section 203
Interested Stockholder became an interested stockholder unless: (a) prior to the time that such entity became a Section 203 Interested
Stockholder, the corporation’s board of directors approved either the proposed business combination or the transaction which resulted in
the Section 203 Interested Stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (b) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in
the Section 203 Interested Stockholder becoming such an interested stockholder, the Section 203 Interested Stockholder owned at least
85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
number of shares outstanding those shares owned (1) by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) by employee stock plans in
which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a
tender or exchange offer; or (c) on or subsequent to the time that such entity became a Section 203 Interested Stockholder, the business
combination is approved by the corporation’s board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by
written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the Section 203 Interested
Stockholder.

Under certain circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person who is a Section 203 Interested Stockholder to effect various
business combinations with a corporation for a period of three years. The provisions of Section 203 are intended to encourage third parties
interested in acquiring Windstream to negotiate in advance with the Windstream Board. Section 203 also may make it more difficult to
accomplish transactions that stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.

Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations

The Windstream bylaws provide that in order for a stockholder to nominate any person for election as a director or propose business at a
meeting of stockholders, the stockholder must give timely notice to Windstream’s Secretary. To be timely:

● in the case of an annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at Windstream’s principal
executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting;
provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 25 days (or 30 days in the case of director
nominations) from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be received not later than the close of business on the
tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the meeting was made;
and

173



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102541/000120677417000177/earthlink3175924-defm14a.htm 190/364

● in the case of a special meeting at which directors are to be elected, a stockholder’s notice of nominations must be delivered to or
mailed and received at Windstream’s principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the
day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the meeting was made.

These provisions could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before a meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for
directors by limiting the window of time available to present such matters to Windstream for presentation at such meeting.

Calling a Special Meeting; Action by Written Consent of Stockholders

Under the DGCL, a special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Windstream Board or by any other person authorized to do so
in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The Windstream charter states that as long as any security of the company is registered under
Section 12 of the Exchange Act, special meetings of stockholders of Windstream may be called only by a resolution of the Windstream
Board.

The Windstream charter provides that as long as any security of Windstream is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, no
stockholder action may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

The inability of the stockholders of Windstream to take action by written consent or to call a special meeting could make it more difficult
for stockholders to initiate actions that are opposed by the Windstream Board. In addition, the inability of stockholders to call a special
meeting of stockholders could make it more difficult to change the Windstream Board and management.

Authorized but Unissued Shares

Windstream’s authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder
approval, subject to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635, which sets forth the circumstances under which an issuer is required to obtain approval
from its stockholders prior to an issuance of securities in connection with: (1) the acquisition of the stock or assets of another company; (2)
equity-based compensation of officers, directors, employees or consultants; (3) a change of control; and (4) private placements. In
connection with an acquisition of the stock or assets of another company, NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 would require stockholder approval
prior to the issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) equal to 20% or more of the
outstanding common stock or 20% or more of the voting power of the outstanding common stock before the issuance, or if any director,
officer or substantial stockholder of the issuing company has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater
interest) in the company or assets to be acquired or in the consideration to be paid in the transaction or series of related transactions and the
present or potential issuance of common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, could result in an increase
in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more.

These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital,
corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares could render it more difficult or
discourage an attempt to obtain control of Windstream by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. In addition, the
authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Windstream Board to issue preferred stock with voting or other
rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to effect a change of control of Windstream.

Supermajority Vote to Amend Charter and Bylaws

Under the DGCL, unless a higher vote is required in the certificate of incorporation of a corporation, an amendment to such certificate of
incorporation generally requires approval by the corporation’s board of directors and approval by a majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote on the proposed amendment. Notwithstanding any provision of a corporation’s certificate of incorporation to the contrary,
under the DGCL, holders of a class of a corporation’s stock are entitled to vote as a class on the approval of any amendment to the
corporation’s certificate of incorporation which would:

● increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class (subject to certain exceptions);
 

● increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class; or
 

● alter or change the powers, preferences or rights of such class so as to affect them adversely.

Under the Windstream charter, in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of Windstream capital stock required by the DGCL or the
Windstream charter, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of Windstream capital stock eligible to be cast in the election of directors is required in order to amend, alter, change or repeal the
sections of the Windstream charter related to the limitation of liability of directors and indemnification of directors and officers, the
prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, the calling of special meetings of stockholders, Windstream’s election to be covered
by Section 203 of the DGCL and the procedures required to amend the Windstream charter.

Under the Windstream charter, the Windstream Board is expressly authorized to amend, alter, change or repeal Windstream’s bylaws. The
stockholders also have the ability to amend, alter, change or repeal Windstream’s bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the then
outstanding shares entitled to vote, except that a two-thirds vote is required for the stockholders to amend sections of the Windstream
bylaws related to bringing matters before an annual stockholder meeting, nominating and electing directors and filling vacancies on the
Windstream Board and the procedures required to amend the Windstream bylaws.

Stockholder Action by
Written Consent

Under the DGCL, unless otherwise provided
in a corporation’s certificate of
incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of
stockholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, upon the written consent of
stockholders who would have been entitled
to cast the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and
voted.

The Windstream charter states that action by
written consent in lieu of a meeting of the
stockholders is prohibited so long as any
Windstream security is registered under
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

Under the DGCL, unless otherwise provided
in a corporation’s certificate of
incorporation, any action required or

stockholders who would have been entitled
to cast the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and
voted.

The EarthLink charter does not modify
EarthLink stockholders’ default power
under the DGCL to act by written consent.

Under the EarthLink bylaws, any
stockholder seeking to have the stockholders
authorize or take corporate action by written
consent must, by written notice to the
Secretary, request that the board of directors
fix a record date for the taking of such
action by written consent. This written
notice must include all information that
would be required under the EarthLink
charter or bylaws to be delivered if the
stockholder had been making a nomination
or proposing business to be considered at a
meeting of stockholders (which are
summarized further below). Upon such a
request, the board of directors must within
ten days after the date on which such written
notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing
the record date,

such ten day period, the record date will be
the first date after the expiration of such ten
day time period on which a signed written
consent setting forth the action taken or
proposed to be taken is delivered to
EarthLink.

The EarthLink bylaws also provide that
EarthLink must engage independent
inspectors of elections to perform promptly
a ministerial review of the validity of all
consents and revocations received, and no
stockholder action by written consent and
without a meeting will be effective until this
review is complete.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Windstream

Windstream held its regularly scheduled 2016 annual meeting of stockholders on May 12, 2016.

A Windstream stockholder who intended to present proposals at the 2017 annual meeting, and who wished to have those proposals
included in Windstream’s proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting, must have submitted those proposals no later than December 2,
2016. Stockholder proposals should have been addressed to the Corporate Secretary, 4001 North Rodney Parham Road, Little Rock,
Arkansas 72212. Such proposals must have met the requirements set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC in order to be eligible for
inclusion in the proxy statement for Windstream’s 2017 annual meeting.

If a Windstream stockholder does not submit a proposal for inclusion in Windstream’s 2017 proxy statement, stockholders may present it
directly at Windstream’s 2017 annual meeting. At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business will be conducted as that
which was properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the
notice of meeting (or any supplement) given by or at the direction of the Windstream Board, (ii) brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Windstream Board or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such proposed business, other than the nominations of persons for election to the
Windstream Board, must constitute a proper matter for stockholder actions, and the stockholder must have given timely notice in writing
to the Corporate Secretary of Windstream. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal
executive offices of Windstream, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding
annual meeting of stockholders. However, in the event that the annual meeting of stockholders is called for a date that is not within 25
days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business
on the tenth day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public announcement of such date was
made, whichever occurs first. In no event will the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting
commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above.

A stockholder’s notice to the secretary must set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the text of the proposal or business, (ii) the reason for
conducting such business and any material interest of the stockholder and any stockholder associated person, individually or in the
aggregate, including any anticipated benefit to the stockholder or stockholder associated person, (iii) the name and address, as they appear
on Windstream’s books, of the stockholder proposing such business and of any stockholder associated person, (iv) the class and number of
shares of Windstream which are beneficially owned by the stockholder and by any stockholder associated person, (v) a representation that
the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of Windstream entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at
the meeting to propose such business, (vi) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a
group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of Windstream’s
outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of
such proposal, and (vii) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by
or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares)
has

been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or
decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any such stockholder associated person with respect to any share of stock of
Windstream.

EarthLink

EarthLink held its regular annual meeting on April 26, 2016. Depending on when the mergers are completed, EarthLink may not hold an
annual meeting of stockholders in 2017.

An EarthLink stockholder who would like to have a proposal considered for inclusion in EarthLink’s 2017 proxy statement must have
submitted the proposal so that it was received by EarthLink no later than November 15, 2016. SEC rules set standards for eligibility and
specify the types of stockholder proposals that may be excluded from a proxy statement. Stockholder proposals should have been
addressed to the Corporate Secretary, 1170 Peachtree Street, Suite 900, Atlanta, GA 30309.

If an EarthLink stockholder did not submit a proposal for inclusion in EarthLink’s 2017 proxy statement, but instead wishes to present it
directly at EarthLink’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, EarthLink’s amended and restated by-laws require that such stockholder
notify EarthLink in writing not earlier than the close of business on the 90th and not later than the close of business on the 60th day prior
to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is
more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the
60th day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
such annual meeting was made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof
commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above.

In addition, such proposal must also constitute a proper matter for stockholder action and must include (a) a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and (b) as to
the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the business is proposed to be brought (i) the name and
address of such stockholder, as they appear on EarthLink’s books, of such beneficial owner, if any, and of each associated person referred
to in clause (iii), (ii) the employer and principal occupation of such stockholder, of such beneficial owner, if any, and of each associated
person referred to in clause (iii), (iii) (A) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of EarthLink which are, directly or
indirectly, owned beneficially, or of record, by such stockholder, by such beneficial owner, if any, or by any associated person of such
stockholder or beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or
conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of capital stock of EarthLink
or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any shares of capital stock of EarthLink, whether or not such instrument or
right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of EarthLink or otherwise, or any other direct or
indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of capital stock of
EarthLink, in each case that is, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially by such stockholder, by such beneficial owner, if any, or by any
associated person of such stockholder or beneficial owner, (C) any short interest in any shares of capital stock of EarthLink held by such
stockholder, by such beneficial owner, if any, or any associated person of such stockholder or beneficial owner (for purposes of this
section, a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract,
arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the
value of the subject security), (D) any rights to dividends on the

shares of capital stock of EarthLink owned beneficially by such stockholder, by such beneficial owner, if any, or by any associated person
of such stockholder or beneficial owner, in each case that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of capital stock of
EarthLink, (E) any proportionate interest in shares of capital stock of EarthLink or derivative instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a
general or limited partnership or limited liability company in which such stockholder, such beneficial owner if any, or any associated
person of such stockholder or beneficial owner is a general partner or manager or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest, and
(F) any performance related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder, such beneficial owner, if any, or any associated
person of such stockholder or beneficial owner is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of capital stock of
EarthLink or derivative instruments, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder, beneficial owner,
if any, or any associated person of such stockholder or beneficial owner, on the one hand, and any person or persons (including their
names), on the other hand, in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and any material interest of such
stockholder, beneficial owner or any associated person of such stockholder or beneficial owner in such business, (v) a representation that
such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to bring such business before the meeting, (vi) a representation
whether such stockholder intends to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to EarthLink’s stockholders and/or otherwise to solicit
proxies from stockholder in support of such business and (vii) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if
any, that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of
proxies for such business in a contested solicitation pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act. Any such notice shall be supplemented to
disclose the information referred to in clause (b) as of the record date and such supplement shall be delivered not later than five (5)
business days after the record date.

HOUSEHOLDING OF JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements
and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual
report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is being delivered to stockholders residing at the same address, unless stockholders have notified the company whose
shares they hold of their desire to receive multiple copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus,
or if you are receiving multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and wish to receive only one, please contact the company
whose shares you hold at its address identified below. Each of EarthLink and Windstream will promptly deliver, upon oral or written
request, a separate copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one copy was
mailed. Requests for additional copies should be directed to: Windstream Holdings, Inc., Attn: Investor Relations, 4001 Rodney Parham
Road, Little Rock, Arkansas 72212, (501) 748-7000 or to EarthLink Holdings Corp., Attn: Investor Relations, 1170 Peachtree St., Suite
900, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, (404) 815-0770.

OTHER MATTERS

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, neither the Windstream Board nor the EarthLink Board knows of any other matters
that may be presented for consideration at either the Windstream special meeting or the EarthLink special meeting. If any other business
does properly come before either the Windstream special meeting or the EarthLink special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy cards of EarthLink and Windstream will vote as they deem in the best
interests of EarthLink and Windstream, as applicable.

cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Services (the “Surviving Corporation”) and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger
Sub 1 in accordance with the DGCL. Immediately following the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA, the Surviving

Law) of those conditions), unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to the terms herein;
provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may occur on any other date agreed upon in writing

file a certificate of merger relating to the Subsequent Merger as contemplated by the DGCL and the DLLCA (the
“Subsequent Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State, executed and acknowledged by Merger Sub 2 in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. The Subsequent Merger shall become

Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Surviving Corporation and

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 Effect on Stock and Interests.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or the Company or the holders of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or the Company:

(i) Conversion of the Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2(f), each issued and
outstanding share (other than shares to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(iii)) of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) shall
thereupon be converted into the right to receive 0.818 fully paid and non-assessable shares (as the same
may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), the “Exchange Ratio”) of Parent Common Stock (the “Merger
Consideration”). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Book-Entry
Shares or a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder becomes
entitled upon surrender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without interest.

(ii) Merger Sub 1 Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub 1 (the “Merger Sub 1 Common Stock”) shall be converted into one
validly issued fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation (the “Surviving Corporation Common Stock”) and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after

the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub 1 Common Stock, if any, shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(iii) Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2-Owned Shares. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is issued and held by the Company or any of the Company’s direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur as a
result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock (or such rights that are convertible into shares of Company Common Stock) and Parent the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 2.1(b) shall be deemed to permit any action that Parent or the Company is otherwise
prohibited from taking pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Effect on Interests. At the Subsequent Effective Time, each share of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall be converted
into one limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company and each limited liability company interest
of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall be converted
into one limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Computershare Investor
Service L.L.C. to act as exchange agent hereunder (the “Exchange Agent”), for the purpose of exchanging
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the
“Certificates”) and shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”).

(b) Deposit of Merger Consideration. From time to time as needed, at or after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause the Surviving Company to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the equity holders of the Company entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement,
(i) certificates or, at Parent’s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing shares of Parent
Common Stock (the “Parent Certificates”) in such denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
specify sufficient

to pay the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(f)(ii), and (iii) unless the Company has already paid such amount to its transfer agent for distribution
to stockholders, an amount in cash equal to any Final Pre-Closing Quarterly Dividend for which Parent is
responsible under Section 5.16. Such Parent Certificates and such cash so deposited, together with any dividends
or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d) with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange
Fund”.

(c) Exchange Procedures.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), (x) a letter of transmittal in customary form (and
which shall specify, in the case of tendered Certificates, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Each former stockholder of the Company, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the
following:

(A) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such holder’s
shares of Company Common Stock, represented by such holder’s properly surrendered
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with Section 2.1,
and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled, and

(B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings
pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(iii)) equal to the amount of (x) the cash that such holder has the right
to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)(ii), plus
(y) the dividends such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 5.16.

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent Certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate (if applicable) shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and shall be presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other non-

income Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub 1,
the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under any provision of any Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payments. As of the date hereof, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 are not aware of any such
withholding obligation. Upon becoming aware of any such withholding obligation, Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall provide commercially reasonable
notice to the Person with respect to which such withholding obligation applies, and shall reasonably
cooperate with such Person to obtain any available reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts
shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent to the appropriate Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.1(a)(i), cash, if any, in lieu of
any fractional share in accordance with Section 2.2(f)(ii) and the dividends the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 5.16.

(v) No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this Article II.

(d) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time, or that are payable to the holders of record thereof who become such at or
after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
until such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II. All such
dividends and other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock that are to be paid in respect of the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case
until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II.

(ii) Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws and Laws with respect to the
withholding of Taxes, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be
paid to the holder of the Parent Certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other

Entry Shares, as applicable, for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Article II

of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f)(ii)) shall be deemed payment in full satisfaction of all rights

Exchange Fund in order to satisfy Parent’s obligation to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares, Parent shall
pay all commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs in connection with such sale,
if any.

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, and any distributions and dividends paid pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and Section 5.16 and any
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f)(ii)).

(h) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of Parent of shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.

(i) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 5.16 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall, immediately prior to such time, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or interests of any person
previously entitled thereto, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends pursuant to
Section 5.16, and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock (in each case, without
interest and subject to abandoned property, escheat, and other similar laws).

Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the

No investment or losses thereon shall affect the consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled under this Article II and to the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the amount required

to promptly pay in full the cash amounts contemplated by this Article II, Parent shall promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make in full such payments contemplated by this Article II.

(k) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the provision by such person of an indemnity, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration and, if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions
deliverable in accordance with this Article II in respect thereof.

Section 2.3 Treatment of Equity-Based Grants.

(a) Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option to
purchase or acquire a share of Company Common Stock (each, a “Company Stock Option”), whether such
Company Stock Option is then vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a
right to receive the Company Stock Option Consideration, if any. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Company
Stock Option Consideration” means a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option and the Exchange Ratio,
less (y) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option with a fair market value (based on the Company
Closing Price) that is equal to the sum of (1) the aggregate exercise price of the Company Stock Option (the
“Option Exercise Price”) plus (2) the amount of any withholding under the Code or any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Laws and (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, that any resulting fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock will be treated in the same manner as any resulting fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable as Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(f). For purposes of this Agreement, the
“Company Closing Price” means the closing price for a share of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) on the Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Parent shall issue (or cause to be issued) the Company Stock
Option Consideration as determined in accordance with this Section 2.3(a) to such holder as soon as practicable
(and no later than thirty (30) days) following the Effective Time. The right of a holder of any Company Stock
Option to receive the Company Stock Option Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of
any withholding under the Code or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Laws as described above.

(b) Company Restricted Stock Units. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding right to receive
Company Common Stock pursuant to a stock unit award granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a
“Company Restricted Stock Unit”) shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted stock unit with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common

Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit by the Exchange Ratio; provided, that any resulting
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be treated in the same manner as any resulting fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable as Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(f). The other pre-
existing terms of such Company Restricted Stock Units, including vesting, shall continue to apply in accordance
with their terms. Each Company Restricted Stock Unit assumed and converted pursuant to the terms of this
Section 2.3(b) shall be referred to as a “Parent Exchange Unit.”

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.3 (other than actions expressly required of Parent),
including obtaining any required consents. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery in connection with the settlement of the
Company Stock Option Consideration and the issuance of the Parent Exchange Units, including registering such
shares on an appropriate form of registration statement under the Securities Act, and maintaining the
effectiveness of such registration statement.

Circumstance has had or would reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate adverse impact on the
financial condition, properties, business or results of operations of such person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

such periods by the Company on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, but excluding the Joint
Proxy Statement, collectively, the “Company SEC Documents”). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as

documents required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time (the “Subsequent Company SEC Documents”) will comply in all material respects, with the

of Section 3.12 with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained,
and the Subsequent Company SEC Documents will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted, or will omit, to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements

consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) and (ii) complied at the time it was filed, and each of the
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of the Company included in the
Subsequent Company SEC Documents will comply at the time it is filed, as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since December 31, 2013 to the
date of this Agreement, the Company has not made any material change in the accounting practices or policies
applied in the preparation of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law and as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents.

Section 3.5 Internal Controls and Procedures. The Company is in compliance in all material respects
with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act relating thereto, which are applicable to the Company. Each of the principal executive officers and the
principal financial officers of the Company (or, as applicable, each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company), has made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-
14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
“principal executive officer” and “principal financial officer” shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, “extensions of credit” to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to applicable management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions
are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific
authorization; and (d) the recorded accounting for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any material

independent auditor of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting since December 31, 2013 and any other management letter or similar correspondence
from any independent auditor of the Company or any of their Subsidiaries received since December 31, 2013.
The Company has implemented such programs and taken such steps as it believes are necessary to effect
compliance with all provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, since December 31, 2013, has not
received, orally or in writing, any notification that its independent auditor (i) believes that the Company will not
be able to complete its assessment before the reporting deadline, or, if it will be completed prior to such
deadline, that it will not be completed in sufficient time for the independent auditor to complete its assessment or
(ii) will not be able to issue unqualified attestation reports with respect thereto.

Agreement and (iii) for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice, since December 31, 2015, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required
by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or required to be
disclosed in the notes thereto) that are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 3.7 No Violation of Law; Permits.

(a) Since December 31, 2013, except for such matters that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company

Governmental Entity (collectively, “Laws”) applicable to the Company, such Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”),
and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 3.7(a), no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made pursuant to
this Section 3.7(a) in respect of the matters referenced in Section 3.5 or in respect of environmental, employee
benefits, tax, labor, intellectual property or communications regulatory matters, which are the subject of the
representations and warranties made in Section 3.8, Section 3.9, Section 3.15, Section 3.16, Section 3.17 and

constitute Company Licenses, the “Company Permits”), except where the failure to have any Company Permit
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws and industry

License is subject to (i) any conditions or requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in
the same service, unless such conditions or requirements are set forth on the face of the applicable authorization
or have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or (ii) any pending proceeding by or before the FCC or State Regulators to
suspend, revoke or cancel, or any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or State Regulators with respect
thereto, unless such pending proceeding or judicial review has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

Company, there is no (A) event, condition or circumstance attributable specifically to the Company that would

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No
Company License, order or other agreement, obtained from, issued by or concluded with any State Regulator
imposes or would impose restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to make payments,
dividends or other distributions to the Company or any other Subsidiary of the Company that limits, or would
reasonably be expected to limit, the cash funding and management alternatives of the Company on a
consolidated basis in a manner disproportionate to restrictions applied by such State Regulators to similarly
situated companies.

(c) The Company, with respect to any Company License and any activity regulated by the FCC or
State Regulators but not requiring a license (“Unlicensed Activity”), and each licensee of each Company
License and each Subsidiary engaged in Unlicensed Activity (“Unlicensed Subsidiary”) is, and since December
31, 2013 has been, in compliance with each Company License and has fulfilled and performed all of its
obligations with respect thereto and with respect to any Unlicensed Activity required by the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) or the rules, regulations, written policies and orders of the
FCC (the “FCC Rules”) or similar rules, regulations, written policies and orders of State Regulators, and the
payment of all regulatory fees and contributions, except (i) for exemptions, waivers or similar concessions or
allowances and (ii) where such failure to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or
contributions has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and each licensee of each Company License and each
Unlicensed Subsidiary is in good standing with the FCC and all other Governmental Entities, and neither the
Company nor any licensee or Unlicensed Subsidiary is, to the knowledge of the Company, the respondent with
respect to any formal complaint, investigation, audit, inquiry, subpoena, forfeiture, or petition to suspend before
the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (the “USAC”) or any other Governmental Entity (each
an “Enforcement Proceeding”), except where any such Enforcement Proceedings have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity and controls one
hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and decision-making authority of each licensee of the Company
Licenses and each Unlicensed Subsidiary.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material cease-and-desist order
or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with,
or has been ordered to pay any material civil money penalty by, the FCC, USAC or any other Governmental
Entity (other than a taxing authority, which is covered by Section 3.15), other than those of general application
that apply to similarly situated providers of the same services or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence,
whether or not set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, a “Company Regulatory Agreement”), nor has the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing since December 31, 2013 by any Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Company Regulatory Agreement.

Section 3.22 Affiliate Transactions. Since December 31, 2013, all transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings between the Company and the Company’s affiliates or other persons
(“Company Affiliate Transactions”) that are required to be disclosed in the Company SEC Documents in
accordance with Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the SEC have been so disclosed.

Section 3.23 Takeover Provisions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations contained in Section
4.14(a), the Company Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby the restrictions on “business
combinations” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. Assuming the
accuracy of the representation contained in Section 4.14(a), to the knowledge of the Company, no other state
“fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition” or similar state antitakeover statute or regulation is
applicable to the Combination or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.24 Insurance. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains insurance policies with
reputable insurance carriers against all risks of a character and in such amounts as are usually insured against by
similarly situated companies in the same or similar businesses. All such policies are in full force and effect and
were in full force and effect during the periods of time each such insurance policy is purported to be in effect
and all premiums due with respect to such policies have either been paid or adequate provision for the payment
thereof by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has been made, except for such failures to be in full force and
effect or to pay such premiums as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is,
with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, in breach or default (including any such breach or default with
respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of notice) under any such policies, except as has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. There is no material claim by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any such policies
that (a) has been denied or disputed by the insurer other than denials and disputes in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or (b) if not paid would cause a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company has made available to Parent a summary of all material insurance policies maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 3.25 Finders or Brokers. Except for the Company Financial Advisors, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder or other person in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial advisor’s or
other similar fee or commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Combination or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.26 Swap Agreements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
agreement with respect to any swap, forward, future or derivative transaction or option or similar agreement
involving, or settled by reference to, one or more rates, currencies, commodities, equity or debt instruments or
securities, or economic, financial or pricing indices or measures of economic, financial or pricing risk or value
or any similar transaction or any combination of these transactions.

Section 3.27 Real Property; Networks.

(a) Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (a) either the Company or its Subsidiaries owns, and has
good and valid title to, all of its owned real property and has valid leasehold interests in all of its leased
properties, free and clear of all Liens, (b) all leases with respect to real property to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, including all collocation agreements, are valid and in full force and effect against the
Company or such Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, the counterparties thereto, in accordance
with their respective terms, (c) there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (d) the properties owned or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries are in all respects,
adequate and sufficient, and in satisfactory condition, to support the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

information related to the network of the Company and its Subsidiaries: (i) a list of all switch locations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) maps that depict generally the fiber routes operated by the Company and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Network Facilities”). The Network Facilities are in all material respects in
good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. With respect to each Network Facility,
except as set forth on Section 3.27(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of the Company, any
notices or other actions required to be taken to renew the term of such Network Facility for any upcoming
renewal term have been taken or given in the manner and within the time provided in such Network Facility
agreement or contract (or the time period provided for giving of such notice or to undertake such action has not
expired) to effectively renew the term of such Network Facility agreement or contract for the upcoming term
thereof to the extent that such Network Facility agreement or contract is renewable by its terms and the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Network Facility agreement or contract. To the
knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, or circumstance exists, that, but for the passage of time or
giving of notice, would preclude any Network Facility agreement or contract from being renewed in accordance
with the terms thereof to the extent the Company or its applicable Subsidiary intends to renew such Network
Facility agreement or contract. Each of the Network Facilities is free and clear of all Liens and other rights in
favor of other persons, subject, however, to the terms of the agreements or contracts pursuant to which such
Network Facilities were acquired.

(c) Section 3.27(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date hereof, material
interconnection agreements (the “Interconnection Agreements”) entered into pursuant to Sections 251 and 252 of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”), between the Company or its Subsidiaries
and incumbent local exchange carriers (each, an “ILEC”). All Interconnection Agreements include the general
terms, conditions and pricing for any unbundled network elements (“UNEs”), collocation or other network
facilities or services provided under Sections 251 and 252 of the Telecommunications Act to the Company and
its Subsidiaries by the ILECs. An Interconnection Agreement has been

processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and
that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent’s and Services’ management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required

to any Parent Material Contract is in breach of or default under the terms of any Parent Material Contract where
such breach or default has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each Parent Material Contract is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Parent or the Subsidiary of Parent that is party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent, of each other party

Section 4.21 Communications Regulatory Matters.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold all approvals, authorizations, certificates and licenses
issued by the FCC or State Regulators and all other material regulatory permits, approvals, licenses and other
authorizations, including franchises, ordinances and other agreements granting access to public rights of way,
issued or granted to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity that are required for Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as presently conducted (collectively, the “Parent Licenses”),
except such Parent Licenses the failure of which to so hold has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(b) Each Parent License is valid and in full force and effect and has not been suspended, revoked,
canceled or adversely modified, except where the failure to be in full force and effect, or the suspension,
revocation, cancellation or modification of which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No Parent License is subject to (i) any
conditions or requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses in the same service, unless such
conditions or requirements are set forth on the face of the applicable authorization or have not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (ii)
any pending proceeding by or before the FCC or State Regulators to suspend, revoke or cancel, or any judicial
review of a decision by the FCC or State Regulators with respect thereto, unless such pending proceeding or
judicial review has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no event, condition or circumstance
attributable specifically to Parent that would preclude any Parent License from being renewed in the ordinary
course (to the extent that such Parent License is renewable by its terms), except where the failure to be renewed
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

(c) Parent, with respect to any Parent License and any Unlicensed Activity, and each licensee of
each Parent License and each Unlicensed Subsidiary is, and since December 31, 2013 has been, in compliance
with each Parent License and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto and with
respect to any Unlicensed Activity required by the Communications Act or the FCC Rules or similar rules,
regulations, written policies and orders of State Regulators, and the payment of all regulatory fees and
contributions, except (i) for exemptions, waivers or similar concessions or allowances and (ii) where such failure
to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or contributions has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
and each licensee of each Parent License and Unlicensed Subsidiary is in good standing with the FCC and all
other Governmental Entities, and neither Parent nor any such licensee or Unlicensed Subsidiary is, to the
knowledge of Parent, the respondent with respect to any Enforcement Proceeding, except where any such
Enforcement Proceedings have not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent owns one hundred percent
(100%) of the equity and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and decision making
authority of each licensee of the Parent Licenses and each Unlicensed Subsidiary.

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material cease-and-desist order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with or
has been ordered to pay any material civil money penalty by, the FCC, USAC or any other Governmental Entity
(other than a taxing authority, which is covered by Section 4.15), other than those of general application that
apply to similarly situated providers of the same services or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence,
whether or not set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, a “Parent Regulatory Agreement”), nor has Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing since December 31, 2013 by any Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Parent Regulatory Agreement.

Section 4.22 Affiliate Transactions. Since December 31, 2013, all transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings between Parent and Parent’s affiliates or other persons (“Parent Affiliate
Transactions”) that are required to be disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents in accordance with Item 404 of
Regulation S-K of the SEC have been so disclosed.

Section 4.23 Takeover Provisions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations contained in Section
3.14, the Parent Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement,
the Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby the restrictions on “business combinations” (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. Assuming the accuracy of the
representation contained in Section 3.14(a), to the knowledge of Parent, no other state “fair price,”
“moratorium,” “control share acquisition” or similar state antitakeover statute or regulation is applicable to the
Combination or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.24 Insurance. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries maintains insurance policies with reputable
insurance carriers against all risks of a character and in such amounts as are usually insured against by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses. All such policies are in full force and effect and were in
full force and effect during the periods of time each such insurance policy is purported to be in effect and all
premiums due with respect to such policies have either been paid or adequate provision for the payment thereof
by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has been made, except for such failures to be in full force and effect
or to pay such premiums as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is, with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both, in breach or default (including any such breach or default with respect to the
payment of premiums or the giving of notice) under any such policies, except as has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is
no material claim by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any such policies that (a) has been denied or
disputed by the insurer other than denials and disputes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or (b) if not paid would cause a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has made available to the

Representatives) (provided that all such information has previously been provided to the Company or is
provided to the Company prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality
Agreement is to the Company, including with respect to any standstill or similar provisions contained therein,
and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with the person or group making such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (and
such person’s or group’s Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent agree that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4(a) applicable to Parent by any of its Representatives,
to the extent acting on its behalf or at its direction, shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.4(a) by Parent.

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the Company), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any
manner adverse to the Company), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Parent
Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Stock Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment, or (B) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Parent Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii)
allow Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding agreement in connection with any
Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted pursuant to
Section 5.4(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation

Change (and, in the case of clause (1) of this sentence, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h)) (1)
if the Parent Board determines hereunder that a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a Superior
Parent Proposal or (2) in response to any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Parent
Board as of the date of this Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes
known to the Parent Board prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and does not involve or relate to a
Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal, in either case, the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal which constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h) unless, in either case, (A) Parent has given the Company at least three (3) Business
Days’ prior written notice (a “Parent Notice of Change”) that the Parent Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including, in the case of a Superior Parent Proposal, the material terms of any
Superior Parent Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Parent Board, including the identity of
the person making such Superior Parent Proposal and a copy of the agreement or proposal with respect to such
Superior Parent Proposal (it being understood and agreed that a material amendment to any material term of
such Superior Parent Proposal shall require a new Parent Notice of Change and a new two (2) Business Day
period), (B) during such three (3) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, Parent has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, with the Company in good faith, to the extent the
Company desires to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose in writing a binding offer to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, if applicable, such Parent Alternative
Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Parent Proposal or, in connection with a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change not involving or relating to a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal, would cause
the Parent Board no longer to believe that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (C) at the end of such
three (3) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, the Parent Board shall have considered in
good faith such binding offer and shall have determined that the Superior Parent Proposal continues to constitute
a Superior Parent Proposal or, other than in the case of a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal, that it would
continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law
if the Parent Board failed to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. Subject to Parent’s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), notwithstanding any Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, Parent shall cause the approvals of the Parent Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance to be
submitted to a vote of Parent stockholders at the Parent Stockholders’ Meeting.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), at any time prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day
after knowledge of Parent of the receipt thereof) advise the Company in writing of its receipt of any Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal (including

a copy thereof, if made in writing), and the identity of the person or group making such Parent Alternative
Transaction Proposal. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any material
developments with respect to any such Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal (including any material changes
to the terms thereof) (and Parent shall as promptly as practicable after knowledge of Parent of the receipt thereof
provide the Company with copies of any material written materials relating to such Parent Alternative
Transaction Proposal or any material changes to the terms thereof).

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit Parent from (x) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making “stop-
look-and-listen” communications of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act or (y) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of Parent if, in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board (after consultation
with its outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
provided, however, that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability of the Parent Board with respect to this Agreement, the Combination, the Parent
Charter Amendment, the Stock Issuance or a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent Board in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement, the Combination, the Parent Charter
Amendment and the Stock Issuance has not changed; provided, further, that this Section 5.4(d) shall not be
deemed to permit Parent or the Parent Board or any committee thereof to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change except in accordance with Section 5.4(b).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) “Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal” means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) by a third party or group relating to any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in
any: (i) merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, share exchange, other business combination or
similar transaction involving Parent (A) pursuant to which any person (or the stockholders of any person)
or group, other than the stockholders of Parent (as a group) immediately prior to the consummation of
such transaction, would hold Parent Common Stock representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
voting power of the surviving or resulting entity after giving effect to the consummation of such
transaction or (B) as a result of which the stockholders of Parent (as a group) immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction would hold Parent Common Stock representing less than eighty-five
percent (85%) of the voting power of the surviving or resulting entity after giving effect to the
consummation of such transaction, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, share exchange, other business
combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary of
Parent or otherwise), of any business or assets of Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent representing fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Parent and the Subsidiaries of
Parent, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any person (or
the stockholders of any

person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of
Parent, (iv) transaction in which any person (or the stockholders of any person) shall acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group
which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, fifteen percent (15%) or more
of the Parent Common Stock or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than in
connection with the Stock Issuance and the Combination).

(ii) “Superior Parent Proposal” means any bona fide written Parent Alternative Transaction
Proposal made by a third party or group (i) on terms which the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) to be superior, from a financial point of
view, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Stock Issuance and the
Combination, for Parent or holders of Parent Common Stock, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by the Company to the
terms of this Agreement), and (ii) that the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisors) would reasonably be expected to be completed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including the financing terms of
any such proposal and conditions to its consummation); provided, however, that for purposes of the
reference to a Parent Alternative Transaction Proposal in this definition of Superior Parent Proposal, all
references to “fifteen percent (15%)” and “eighty-five percent (85%)” in the definition of Parent
Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%).”

Section 5.5 No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation.

(a) During the No-Shop Period, the Company shall not, and shall instruct its affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives not to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or
encourage any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with
respect to, or knowingly cooperate in any way with any person in connection with soliciting, initiating,
facilitating or encouraging, any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or the submission or making of any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal.
During the No-Shop Period, the Company shall, and shall instruct its affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, or any inquiry
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such person or its Representatives that was
provided by or on behalf of the

Company in connection with any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval the Company or any of its Representatives receives a Company Alternative Transaction
Proposal that did not result from any breach of this Section 5.5(a), (i) the Company and its Representatives may
contact the person or group making the Company Alternative Transaction Proposal solely to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof or to request that any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal made orally be made in
writing and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) that such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, then the Company and any of its Representatives may, subject
to compliance with Section 5.5(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the person or group making such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its or their Representatives)
(provided that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent, including with
respect to any standstill or similar provisions contained therein, and (y) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with the person or
group making such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal (and such person’s or group’s Representatives).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.5(a) applicable to the Company by any of its Representatives, to the extent acting on its behalf or
at its direction, shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.5(a) by the Company.

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Company
Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any binding agreement in connection with any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement expressly permitted pursuant to Section 5.5(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of
clause (1) of this sentence, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)) (1) if the Company Board
determines hereunder that a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a Superior Company
Proposal or (2) in response to any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence
becomes known to the Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and does not
involve or relate to

a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, in either case, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal which constitutes a Superior Company Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) unless, in either case, (A) the Company has given Parent at least three (3)
Business Days’ prior written notice (a “Company Notice of Change”) that the Company Board intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, the
material terms of any Superior Company Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board, including the identity of the person making such Superior Company Proposal and a copy of the
agreement or proposal with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood and agreed that a
material amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company
Notice of Change and a new two (2) Business Day period), (B) during such three (3) Business Day or two (2)
Business Day period, as applicable, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent in good faith, to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in
writing a binding offer to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, if
applicable, such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Company Proposal
or, in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change not involving or relating to a Company
Alternative Transaction Proposal, would cause the Company Board no longer to believe that the failure to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and (C) at the end of such three (3) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period,
as applicable, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith such binding offer and shall have
determined that the Superior Company Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal or, other
than in the case of a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, that it would continue to be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law if the Company Board failed to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Subject to the Company’s right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall cause the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Combination to be submitted to a
vote of the Company’s stockholders at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 5.5(a) and 5.5(b), at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one
(1) Business Day after knowledge of the Company of the receipt thereof) advise Parent in writing of its receipt
of any Company Alternative Transaction Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company
Alternative Transaction Proposal (including a copy thereof, if made in writing), and the identity of the person or
group making such Company Alternative Transaction Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
reasonably prompt basis of any material developments with respect to any such Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal (including any material changes to the terms thereof) (and the Company shall as promptly
as practicable after knowledge of the

Company of the receipt thereof provide Parent with copies of any material written materials relating to such
Company Alternative Transaction Proposal or any material changes to the terms thereof).

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Company from (x) taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making
“stop-look-and-listen” communications of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act or (y)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Company Board with respect to this Agreement, the
Combination or a Company Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly states
that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the Combination has not changed; provided, further,
that this Section 5.5(d) shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with Section 5.5(b).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) “Company Alternative Transaction Proposal” means any proposal or offer (whether or not
in writing) by a third party or group relating to any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in
any: (i) merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, share exchange, other business combination or
similar transaction involving the Company (A) pursuant to which any person (or the stockholders of any
person) or group, other than the stockholders of the Company (as a group) immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction, would hold Company Common Stock representing fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the voting power of the surviving or resulting entity after giving effect to the
consummation of such transaction or (B) as a result of which the stockholders of the Company (as a
group) immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction would hold Company Common Stock
representing less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the voting power of the surviving or resulting entity
after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other
equity interests in a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise), of any business or assets of the Company or
the Subsidiaries of the Company representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated revenues,
net income or assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance,
sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any person (or the stockholders of any person) or group
of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv)

owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, fifteen percent (15%) or more of the Company
Common Stock or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Combination).

(ii) “Superior Company Proposal” means any bona fide written Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal made by a third party or group (i) on terms which the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) to be superior, from a

for the holders of Company Common Stock, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement),
and (ii) that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) would reasonably be expected to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including the financing terms of any such proposal
and conditions to its consummation); provided, however, that for purposes of the reference to a Company
Alternative Transaction Proposal in this definition of Superior Company Proposal, all references to
“fifteen percent (15%)” and “eighty-five percent (85%)” in the definition of Company Alternative
Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%).”

Section 5.6 Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders’ Meetings.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event
within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement or such later date as the parties may mutually agree in
writing), Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement, and
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included as
a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments
from the SEC (and shall promptly provide copies of any such comments and responses thereto to the other party)
and to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Parent’s
stockholders, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company’s stockholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to
service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock and Parent Restricted Stock Units in the Merger and in connection with the
reservation for issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock as described in Section 2.3(a), and each such
party shall furnish all information concerning such party and its stockholders as may be reasonably requested by
the other party in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement, and no response to SEC comments thereon, as the case may be, shall be made by
either party without the other’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,

conditioned or delayed) and without providing such other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon (and each party shall consider in good faith for inclusion in such document all comments reasonably
proposed by the other). Each of Parent and the Company shall advise the other promptly after receipt of oral or
written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information, and shall promptly provide the other party with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information (including any termination, withdrawal, modification or change of the Parent Board
Recommendation or the Company Board Recommendation) relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to ensure that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.

(b) Subject to each of Parent’s and the Company’s rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(h) and Section 7.1(g), respectively, each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action reasonably necessary in
accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents, in the case of the Company, and
the Parent Organizational Documents, in the case of Parent, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days (or such
longer period as mutually agreed between the Company and Parent) after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act, to consider, in the case of the Company, the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Combination (the “Company Stockholders’ Meeting”), and, in the case of Parent, the approval of
the Parent Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance (the “Parent Stockholders’ Meeting”) and, subject to each
of Parent’s and the Company’s rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) and Section 7.1(g),
respectively, and to the provisions of this Section 5.6(b) with respect to any adjournment or postponement, each
of the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Stockholders’
Meeting and the Company Stockholders’ Meeting to be held on the same day. In the absence of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or a termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(g), in the
case of the Company, and in the absence of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(h), in the case of Parent, each of the Company and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of, in the case of the
Company, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Combination and, in the case of Parent, the
approval of the Parent Charter Amendment and the Stock Issuance, and

the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company or Parent shall adjourn or postpone, on one or more
occasions and whether or not a quorum is present, the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or the Parent

Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the date hereof or as

Parent shall ensure that each Company Employee who is not party to either a Company Individual Agreement
providing severance benefits or the Company Change in Control Severance Plan shall receive severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Section 5.7(b) shall be deemed
to be a guarantee of employment to any employee or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to impose any
obligation on Parent or its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any person.

(c) Parent and its affiliates shall recognize the service of employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to Closing as service with Parent for all purposes in connection with

policies) maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates following the Effective Time to the extent credited for such
purpose by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) for benefit

participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under any group health plan (as
defined in Section 4980B of the Code) that is made available to such employees following the Effective Time by
Parent or one of its affiliates, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by such employees under any group health plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries during the portion of the
relevant plan year following the Effective Time in which Company Employees first participate therein for
purposes of any applicable co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
group health plan of Parent and its affiliates.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any
employee benefit plan. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and nothing in this Section 5.7, express or implied, shall (i) be deemed or construed to establish
any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, (iii) prevent or limit Parent, the Surviving Company or any
Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in
accordance with their terms, or (iv) create any third-party rights in any Company Employee (or any beneficiaries

any filings are required to be made with, or Consents are required to be obtained from, any other third
parties (including any Consents required under any contract to which a party hereto is bound) or

the actions referred to in Sections 5.9(a) and 5.9(b)); provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to
restrict Parent in attending such meetings or participating in such substantive conversations without the
Company; provided that, to the extent reasonably practicable, it has given the Company reasonable prior
notice of any such meeting or conversation and that it keeps the Company reasonably apprised with
respect thereto. The Company shall not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive

not to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.9
(but subject to Section 5.9(e)), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding
by a private party, is instituted or if any objections are asserted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law or not in the public interest, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and take all actions necessary to contest and

prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.9 shall limit a party’s right to

Subsidiaries’ freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its Subsidiaries) in each case, as may be required in
order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to consummate the Combination, or avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding,
that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing; provided, that any action taken
pursuant to this Section 5.9 is conditioned upon the consummation of the Combination; provided further, that
Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries shall not be required to, and Parent, the Company and their
Subsidiaries shall not be permitted to (without other’s prior written consent), (1) divest or otherwise dispose of

reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a material adverse effect on the assets,
liabilities, business, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company), taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Combination (it being
understood that such material adverse effect shall be measured solely on a scale relative to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the Combination), (the requirement to take the actions
described in each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a “Substantial Detriment”); and Company nor any of its

securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Parent and the Company agree that the initial
press release (or releases) to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
in the form previously agreed to by the parties (the “Announcement”). Notwithstanding the forgoing, this
Section 5.11 shall not apply to any press release or other public statement made by the Company or Parent (a)
which is consistent with the Announcement and the terms of this Agreement and does not contain any
information relating to the Company or Parent that has not been previously announced or made public in

the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be (individually, an “Indemnified Party” and,
collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or indemnification agreements
with any Indemnified Party listed in Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Combination and shall continue (or, in the case of the Company
following the Subsequent Merger, shall continue to be provided for in the limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Company) in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time.
For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, judgments, fines and, with Parent’s prior
consent, amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened or actual civil, criminal or administrative
action, suit, litigation, arbitration, mediation, claim, hearing, inquiry investigation or other proceeding (an
“Action”) to which such Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such individual is or was a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such
Action, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses incurred in the defense
of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law

within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Surviving Company from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor
together with reasonable documentation thereof; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.12(a), upon learning of
any such Action, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such Action (arising after the Effective Time),
(i) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Parties, or between the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Parent shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 5.12(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; provided further, that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest
shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 5.12 to the contrary, Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) maintain
in effect directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the Company’s currently in force directors’ and officers’
liability insurance (“Current Company D&O Insurance”), on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts
that are no less favorable than those of the Current Company D&O Insurance; provided, however, that if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance exceeds three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium for
such insurance as of the date hereof (the “Premium Cap”), then the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause to
be provided a policy covering such individuals with the greatest coverage as is then available at a cost up to but
not exceeding such Premium Cap. The Company may (or if requested by Parent, the Company shall), in
consultation with Parent, purchase prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and
conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits in the aggregate as the Current Company D&O
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the Combination and other transactions contemplated by

this Agreement, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding the aggregate maximum amount payable pursuant
to the proviso above for such six-year period. If such prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.12(c) and the Surviving
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.12 to the contrary, the rights of the Indemnified
Parties and their heirs and legal representatives under this Section 5.12 shall be in addition to any rights such
Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the indemnification agreements listed in Section
5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or under any other applicable Laws.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

Section 5.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to approve in advance in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP SEC No-Action
Letter (January 12, 1999) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
respective officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or who will
become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with
respect to equity securities of the Company or Parent, as the case may be.

Section 5.14 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other’s operations prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations.

Section 5.15 Parent Board; Governance Matters.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary to increase
the size of the Parent Board to twelve (12) members and to appoint to the Parent Board three (3) members of the
Company’s Board of Directors selected by the Company from any of the directors elected at or appointed after
the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders of the Company (the “Company Designees”); provided, that such
directors are reasonably acceptable to Parent taking into account Parent’s normal corporate governance process
for selection of its board members, including, but not limited to, a review of such individuals’ skills, experience
and independence; provided, further, that if any Company

Designee is not acceptable to Parent in its reasonable discretion, or is unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent
Board, then the Company shall select a different director in accordance with this Section 5.15(a) (who shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent) until three (3) Company Designees are able and willing to serve on the Parent
Board and have been deemed reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Designees shall serve as directors of Parent
until the next annual meeting of Parent’s stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified in
accordance with the organizational documents of Parent. Subject to consummation of the Combination, Parent
shall cause the Company Designees to be included in Parent’s proxy statement in respect of the first annual
meeting of stockholders immediately following the Closing, as nominees of Parent for election to the Parent
Board and shall solicit proxies in favor of the election of the Company Designees to the Parent Board from the
stockholders of Parent eligible to vote for the election of directors at such next annual meeting, using efforts no
less than the efforts used to solicit proxies in favor of the election of other individuals nominated to the Parent
Board by Parent.

Section 5.16 Dividend Matters. Parent and the Company shall coordinate with each other to designate
the same record and payment dates for Parent’s and the Company’s respective quarterly dividends declared in
any calendar quarter in which the Closing Date might reasonably be expected to occur; provided, that each of
Parent and Company shall designate the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date as the record and
payment date for each such party’s final quarterly dividend (the “Final Pre-Closing Quarterly Dividend”), which
shall be in an amount equal to each party’s respective regular quarterly cash dividend, pro-rated based on the
number of days elapsed in such calendar quarter up to such record date. After the Closing Date, all holders of
Parent Common Stock (including former holders of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options who
have received Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger) shall be entitled to receive with respect to each
such share of Parent Common Stock, as and when declared by the Parent Board, on the next record date for
payment of dividends with respect to Parent Common Stock, Parent’s regular quarterly cash dividend in effect as
of the date hereof, pro-rated based on the number of days from the Closing Date through such subsequent record
date.

Section 5.17 Financing Efforts and Related Cooperation.

(a) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably and promptly informed on the status of material
developments in respect of any Financing (as defined below).

(b) Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of any
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Financing has not been obtained,
Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall continue to be obligated, prior to any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 and subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI, to complete the Combination and consummate the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

its preparation of the offers to purchase, consent solicitation statements, letters of transmittal and/or forms of
consent and other related documentation. The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary
or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Tender Offers shall be selected by Parent. Parent shall be
permitted to (i) waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offers (other than the occurrence of the Closing)
and make any other change to the Debt Tender Offers and (ii) extend the offer period and consent period
applicable to a Debt Tender Offer to a date selected by Parent. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take all other actions and obtain and/or execute and deliver all other documents (including, after the Effective

Parent to effect the Debt Tender Offers or any consent solicitations.

(c) If requested by Parent, in lieu of Parent commencing a Debt Tender Offer for any portion of any
series of Existing Notes, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted by such series
of Existing Notes and the applicable Existing Indenture, to (A) substantially simultaneously with the Closing,
issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of
Existing Notes, pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Existing Indenture at a time designated by Parent but
no earlier than the Closing Date, and (B) take any other actions (including delivering such officer’s certificates
and opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent) at and after the Effective Time reasonably requested by
Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of such series of Existing Notes and the release of any Liens in
connection therewith pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Existing Indenture and the other provisions of
such Existing Indenture applicable thereto at a time designated by Parent but no earlier than the Closing Date;
provided, that substantially simultaneously to the Company’s being required to issue such notice of optional
redemption, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the Trustee under the applicable
Existing Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of any series of Existing Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to
collectively as the “Satisfaction and Discharge” of such series of Existing Notes. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Satisfaction and Discharge of any series of Existing Notes identified
to the Company by Parent at any time. Upon completion of the Satisfaction and Discharge, the Company shall

Company must within two (2) Business Days after such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its
designee an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and their respective
Affiliates for all fees and expenses (up to a maximum amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000)) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Parent Expenses”) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(d) Company Expenses. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), then
Parent must within two (2) Business Days after such termination pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its
designee an amount equal to that required to reimburse the Company and its Affiliates for all fees and expenses
(up to a maximum amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000)) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Company Expenses”) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company.

(e) Interest and Costs; Other Remedies. All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, it being understood that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, on more than one occasion. Each of Parent and the
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent or the Company, as applicable, fails to pay in a timely manner the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company makes a
claim that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as applicable, for such payment, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the other party its reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in this Section 7.3 at the rate of interest per annum publicly announced by Bank of America,
N.A. (or any successor thereto or other major money center commercial bank agreed to by the parties hereto) as

made.

(f) Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated and such termination gives rise to the obligation of the Company to pay the Company
Termination Fee and the Company Expenses or Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent
Expenses, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 7.3, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and the
Company Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, as applicable, if and when due, the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or the Company, as applicable, against the other party and its associated
Covered Persons for any breach, loss or damage arising out of, or related to, this Agreement (including the
termination thereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be the payment of the Company Termination
Fee and the Company Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, as applicable, and
Parent, in the case of any payment to it of the Company Termination Fee and the Company Expenses, or the
Company, in the case of any payment to it of the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, shall have no
rights or claims against the other party or its associated Covered Persons arising out of, or related to, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and neither the Company, in the case of any payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Company
Expenses to Parent, nor Parent, in the case of any payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent
Expenses to the Company, nor their respective associated Covered Persons shall have any further liability or
obligation arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that, in
the event that the termination of this Agreement does not give rise to an immediate right of payment of the
Company Termination Fee and the Company Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses,
as applicable, due to the terms of this Section 7.3 and either party shall have instituted an Action and/or the
parties shall have settled any Action or otherwise resulting in payment of any damages or other amounts by one
party to the other, then the amount of the Company Termination Fee and the Company Expenses or the Parent
Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, as applicable, shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any
such payment by the Company or Parent, as applicable, described above in this proviso (and thereafter the sole
and exclusive remedy provisions of this Section 7.3(f) shall apply in all respects), including for any loss suffered
as a result of the failure of the Combination to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise, including for any willful and material breach or actual and intentional fraud, whether in equity or
at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise. If this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(g) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(h) and the Company pays the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3(a) or Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(b), as
applicable, or (y) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(i), the Company elects to receive the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(iv), and Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3(b), then in each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), such payment of the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee shall, together with the Company Expenses and Parent Expenses, as
and if applicable, be the sole and exclusive monetary damages remedy of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2 and their associated Cover Persons against the Company, in the case of Parent, and be the sole and exclusive
monetary damages remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, in the case of the
Company and its associated Cover Persons, for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Combination to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, including for

any willful and material breach or actual and intentional fraud, whether in equity or at Law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(i) and the Company elects
not to demand payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(iv), the Company shall
be entitled to seek damages to the fullest extent provided hereunder; provided, however, that in the event the
Company commences an Action to seek damages hereunder following termination, it shall irrevocably forfeit
and waive any right to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(iv). The foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Company to seek specific performance of this Agreement prior to its termination, including
in the event the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i). For the avoidance of
doubt, (x) the Company does not waive its right to seek monetary damages (including the Parent Termination
Fee) in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in the event the Company brings an Action
for specific performance prior to termination of this Agreement and the Closing does not occur following such
Action and (y) the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3(f) shall not apply to the rights and obligations of the
parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which rights and obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

Section 7.4 Amendment or Supplement. At any time before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Combination by the respective stockholders of the Company and Parent and prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in writing by the Company and Parent with
respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement, except that following approval by the stockholders of
the Company or Parent there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law or in
accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ or this Agreement requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval, nor shall there be any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law.

Section 7.5 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent may:

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party;

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Chancery Court”) or, if the Chancery Court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction or declines jurisdiction, in any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Chancery Court or, if the Chancery Court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction or declines jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other

suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other
than action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when
expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically
be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding
or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

Section 8.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB 1, MERGER SUB 2 AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

ANNEX B

November 5, 2016

The Board of Directors
EarthLink Holdings Corp. 
1170 Peachtree Street 
Atlanta, GA 30309

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that EarthLink Holdings Corp. (“EarthLink”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 5, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), among EarthLink, Windstream Holdings, Inc. (“Windstream”), Europa Merger Sub, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream (“Merger Sub 1”), and Europa Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream
(“Merger Sub 2”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into EarthLink (the “Merger”) and each
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of EarthLink (“EarthLink Common Stock”) will be converted into the right
to receive 0.818 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Windstream (“Windstream Common
Stock”). Immediately following the Merger, EarthLink, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, will be merged with and into Merger
Sub 2 (the “Subsequent Merger” and, together with the Merger, the “Combination”). The terms and conditions of the Combination are
more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of EarthLink Common Stock of the
Exchange Ratio provided for in the Merger.

Section 8.12 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of
the parties only, and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

     (6)      reviewed certain estimates as to the amount and timing of cost savings (collectively, the “Synergies”) anticipated by the
management of EarthLink to result from the Combination;

 
(7) reviewed the trading history for EarthLink Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories

of certain other publicly traded companies we deemed relevant;
 
(8) reviewed the relative financial contributions of EarthLink and Windstream to the future financial performance of the combined

company on a pro forma basis;
 
(9) reviewed the Merger Agreement; and
 
(10) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other factors as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, including without
limitation the Windstream Forecasts, EarthLink Forecasts and Synergies, and have relied upon the assurances of the managements of
EarthLink and Windstream that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or
misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Windstream Forecasts, we have assumed, at your direction and without independent
verification, that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of the management of Windstream as to the future financial performance of Windstream, and at your direction we have relied
upon the Windstream Forecasts for purposes of our analysis. With respect to the EarthLink Forecasts, we have assumed, at your direction
and without independent verification, that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of the management of EarthLink as to the future financial performance of EarthLink. With respect to
the Synergies, we have assumed, at your direction and without independent verification, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of EarthLink as to the matters covered
thereby, and have assumed, at your direction and without independent verification, that the Synergies will be realized in the amounts and at
the times projected.

We have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
EarthLink or Windstream, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of EarthLink or Windstream. We have not
evaluated the solvency or fair value of EarthLink, Windstream or the combined company under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at your direction, that the Combination will be consummated in accordance
with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of
obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Combination, no delay,
limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on EarthLink or Windstream or the contemplated
benefits of the Combination. We also have assumed, at your direction, that the Combination will qualify for federal income tax purposes as
a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Combination (other than the Exchange Ratio to the extent expressly
specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Combination. As you are aware, we have not been authorized
by EarthLink or the Board of Directors of EarthLink to solicit, nor have we solicited, interest or proposals from third parties regarding a
possible acquisition of all or any part of EarthLink or any alternative transaction. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to holders of EarthLink Common Stock of the Exchange Ratio provided for in the Merger, and no opinion or view is
expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Combination by the holders of any class of securities, creditors

or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness of the amount, nature or any
other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Combination, or class of such persons,
relative to the Exchange Ratio or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Combination in
comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to EarthLink or in which EarthLink might engage or as to the
underlying business decision of EarthLink to proceed with or effect the Combination. We are not expressing any opinion as to what the
value of Windstream Common Stock actually will be when issued or the prices at which Windstream Common Stock will trade at any
time, including following announcement or consummation of the Combination.

This opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to members of the Board of Directors as to whether they
should approve the Combination or the Merger Agreement, and we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder
should vote or act in connection with the Combination or any related matter.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of EarthLink in connection with the Combination and we have received
retainer fees and will receive fees for our services, a portion of which is payable in connection with our conducting an analysis for
purposes of determining whether we can render an opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the
Combination. In addition, EarthLink has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our
engagement.

We and our affiliates in the past have provided investment banking and other financial services to EarthLink for which we have received
compensation and in the future may provide investment banking and other financial services to EarthLink and Windstream for which we
may receive compensation.

It is understood that this letter is for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of EarthLink (in its capacity as such) in connection with
and for purposes of its evaluation of the Combination and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent, except
that this opinion, may, if required by law, be included in its entirety in any proxy or other information statement or registration statement to
be mailed to stockholders of EarthLink in connection with the Combination.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as they exist and can be
evaluated on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may
affect this opinion, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. The issuance of this opinion was
approved by our Opinion Committee.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that, as
of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio provided for in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of EarthLink
Common Stock.

Very truly yours,

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports
on Form 10-K of the Company and Windstream for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; certain interim reports to stockholders

Company, in each case, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”), including certain operating synergies projected by the
management of the Company to result from the Transaction, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Synergies”); and certain net
operating loss utilization forecasts for the Company and Windstream prepared by the management of the Company and certain net
operating loss utilization forecasts for Windstream pro forma for the Transaction prepared by the management of the Company, in each
case, as approved for our use by the Company (the “NOL Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior

Transaction and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company and Windstream;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares and the shares of Windstream Common Stock; compared certain financial
and stock market information for the Company and Windstream with similar information for certain other companies the securities of

and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the

responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts, including the

other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or Windstream or on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the
Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the
effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

or accounting matters. We were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or

United States

November 5, 2016

Board of Directors 
Windstream Holdings, Inc. 
4001 Rodney Parham Road 
Little Rock, AR 72212

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that Windstream Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) intends to enter into a transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”) with
EarthLink Holdings Corp. (“EarthLink”) pursuant to which (i) Europa Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (“Merger Sub 1”) will merge with and into EarthLink, with EarthLink being the surviving corporation (the “Merger”); (ii)
immediately following the Merger, EarthLink will merge with and into Europa Merger Sub, LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company (“Merger Sub 2”), with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving company; and (iii) upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each of
the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of EarthLink issued and outstanding (other than shares owned by the Company,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or EarthLink) will be converted into the right to receive 0.818 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company. The terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 5, 2016 among the Company, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and EarthLink (the
“Agreement”). The summary of the Proposed Transaction set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement.

We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the Company of the Exchange Ratio to be paid by the Company in the Proposed Transaction. We have not been requested
to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the
Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion on, and our
opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration paid in the Proposed
Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to any other
transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage.

In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) the Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2016, and the specific terms of the
Proposed Transaction; (2) publicly available information concerning the Company and EarthLink that we believe to be relevant to our
analysis, including their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016; (3) drafts of the Company’s and EarthLink’s respective
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016; (4) financial and operating information with respect to
the business, operations and prospects of the Company furnished to us by the Company, including financial projections of the Company
prepared by management of the Company (the “Company Projections”); (5) financial

of the Company’s and EarthLink’s common stock for the last twelve months as of November 3, 2016 and a comparison of those trading
histories with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (8) a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial
condition of the Company and EarthLink with each other and with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (9) a comparison of
the financial terms of the Proposed Transaction with the financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant; (10) the pro
forma impact of the Proposed Transaction on the future financial performance of the combined company, including (i) certain financial
and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the Company on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
Proposed Transaction furnished to us by the Company, including financial projections of the Company on a pro forma basis giving effect
to the Proposed Transaction prepared by management of the Company (the “Pro Forma Projections”) and (ii) cost savings and operating
synergies expected by the management of the Company to result from a combination of the businesses (collectively, the “Expected
Synergies”); (11) published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price targets of
the Company and EarthLink; and (12) the relative contributions of the Company and EarthLink to the future financial performance of the
combined company on a pro forma basis. In addition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning the
Company’s and EarthLink’s businesses, operations, assets, financial conditions and prospects and have undertaken such other studies,
analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used
by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent
verification of such information) and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware
of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the
Company Projections, upon the advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future
financial performance of the Company and that the Company will perform substantially in accordance with such projections. With respect

perform substantially in accordance with such projections. With respect to the Pro Forma Projections, upon the advice and at the
instruction of the Company, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company on a pro
forma basis giving effect to the Proposed Transaction, that the pro forma adjustments to the Company

Projections are appropriate and that the pro forma Company will perform substantially in accordance with such Pro Forma Projections.
With respect to the NOL Projections, upon the advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have assumed that the amounts of the
NOL Projections are reasonable and that the net operating losses contained in the NOL Projections will be realized in accordance with
such estimates. Furthermore, upon the advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have assumed that the amounts and timing of the
Expected Synergies are reasonable and that the Expected Synergies will be realized in accordance with such estimates. We assume no
responsibility for and we express no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving at
our opinion, we have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company or EarthLink and have not made
or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company or EarthLink. Our opinion necessarily is based upon
