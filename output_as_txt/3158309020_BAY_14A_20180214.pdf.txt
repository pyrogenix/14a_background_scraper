OLD LINE BANCSHARES, INC. BAY BANCORP, INC.
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus Merger Proposal – Your Vote is Very Important
 
The boards of directors of Old Line Bancshares, Inc. (“Old Line Bancshares”) and Bay Bancorp, Inc. (“Bay Bancorp”) have agreed to a combination
under the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 27, 2017, pursuant to which Bay Bancorp will be merged with and into
Old Line Bancshares, with Old Line Bancshares surviving the merger.
 
If the merger is completed, Bay Bancorp stockholders will have the right to receive, for each share of Bay Bancorp common stock they own, between
approximately 0.4047 and 0.4600 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock, subject to adjustment. The merger consideration will be adjusted in
connection with Bay Bancorp’s recent settlement of certain litigation and its resolution of certain loans. The merger consideration may also be
adjusted if at any time during the five trading days before the effective date of the merger, the volume-weighted average closing price of Old Line
Bancshares common stock during the 20 prior trading days is less than $24.30 and the decrease in such price from $27.00 is more than 15% lower
than the change in the average of Nasdaq Bank Index prices for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the determination
date (the “Final Index Price”) relative to the Nasdaq Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, which allows Bay Bancorp to terminate the
merger agreement, and Old Line Bancshares exercises its right to prevent Bay Bancorp from so terminating by increasing the merger consideration
(by increasing the number of shares, making a cash payment or a combination of both) so that the per share consideration is an amount that equals
the lesser of (i) $11.178 or (ii) (a) the Final Index Price divided by the Nasdaq Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, multiplied by (b)
0.3910 and the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-weighted average price, divided by (c) the quotient of the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-
weighted average price divided by $27.00. Therefore, the value of the per share and aggregate merger consideration will depend on the market price
of Old Line Bancshares common stock on the closing date of the merger and the applicability and extent of any adjustments. Assuming no
adjustments to the merger consideration under the terms of the merger agreement and no changes in the number of shares of common stock of Bay
Bancorp outstanding, if the merger is completed Old Line Bancshares will issue between approximately 4,337,529 and 4,930,228 shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock (not including cash in lieu of fractional shares and in exchange for outstanding options). Based on anticipated adjustments
relating to Bay Bancorp’s recent settlement of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans, as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, we expect that the value of the per share merger consideration will be increased by approximately $0.15 resulting in an
increase in the exchange ratio of 0.0048; the impact of these adjustments on the number of Old Line Bancshares common stock issued for each share
of Bay Bancorp common stock will vary based on recent trading prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock as of the effective date of the merger,
but based on recent trading prices, if the merger was effective on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, each share of Bay Bancorp
common stock would have been exchanged for 0.4095 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock, or an aggregate of approximately 4,388,975
shares. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares, and options to purchase Bay Bancorp common stock that are outstanding at the effective
date of the merger will be converted into the right to receive cash.
 
After the merger, Old Line Bancshares stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of common stock. Old Line Bancshares common stock
is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “OLBK.” The closing sales price of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock on the Nasdaq
Capital Market on September 27, 2017, immediately prior to the public announcement of the merger, and on February 1, 2018, was $29.31 and
$31.96, respectively.
 
Stockholders of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will be asked to vote on the approval of the merger at a special meeting of the stockholders of
each company. We cannot complete the merger unless we obtain the required approval of the stockholders of each of Old Line Bancshares and Bay
Bancorp. The merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of Old Line
Bancshares and the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of Bay Bancorp. The boards of directors of each of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp recommend that you vote “FOR” approval of the merger.
 
You should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all annexes carefully. Before making a decision on how to vote, you should
consider the “Risk Factors” discussion beginning on page 16 of this document.
 
This joint proxy statement/prospectus incorporates important business and financial information about Old Line Bancshares and Bay
Bancorp from reports they have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). This information is available without
charge at the SEC’s Web site located at www.sec.gov. Old Line Bancshares information is also available upon written request to Old Line
Bancshares, Inc., Attn: Secretary, 1525 Pointer Ridge Place, Bowie, MD 20716, or oral request at (301) 430-2500. Bay Bancorp information

five business days prior to the date of the Old Line Bancshares special meeting, or March 21, 2018, and you must request Bay Bancorp
information no later than five business days prior to the date of the Bay Bancorp special meeting, or March 21, 2018.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

 
The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp, may have regarding the merger

agreement, the merger and the other matters being considered at the special meetings and the answers to those questions. Old Line Bancshares and
Bay Bancorp urge you to read carefully the remainder of this joint proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not
provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger and the other matters being considered at the special meetings.
Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?

A: Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp have agreed to the merger of Bay Bancorp with and into Old Line Bancshares,
which we refer to as the “merger,” pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement that is described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.
Each company will hold a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of voting on the merger and certain related
proposals. This document constitutes each company’s proxy statement, and it also constitutes a prospectus covering the
shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that will be issued to stockholders of Bay Bancorp in the merger.
 
In order to complete the merger, Maryland law requires that the stockholders of each of Old Line Bancshares and Bay
Bancorp vote to approve the merger. In addition, the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) require that Old
Line Bancshares stockholders approve the merger since the shares it will issue to Bay Bancorp stockholders in the merger
will be in excess of 20% of its current outstanding shares of common stock and voting power.
 
In addition, Bay Bancorp stockholders will be asked to adopt a nonbinding advisory resolution approving certain “golden
parachute compensation” that Old Line Bancshares could be required to pay to Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President
and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, in
connection with the merger. Rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), require Bay Bancorp to
seek a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain “golden parachute compensation” that Bay Bancorp’s named
executive officers may receive in connection with the merger.
 
Finally, both Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp stockholders will be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn their
special meetings to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies in the event there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the meetings to approve the matters to be considered by the stockholders.
 
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will hold separate special meetings to obtain these approvals. This joint proxy
statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger and the meetings of the stockholders of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting materials allow you to vote your shares
without actually attending your respective stockholder meeting.
 
Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible.

Q: When and where will the stockholder meetings be held?

A: The Old Line Bancshares special meeting will be held at its office located at 1525 Pointer Ridge Place, Bowie, Maryland,
on March 28, 2018 at 9:00 a.m.  The Bay Bancorp special meeting will be held at its office located at 7151 Columbia
Gateway Drive, Suite A, Columbia, Maryland 21046, on March 28, 2018 at 9:00 a.m.

If you hold shares of common stock of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp in the name of a bank, broker or other
nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to ensure that your shares
are represented and voted at your stockholder meeting.

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal?

A: Old Line Bancshares. The proposal at the Old Line Bancshares special meeting to approve the merger requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock entitled to vote
on the proposal. Therefore, an abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will each have the effect of a vote against
this proposal.
 
As of the record date for the Old Line Bancshares special meeting, there were 12,543,653 shares of Old Line Bancshares
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, and directors and executive officers of Old Line Bancshares and
their affiliates are entitled to vote 8.09% of those shares.
 
Bay Bancorp. The proposal at the Bay Bancorp special meeting to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.
Therefore, an abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will each have the effect of a vote against this proposal.
 
Adoption of the nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute compensation” that may be paid to
Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive
Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority
of all votes cast on the matter at the special meeting. Abstentions, the failure to vote and broker non-votes are not included
in calculating votes cast with respect to this proposal and, therefore, will have no effect on their outcome.
 
As of the record date for the Bay Bancorp special meeting, there were 10,717,889 shares of Bay Bancorp common stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, and directors, executive officers and their affiliates were entitled to vote 34.3%
of such shares. Directors of Bay Bancorp and H Bancorp LLC (“H Bancorp”), who have all agreed, in writing, to vote their
shares of Bay Bancorp common stock in support of the merger, are entitled to vote 33.8% of the shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock that are issued and outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record date.
 
Each of the special meetings may be adjourned, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the shares of common stock cast on the matter at these special meetings is required to adjourn such special meeting.

Q: How do the boards of directors of each of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp recommend that I vote on the
proposals?

A: The board of directors of Old Line Bancshares recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the merger.
 
The board of directors of Bay Bancorp recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the merger and “FOR” adoption of
the nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute compensation” that may be paid to Joseph J. Thomas,
Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President -
Chief Financial Officer, in connection with the merger.

Q: How many votes do I have?

A: Old Line Bancshares. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Old Line Bancshares common stock that you owned as
of the record date.
 
Bay Bancorp. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Bay Bancorp common stock that you owned as of the record
date.

Q: What will happen if I fail to vote or I abstain from voting?

A: A failure to vote, a failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote, and an abstention will all have the same
effect as a vote against the proposal to approve the merger.
 
Assuming a quorum is present, an abstention or the failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal to
approve the adjournment of the stockholder meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies.
 
If you are a Bay Bancorp stockholder, then assuming a quorum is present, an abstention or the failure to vote will have no
effect on the outcome of the proposal to adopt the nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute
compensation” that may be paid to Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D.
Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, in connection with the merger.
 
For these purposes, a quorum will be present at the Old Line Bancshares special meeting if holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock as of the record date are present, in person or by proxy, at
that meeting, and a quorum will be present at the Bay Bancorp special meeting if holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock as of the record date are present, in person or by proxy, at that meeting.

Q: If my shares are held of record by my broker, bank or other nominee (that is, in street name), will my broker, bank
or other nominee automatically vote my shares for me?

A: Generally not.  If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account, your broker will not vote your shares of Old Line
Bancshares or Bay Bancorp common stock unless you provide voting instructions to your broker.  If your shares of Old
Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp common stock are held by a bank or other nominee, whether your nominee may vote your
shares in the absence of instructions from you will depend on your specific arrangement with your nominee record holder,
but in the absence of an arrangement granting such record holder discretionary authority to vote, your record holder
nominee will not have authority to vote your shares of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp common stock on any matter
at your stockholder meeting absent specific voting instructions from you.  You should instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote your shares by following the instructions provided by the broker, bank or nominee with this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.  Please note that you may not vote shares of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp common stock
held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp or by voting in person at the
applicable special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your bank, broker or nominee.

Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?

A: If you sign and return your proxy card without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the Old Line Bancshares
common stock or the Bay Bancorp common stock represented by your proxy will be voted in favor of that proposal.

Q: What if I fail to submit my proxy card or to instruct my broker, bank or other nominee to vote?

A: If you fail to properly submit your proxy card or fail to properly instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock or Bay Bancorp common stock and you do not attend the applicable special
meeting and vote your shares in person, then your shares will not be voted unless your shares are held of record by a non-
broker and you have granted such record holder discretionary authority to vote your shares.  If your shares are not voted,
this will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger, but will have no effect on the proposal to
adjourn the meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies or, with respect to Bay Bancorp, on the adoption of the
nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute” compensation.

Q: If I am a stockholder of record, can I change my vote after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your special meeting. You can do this in one of
three ways:
 

·    you can send a signed notice of revocation;
 
·    you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date; or
 
·    if you are a holder of record or if you hold your shares in street name and receive a valid proxy from your

broker, you can attend your special meeting and vote in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy
previously given, or you may revoke your proxy in person, but your attendance alone will not revoke any
proxy that you have previously given.

 
If you choose either of the first two methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to the Secretary
of Old Line Bancshares or the Corporate Secretary of Bay Bancorp, as appropriate, no later than the beginning of the
applicable special meeting. If your shares are held in street name by your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow
the directions you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee to change your voting instructions, or contact your
broker, bank or other nominee if no such instructions are provided.

Q: What will happen if stockholders of Bay Bancorp do not approve the “golden parachute compensation” that may be
paid to Messrs. Thomas and Pickett in connection with the merger?

A: The vote with respect to the “golden parachute compensation” is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Bay Bancorp
or Old Line Bancshares.  Approval of this compensation is not a condition to completion of the merger.  Therefore, if the
merger is approved and subsequently completed, the compensation will still be paid to Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President - Chief Financial
Officer, assuming they are eligible to receive that compensation, whether or not the stockholders of Bay Bancorp approve
that compensation at their special meeting.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights or similar rights?

A: No.  Neither the stockholders of Old Line Bancshares nor the stockholders of Bay Bancorp have the right to demand the
fair value of their stock or seek an appraisal of such fair value in connection with the merger.  

Q: What are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to stockholders?

A: In general, for United States federal income tax purposes, Bay Bancorp stockholders are not expected to recognize a gain
or loss on the exchange of their shares of Bay Bancorp common stock for shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock.
Bay Bancorp stockholders will recognize a gain in connection with cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock.
 
Old Line Bancshares stockholders will have no tax consequences as a result of the merger.
 
Bay Bancorp stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the
merger to them because tax matters are very complicated and, in many cases, tax consequences of the merger will depend
on your particular facts and circumstances. See “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Certain Federal Income Tax
Consequences.”

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp are working to complete the merger as soon as is reasonably practicable, with a
target date of April 18, 2018.  However, the merger is subject to various federal and state regulatory approvals and other
conditions, in addition to approval by the stockholders of both companies, and it is possible that factors outside the control
of both companies could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all.  There may be a substantial
amount of time between the respective Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp special meetings and the completion of the
merger.

Q: What do I need to do now?

 Carefully read and consider the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including its annexes.  After
you have carefully read these materials, as soon as possible either (i) indicate on the attached proxy card how you want
your shares to be voted, then sign, date and mail the proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope (you may also vote
by phone or via the Internet as otherwise instructed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus), or (ii) if you hold your shares
in street name, follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to direct it how to vote your
shares, so that your shares may be represented and voted at the Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp special meeting.

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A: Old Line Bancshares. You will continue to hold your shares of common stock in Old Line Bancshares after the merger.
 
Bay Bancorp. As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you will receive shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock in exchange for your shares of Bay Bancorp common stock.

Q: Do I need to do anything with my shares of Bay Bancorp common stock now?

A: No. Please do not send in any Bay Bancorp stock certificates with your proxy card. If the merger is approved and your
shares of Bay Bancorp common stock are represented by a stock certificate, then you will be sent a letter of transmittal that
includes instructions for sending in your Bay Bancorp stock certificates stock at a later date. Shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock held in book-entry form will be automatically converted into the applicable merger consideration. As a
result, if you hold your shares of Bay Bancorp common stock in book-entry form, you are not required to take any action in
order for your shares to be exchanged for your applicable portion of the merger consideration.
 
Each outstanding share of common stock of Old Line Bancshares will continue to remain outstanding as a share of Old
Line Bancshares common stock after the merger. As a result, if you are an Old Line Bancshares stockholder, you are not
required to take any action with respect to your Old Line Bancshares common stock certificates.

Q: Whom should I call if I have any questions?

A: Stockholders of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp who have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted
on at the special stockholder meetings or who desire additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or additional
proxy cards should contact:

The Companies
 
Old Line Bancshares, Inc.
 

1525 Pointer Ridge Place
Bowie, Maryland 20716
Telephone: (301) 430-2500
 

Old Line Bancshares was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on April 11, 2003 to serve as the holding company of Old
Line Bank. On May 22, 2003, the stockholders of Old Line Bank approved the reorganization of Old Line Bank into a holding company structure
pursuant to which Old Line Bank became a subsidiary of Old Line Bancshares. The reorganization became effective on September 15, 2003. Old
Line Bancshares is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and subject
to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (the “FRB”) and the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the
“Maryland Commissioner”).

 
On April 1, 2011, Old Line Bancshares acquired Maryland Bankcorp, Inc., the parent company of Maryland Bank & Trust Company, N.A,

on May 10, 2013, Old Line Bancshares acquired WSB Holdings, Inc. (“WSB”), the parent company of The Washington Savings Bank, F.S.B., on
December 4, 2015, Old Line Bancshares acquired Regal Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of Regal Bank & Trust, and on July 28, 2017, Old Line
Bancshares acquired DCB Bancshares, Inc. (“DCB”), the parent company of Damascus Community Bank. Following our latest acquisition, we have
assets of more than $2.0 billion and 28 full service branches serving nine Maryland counties.

 
In addition, Old Line Bank owns 100% of the interest in Pointer Ridge Office Investment, LLC (“Pointer Ridge”). Pointer Ridge owns the

commercial office building in which Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank lease and operate their main headquarters as well as a branch of Old
Line Bank.

 
Old Line Bank is a trust company chartered by the State of Maryland. Old Line Bank was originally chartered in 1989 as a national bank

under the name “Old Line National Bank.” Old Line Bank converted to a Maryland-chartered trust company exercising the powers of a commercial
bank in June 2002, and does not exercise trust powers - its regulatory structure is the same as a Maryland chartered commercial bank. Old Line Bank
is regulated by the Maryland Commissioner and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and is subject to regulation, supervision and
regular examination by the Maryland Commissioner and the FDIC. Old Line Bank’s deposits are insured to the maximum legal limits by the FDIC.
Its current market area consists of the suburban Maryland counties of Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George’s and St. Mary’s
(Washington, D.C. suburbs) and Baltimore and Carroll (Baltimore City suburbs).

 
At December 31, 2017, Old Line Bancshares had consolidated assets, deposits and stockholders’ equity of approximately $2.1 billion, $1.7

billion and $207.7 million, respectively.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Old Line Bancshares will acquire Bay Bancorp by merging Bay Bancorp with and into Old Line

Bancshares. Pursuant to a separate agreement, we anticipate that immediately after the merger, Bay Bank will merge with and into Old Line Bank,
with Old Line Bank being the surviving bank.

 
A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.
 

Consideration to be Received in the Merger (see page 82)
 

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of common stock of Bay Bancorp will be converted into the right to receive shares of Old
Line Bancshares common stock. The number of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock for which each share of Bay Bancorp common stock
will be exchanged in the merger, which we refer to as the “per share consideration,” will be calculated by dividing $11.80 by the volume-weighted
average closing prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock for the 20 trading days ending five trading days before the closing date of the merger
(which we refer to as the “Average Price”), subject to a minimum Average Price of $25.65 and a maximum average price of $29.16 and adjustments
for the after-tax income recognized by Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank from the recent settlement of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans.
We refer to the number resulting from such calculation as the “exchange ratio.” As such, the per share consideration before such adjustments may be
as low as 0.4047 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock if the Average Price is $29.16 or more and as high as 0.4600 shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock if the Average Price is $25.65 or less. The impact of the adjustments will not be calculated until just prior to the effective
time of the merger, but based on current information regarding these adjustments, if the merger had been effective on February 1, 2018, the exchange
ratio would have been increased by 0.0048.

 
In addition, the number of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that will be exchanged for each outstanding share of Bay Bancorp

common stock may be increased if Old Line Bancshares exercises its option to increase the merger consideration to avoid termination of the merger
agreement based on recent closing prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock prior to the merger, as further described below under “– Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp can Amend or Terminate the Merger Agreement.”

 
The exchange ratio is also subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and

similar transactions involving Old Line Bancshares common stock.
 
If the exchange ratio is fixed based on the formula described above (i.e. of the Average Price is above $29.15 or below $25.66), then the

value of the merger consideration will be dependent upon the value of Old Line Bancshares common stock and, therefore, will fluctuate with the
market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock. Accordingly, if the exchange ratio (before adjustments) is fixed, any change in the price of Old
Line Bancshares common stock prior to the merger will affect the market value of the merger consideration that stockholders of Bay Bancorp will
receive as a result of the merger. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Terms of the Merger – What Bay Bancorp
Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger.”

 
Surrender of Stock Certificates and Exchange of Shares (see page 86)
 

No more than five business days following the effective date of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each Bay Bancorp stockholder
whose shares are held in certificated form (i.e. represented by a paper stock certificate) a letter of transmittal containing instructions for use in
surrendering their Bay Bancorp stock certificates in exchange for the merger consideration. Shares of Bay Bancorp common stock held in book-entry
form (i.e., not represented by certificates) will be converted into the merger consideration automatically, without the need for such stockholders to
send in any documentation in order to receive their share of the merger consideration.

 
Do not send in your stock certificates until you receive the letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange agent.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 17/225

 

 
Treatment of Stock Options (see page 85)
 

Options to purchase Bay Bancorp common stock that are outstanding at the effective date of the merger, whether or not then exercisable,
will be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Bay Bancorp common stock
issuable upon the exercise of such option by (ii) the difference between (a) the Average Price multiplied by the per share consideration and (b) the
exercise price per share of Bay Bancorp common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option.

 
Each of the Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp Boards of Directors Recommends Stockholder Approval (see pages 39 and 42)
 

Each of the Old Line Bancshares and the Bay Bancorp boards of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, respectively, and their respective stockholders. Accordingly, the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares
recommends that stockholders of Old Line Bancshares vote “FOR” approval of the merger, and the board of directors of Bay Bancorp recommends
that stockholders of Bay Bancorp vote “FOR” approval of the merger.

 
Opinion of Old Line Bancshares’ Financial Advisor (see page 57)
 

In connection with the merger, Old Line Bancshares’ financial advisor, FIG Partners, LLC (“FIG”), delivered a written opinion, dated
September 27, 2017, to the Old Line Bancshares board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion,
to the holders of Old Line Bancshares common stock of the merger consideration to be paid by Old Line Bancshares to the stockholders of Bay
Bancorp in the proposed merger. The full text of the opinion, which describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by FIG in preparing the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Old Line Bancshares board of directors (in its capacity
as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion did not address the underlying business
decision of Old Line Bancshares to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Old Line
Bancshares board in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Old Line Bancshares
common stock as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter.

 
Opinions of Bay Bancorp’s Financial Advisors (see pages 66 and 73)
 

In connection with the merger, each of Bay Bancorp’s financial advisors, RP® Financial, LC. (“RP Financial”) and Hovde Group, LLC
(“Hovde Group”), delivered a written opinion, dated September 27, 2017, to the Bay Bancorp board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of Bay Bancorp common stock of the merger consideration in the proposed merger. The
full text of the opinions, which describe the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by RP Financial and Hovde Group in preparing their opinions, are attached as Annexes C and D, respectively, to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The opinions were for the information of, and were directed to, the Bay Bancorp board of directors (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinions did not address the underlying business decision
of Bay Bancorp to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Bay Bancorp board in
connection with the merger, and they do not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Bay Bancorp common stock as to how to vote in
connection with the merger or any other matter.

 
Vote Required by Old Line Bancshares Stockholders (see page 40)
 

The approval of the merger by stockholders of Old Line Bancshares requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of Old
Line Bancshares common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the record date of January 31, 2018. Each holder of shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock outstanding on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held. The vote required for approval of the
merger is a percentage of all outstanding shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock. Therefore, an abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-
vote will each have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger.

 
The affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock present in person or represented by

proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to
permit further solicitation of proxies in the event that there are no sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to approve the merger. Therefore, an
abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will each have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.

Vote Required by Bay Bancorp Stockholders (see page 43)
 

The approval of the merger by stockholders of Bay Bancorp requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of
Bay Bancorp common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the record date of January 31, 2018. Each holder of shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock outstanding on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held. The vote required for approval of the merger is a
percentage of all outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock. Therefore, an abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will each have
the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger.

 
The affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the shares of Bay Bancorp common stock present in person or represented by proxy at

the special meeting and entitled to vote is required to adopt the nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute compensation” that
could be paid to Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice
President - Chief Financial Officer, in connection with the merger. Therefore, an abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will each have no
effect on the outcome of this proposal.

 
The affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the shares of Bay Bancorp common stock present in person or represented by proxy at

the special meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit
further solicitation of proxies in the event that there are no sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to approve the merger. Therefore, an abstention,
a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will each have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ Directors have Approved the Merger and are Expected to Vote in Favor of the Merger (see page 40)
 

The directors of Old Line Bancshares have approved the merger agreement and the merger and are expected to vote for approval of the
merger. Directors of Old Line Bancshares have sole or shared voting power over 1,015,019 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock, or
approximately 8.09% of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock outstanding as of the record date.

 
Bay Bancorp’s Directors have Agreed to Vote in Favor of the Merger (see pages 43 and 103)
 

As of the record date for the Bay Bancorp special meeting, there were 10,717,889 shares of Bay Bancorp common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote. The directors and largest stockholder of Bay Bancorp have agreed, in writing, to vote all shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock for which they are the record or beneficial owner “FOR” the approval of the merger. As of the record date, such directors and
stockholder together are entitled to vote 33.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock.

 
Bay Bancorp’s Directors and Management may have Interests in the Merger that Differ from Your Interests (see page 101)
 

The directors and executive officers of Bay Bancorp have interests in the merger as directors and employees that are different from your
interests as a Bay Bancorp stockholder. These interests include, among others, provisions in the merger agreement regarding Old Line Bancshares
and Old Line Bank board positions, payments to be made to Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President -
Chief Financial Officer pursuant to their existing employment agreements, as well as indemnification and insurance provisions included in the
merger agreement. In addition, Steven D. Hovde, a director of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, is also the President and Chief Financial Officer of
Hovde Group, which served as a financial advisor to Bay Bancorp and will receive investment banking fees from Bay Bancorp in connection with
the merger.

 
Bay Bancorp’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them in approving and recommending the merger agreement,

the merger and the related transactions.

Regulatory Approval Must be Obtained and Other Conditions Must be Satisfied Before the Merger can be Completed (see pages 98 and 93)
 

Old Line Bancshares’ and Bay Bancorp’s obligations to complete the merger are subject to various conditions that are usual and customary
for this kind of transaction, including obtaining approval from the FRB and the Maryland Commissioner for the merger, obtaining approval of the
FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner for the bank merger and providing notification to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”)
for the bank merger (which are included in any references to regulatory “approvals” in this joint proxy statement/prospectus). Old Line Bancshares
and/or Old Line Bank filed the appropriate applications for approval with the FRB, the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner on November 21,
2017. Bay Bank filed the appropriate notice with the OCC on November 21, 2017. As a result of the merger, the parties expect that the shares of Bay
Bancorp common stock owned by H Bancorp, the top-tier holding company of Bay Bank, will be converted into a number of shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock that will exceed 5.0% of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock outstanding following the merger. H Bancorp
must obtain the FRB’s consent to such acquisition, and it filed the required application on January 22, 2018.

 
In addition to the required regulatory approvals, the merger will be completed only if certain conditions, including the following, are

satisfied or waived by the companies:
 
· Old Line Bancshares’ and Bay Bancorp’s stockholders must approve the merger;

 
· No more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock have been qualified for appraisal rights under Maryland

law;
 

· Each party must receive an opinion from its counsel that:
 

Ø the merger constitutes a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Internal Revenue Code”); and

 
Ø with respect to the opinion received by Bay Bancorp, any gain realized in the merger will be recognized only to the extent of

cash or other property (other than Old Line Bancshares common stock) received in the merger, including cash received in lieu
of fractional share interests; and

 
· Each party’s representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement must be correct except to the extent that any untrue or

incorrect representation or warranty would not have a material adverse effect on the party or the party’s ability to consummate the
merger (with certain exceptions), and each party must have performed all of its obligations set forth in the merger agreement.

 
The merger agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A describes all of the conditions that must be met before

the merger may be completed.
 

Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp can Amend or Terminate the Merger Agreement (see page 95)
 

Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares may agree to terminate the merger agreement and not complete the merger at any time before the
merger is completed. Each company also may unilaterally terminate the merger agreement in certain circumstances, including if:

 
· The merger is not completed on or prior to April 30, 2018 or, because of the failure to obtain any required regulatory approval or consent

by such date, the merger is not completed by June 30, 2018, if the failure to complete the merger by that date is not due to a material
breach of the merger agreement by the party seeking to terminate it.

 
· There has been a definitive written denial of a required regulatory approval or consent, or the permanent withdrawal of an application for

approval or consent at the request of a regulatory authority.
 

 12  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 20/225

 

 
· Any required regulatory approval or consent is granted but contains or would result in the imposition of a Burdensome Condition, as

defined in the merger agreement, and there is no meaningful possibility that such consent or approval could be revised prior to June 30,
2018 so as not to contain or result in a Burdensome Condition.

 
· The other party has materially breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in the merger agreement, and such

breach either by its nature cannot be cured prior to the closing of the merger or remains uncured 30 days after receipt by such party of
written notice of such breach (provided that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period but may reasonably be
cured within 60 days and cure is being diligently pursued, then termination can occur only after expiration of such 60-day period), if the
party terminating the merger agreement is not in material breach.

 
· The other party’s board of directors withdraws its recommendation to stockholders to approve the merger.

 
· Old Line Bancshares’ or Bay Bancorp’s stockholders vote on but fail to approve the merger.

 
· Any rule, regulation, order, etc., permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions

contemplated by the merger agreement has become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate the merger
agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and remove such rule, regulation, order, etc.

 
In addition, Bay Bancorp may terminate the merger agreement if:
 
· Bay Bancorp or any Bay Bancorp subsidiary receives, at any time prior to the Bay Bancorp special meeting, an acquisition proposal

from a third party, Bay Bancorp’s board of directors determines that the transaction pursuant to such proposal is more favorable to the
stockholders of Bay Bancorp than the merger, which we refer to a superior Bay Bancorp transaction, and Bay Bancorp complies with
certain conditions applicable to such termination right (see “Terms of the Merger – No Solicitation of Other Transactions” on page 94).

 
· Old Line Bancshares or any Old Line Bancshares subsidiary enters into a definitive term sheet, letter of intent, agreement or similar

agreement to merge, as a result of which Old Line Bancshares is not the surviving entity or Old Line Bancshares’ directors as of
September 27, 2017 do not comprise the majority of the surviving entity’s board of directors, with any person other than Bay Bancorp,
and the Bay Bancorp board of directors determines, after considering the advice of counsel and its financial advisors, that such
transaction is not in the best interests of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders.

 
· If at any time during the five trading days before the effective date of the merger, the volume-weighted average closing price of Old Line

Bancshares common stock during the 20 prior trading days is less than 90% of $27.00, and the decrease in such price is more than 15%
lower than the change in the average of Nasdaq Bank Index prices for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to
the determination date (the “Final Index Price”) relative to the Nasdaq Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, provided,
however, that Old Line Bancshares would then have the option to increase the per share consideration (by increasing the exchange ratio,
making a cash payment or a combination of both) so that the per share consideration is an amount that equals the lesser of (i) the product
of $27.00, 90% and the exchange ratio (which at that point would be 0.4600) or (ii) (a) the Final Index Price divided by the Nasdaq Bank
Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, multiplied by (b) 85%, the exchange ratio (which at that point would be 0.4600) and the
Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-weighted average price, divided by (c) the quotient of the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-
weighted average price divided by $27.00, in which case no termination will take place (the “Walk-Away Cure Right”).

Finally, Old Line Bancshares may terminate the merger agreement if:
 
· Bay Bancorp or any subsidiary of Bay Bancorp enters into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar instrument

with respect to any superior proposal or approves or resolves to approve any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar
instrument with respect to a superior Bay Bancorp transaction.

 
· Bay Bancorp’s board of directors authorizes, recommends or publicly proposes, or publicly announces an intention to authorize,

recommend or propose an agreement to enter into a superior Bay Bancorp transaction.
 

Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp can agree to amend the merger agreement in any way. Either company can waive any of the
requirements of the other company in the merger agreement, except that neither company can waive the requirement that the companies receive all
required regulatory approvals, the requirements for stockholder approval or the requirement that no law, order, decree or injunction preventing the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has been enacted or issued.

 
Old Line Bancshares Must Pay a Termination Fee to Bay Bancorp if the Merger Agreement is Terminated Under Certain Circumstances (see
page 96)
 

Old Line Bancshares has agreed to pay a termination fee of $5,076,000 to Bay Bancorp if Bay Bancorp terminates the merger agreement
because:

 
· Old Line Bancshares has materially breached the merger agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement

contained therein;
 

· The merger failed to close before April 30, 2018 or, if due solely to the need to obtain a regulatory approval or consent, June 30, 2018, or
the parties failed to receive all regulatory approvals and consents required for the merger, and such failure resulted from the knowing,
willful and intentional actions or inactions of Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank (provided that Bay Bancorp is not then in material
breach of any material representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement); or

 
· The board of directors of Old Line Bancshares has withdrawn, changed or modified its recommendation to the stockholders of Old Line

Bancshares to approve the merger in a manner adverse to Bay Bancorp (provided that Bay Bancorp is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement).

 
Bay Bancorp Must Pay a Termination Fee to Old Line Bancshares if the Merger Agreement is Terminated Under Certain Circumstances (see
page 97)
 

Bay Bancorp must pay Old Line Bancshares a termination fee equal to $5,076,000 if the merger agreement is terminated because:
 
· Bay Bancorp has materially breached the merger agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained

therein, including the negative covenants with respect to soliciting, entertaining or pursuing an acquisition proposal;
 

· The merger failed to close before April 30, 2018 or, if due solely to the need to obtain a regulatory approval or consent, June 30, 2018, or
the parties failed to receive all regulatory approvals and consents required for the merger, and such failure resulted from the knowing,
willful and intentional actions or inactions of Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank (provided that Old Line Bancshares is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement);

 
· Bay Bancorp or any Bay Bancorp subsidiary has received an acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior Bay Bancorp transaction; or

 
· The board of directors of Bay Bancorp has withdrawn, changed or modified its recommendation to the stockholders of Bay Bancorp to

approve the merger in a manner adverse to Old Line Bancshares or authorizes, recommends or publicly proposes, or publicly announces
an intention to authorize, recommend or propose, an agreement to enter into a superior Bay Bancorp transaction (provided that Old Line
Bancshares is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger
agreement).

Rights of Old Line Bancshares Stockholders Differ from those of Bay Bancorp Stockholders (see page 108)
 

When the merger is completed, Bay Bancorp stockholders will become Old Line Bancshares stockholders. The rights of Old Line
Bancshares stockholders differ from the rights of Bay Bancorp stockholders in certain important ways. These differences have to do with provisions
in Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation and bylaws that differ from the provisions in Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation and bylaws.

 
Stockholders do not have Appraisal Rights in Connection with the Merger (see page 107)
 

The merger will not entitle a stockholder of Old Line Bancshares or of Bay Bancorp who objects to the merger to demand and receive the
fair value of his or her stock or seek an appraisal to determine such fair value.

RISK FACTORS

 
In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the caption

“Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for approval
of the merger.

 
Risk Factors Related to the Merger in General
 

Old Line Bancshares may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on
Old Line Bancshares’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Old Line Bancshares and Bay
Bancorp. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, however, Old Line Bancshares must successfully combine the businesses of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp. If Old Line Bancshares is unable to successfully combine the businesses of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, the
anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

 
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp have operated, and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is

possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of key depositors or other bank customers and the disruption
of each company’s ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect Old Line Bancshares’
and Bay Bancorp’s ability to maintain their relationships with their respective clients, customers, depositors and employees, which could have a
negative impact on Old Line Bancshares’ ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies
may, to some extent, also divert management’s attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp during such transition period.

 
The opinions of Old Line Bancshares’ and Bay Bancorp’s financial advisors will not reflect changes in circumstances between the

signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger. Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp obtained opinions from their respective
financial advisors regarding the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view, but these opinions are dated as of, and speak only
as of, the date of the merger agreement. Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp have not obtained updated opinions from their respective financial
advisors as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations and prospects of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp,
general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp, and on which the
opinions of Old Line Bancshares’ and Bay Bancorp’s financial advisors were based, may significantly alter the value of Bay Bancorp or the prices of
the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock or Bay Bancorp common stock by the time the merger is completed. The opinions do not speak as
of the time the merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. Because Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp do
not currently anticipate asking their respective financial advisors to update their opinions, the opinions will not address the fairness of the merger
consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed. The recommendation of Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors
that Old Line Bancshares stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the merger and the recommendation of Bay Bancorp’s board of directors that Bay
Bancorp stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the merger, however, are made as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a
description of the opinions that Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp received from their respective financial advisors, refer to the section of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement and the Merger” under the headings “Opinion of Old Line Bancshares’ Financial
Advisor,” “Opinion of RP Financial - Bay Bancorp’s Financial Advisor” and “Opinion of Hovde Group - Bay Bancorp’s Financial Advisor.”

 
Because the market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock will fluctuate, Bay Bancorp stockholders cannot be sure of the value of

the merger consideration they may receive. Upon completion of the merger, the outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock will be converted
into the right to receive shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock. The value of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock to be received
in the merger approximates $11.80 per share, prior to any adjustments, as of the date of the merger agreement based on then-recent trading prices.
Trading prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock may, however, vary from the trading prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock on the date
of the merger agreement, the trading date following the date we announced the merger, the date this joint proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp stockholders and the date of the special meetings of the Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp stockholders.
Any change in the market price of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock may affect the value of the merger consideration that Bay Bancorp
stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and
economic conditions, changes in our respective businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond
our control. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock.

Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on the business, financial
condition and results of operations of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp. These uncertainties may impair Old Line Bancshares’ and Bay
Bancorp’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, depositors and borrowers pending the consummation of the merger, as such personnel,
depositors and borrowers may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the merger. Additionally, these
uncertainties could cause customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers, vendors and others who deal with Old Line Bancshares or Bay
Bancorp to seek to change existing business relationships with Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp or fail to extend an existing relationship. In
addition, competitors may target each company’s existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result
from the merger.

 
Further, the pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration in connection therewith may place a burden on each of Old Line

Bancshares’ and Bay Bancorp’s management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business
concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on each company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

 
In addition, the merger agreement restricts Bay Bancorp from taking certain actions without Old Line Bancshares’ consent while the merger

is pending. These restrictions may, among other matters, prevent Bay Bancorp from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, selling
assets, incurring indebtedness, engaging in significant capital expenditures in excess of certain limits set forth in the merger agreement, entering into
other transactions or making other changes to Bay Bancorp’s business prior to consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.
These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on Bay Bancorp’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see “The
Merger Agreement and the Merger – Terms of the Merger – Conduct of Business Pending the Merger” for a description of these restrictions.

 
The market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock may decline as a result of the merger. The market price of Old Line Bancshares

common stock may decline as a result of the merger if Old Line Bancshares does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger or the effect of the
merger on Old Line Bancshares’ financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition, upon
completion of the merger, Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp stockholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded
business with a different mix of assets, risks and liabilities. Existing Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp stockholders may not wish to continue to
invest in the combined company, or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their shares of the combined company.

 
The market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the

shares of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp currently. The businesses of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp differ and, accordingly, the
results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company’s shares of common stock may be affected by factors
different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of common stock of each of Old Line Bancshares and
Bay Bancorp.

 
If the merger is not completed, Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the

expected benefits. Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the execution of the merger
agreement and the merger. The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction of specified conditions, including the receipt of required
regulatory approvals and the requisite approval of the stockholders of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp. There is no guarantee that these
conditions will be met. If the merger is not completed, these expenses could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of Old Line
Bancshares and/or Bay Bancorp because they would not have realized the expected benefits for which these expenses were incurred.

 
Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or impose conditions that are not presently anticipated. Before

the merger may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the FRB, the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner; in addition, the OCC
must receive notice of the bank merger. The required regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, and
may contain conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger that are not anticipated or that have a material
adverse effect. Although Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there
can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing
additional costs on or limiting the revenues of Old Line Bancshares following the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on Old
Line Bancshares following the merger. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory
approvals, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may also be materially
adversely affected. Further, Old Line Bancshares is not obligated to complete the merger if the regulatory approvals received in connection with the
completion of the merger include any conditions or requirements that, in the reasonable opinion of its board of directors, would (i) so materially and
adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Old Line Bancshares following the merger as to render consummation of the merger
inadvisable, or (ii) materially impair the value of Bay Bancorp to Old Line Bancshares, although Old Line Bancshares could choose to waive this
condition.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 25/225

 

 
Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and future businesses and financial results of Old Line

Bancshares and Bay Bancorp. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may be adversely
affected and Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will be subject to several risks, including the following:

 
· Old Line Bancshares may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Bay Bancorp a termination fee of $5,076,000 under the

merger agreement;
 

· Bay Bancorp may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Old Line Bancshares a termination fee of $5,076,000 under the
merger agreement;

 
· Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is

completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;
 

· Under the merger agreement, Bay Bancorp is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the merger,
which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and

 
· Matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp

management that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Old Line Bancshares or Bay
Bancorp as independent companies, as the case may be.

 
In addition, if the merger is not completed, Old Line Bancshares and/or Bay Bancorp may experience negative reactions from the financial

markets and from their respective stockholders, customers and employees. Old Line Bancshares and/or Bay Bancorp also could be subject to
litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp to
perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp cannot
assure their stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock
prices of Old Line Bancshares and/or Bay Bancorp.

 
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may choose not to proceed with the merger if it is not completed before April 30, 2018 or, if due

to the lack of a required regulatory approval, June 30, 2018. Either Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp may terminate the merger agreement if
the merger has not been completed before April 30, 2018 or, if due to the lack of a required regulatory approval, June 30, 2018. See “The Merger
Agreement and the Merger – Terms of the Merger – Termination.” There can be no assurance that all conditions to the merger will have been
satisfied by the required date(s). See “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Terms of the Merger – Conditions to the Merger.”

 
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may waive one or more of the conditions to the merger without re-soliciting stockholder

approval. Each of the conditions to the obligations of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp to complete the merger may be waived, in whole or in
part, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by agreement of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, if the condition is a condition to both parties’
obligation to complete the merger, or by the party for which such condition is a condition of its obligation to complete the merger. The boards of
directors of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may evaluate the materiality of any such waiver to determine whether amendment of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and re-solicitation of proxies is necessary. Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, however, generally do not expect any
such waiver to be significant enough to require re-solicitation of Old Line Bancshares’ or Bay Bancorp’s stockholders. In the event that any such
waiver is not determined to be significant enough to require re-solicitation of Old Line Bancshares’ or Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, the companies
will have the discretion to complete the merger without seeking further stockholder approval.

Pending litigation related to the merger may delay or prevent the merger and could cause Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp to

incur significant costs and expenses. As discussed in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Litigation Related to the Merger,”
Adam Franchi, both individually and on behalf of a putative class of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the District of Maryland against Bay Bancorp and its directors as well as Old Line Bancshares. The complaint asks the Court, among other
things, to enjoin the parties from proceeding with the merger based, primarily, on allegations that the version of the joint proxy statement/prospectus
that was filed with the SEC on November 22, 2017 omitted certain material information in violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. If the merger is consummated prior to the time these claims are
adjudicated, then the plaintiff has asked the Court to rescind the merger and set it aside or award rescissory damages. This litigation could delay or
even prevent the merger and will likely cause Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares to incur significant legal fees and other costs to defend the
claims, which could adversely impact the financial condition and results of operations of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares, both before and
after the merger. No assurance can be given that Old Line Bancshares, Bay Bancorp or the directors of Bay Bancorp would be successful in the
defense of these claims.

 
Risk Factors Relating to Old Line Bancshares’ Business and Its Common Stock
 
This section discusses risks relating to Old Line Bancshares’ business and includes risks it will continue to face after the merger. References

to “Old Line Bancshares” include its subsidiary Old Line Bank as the context requires.
 
System failure or cybersecurity breaches of Old Line Bancshares’ network security could subject it to increased operating costs as well

as litigation and other potential losses. Old Line Bancshares relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. The
computer systems and network infrastructure it uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues. Old Line Bancshares’
operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a
similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in Old Line Bancshares’ operations could have an adverse effect on its
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Old Line Bancshares’ operations are dependent upon its ability to protect the computer
systems and network infrastructure it uses, including its Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches
and other disruptive problems caused by Internet problems, other users or unrelated third parties. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions
would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through Old Line Bancshares’ computer systems and network infrastructure,
which may result in significant liability to Old Line Bancshares, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage its reputation, result in a loss of
customers, and inhibit current and potential customers from using its Internet banking services, any or all of which could have a material adverse
effect on Old Line Bancshares’ results of operations and financial condition. Old Line Bancshares periodically reviews its security protocols and, as
necessary, adds additional security measures to its computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity breaches,
including firewalls and penetration testing. These precautions may not, however, be effective in preventing such breaches, damage or failures. Old
Line Bancshares continues to monitor developments in this area and consider whether additional protective measures are necessary or appropriate,
and has obtained insurance protection intended to cover losses due to network security breaches; there is no guarantee, however, that such insurance
would cover all costs associated with any breach, damage or failure of Old Line Bancshares’ computer systems and network infrastructure.

 
Old Line Bancshares relies on certain external vendors. Old Line Bancshares’ business is dependent on the use of outside service

providers that support its day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. Old Line Bancshares’ operations are
exposed to the risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in their agreements with
Old Line Bancshares for any number of reasons including equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial
condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While Old Line Bancshares
has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection to performance
monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to its business,
which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of its operations.

 
A worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect Old Line Bancshares’ results of operations and financial condition. Changes

in prevailing economic conditions, including declining real estate values, changes in interest rates that may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads,
adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events may adversely affect
Old Line Bancshares’ financial results. Old Line Bancshares continues to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. Economic
growth continues to be slow and uneven. A return to recessionary conditions or prolonged stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions could
significantly affect the markets in which Old Line Bancshares does business, the demand for its products and services, the value of its loans and
investments, and its ongoing operations, costs and profitability. In any case, Old Line Bancshares expects that the business environment in the State
of Maryland and the entire United States will continue to present challenges for the foreseeable future. Further continuing economic uncertainty,
including regarding concerns about U.S. debt levels and related governmental actions, potential tariffs on imports into the United States and cuts in
government spending, may negatively impact economic conditions going forward. In addition, an increase in unemployment levels may result in
higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in Old Line Bancshares’ nonperforming and criticized classified assets and a decline in demand
for its products and services. These events may cause Old Line Bancshares to incur losses and may adversely affect its financial condition and results
of operations.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 27/225

 

 
Although the adverse economic climate during the past several years has not severely impacted Old Line Bancshares due to its strict

underwriting standards, any adverse changes in the economy going forward, including decreases in current real estate values, increased
unemployment or the economy moving back into a recession, could have a negative effect on the ability its borrowers to make timely repayments of
their loans, which would have an adverse impact on Old Line Bancshares’ earnings.

 
Furthermore, the FRB, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has among other things kept interest rates low through its targeted federal

funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. If the FRB continues to increase the federal funds rate in the near term,
overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic growth. In addition, deflationary
pressures, while possibly lowering Old Line Bancshares’ operating costs, could have a negative impact on its borrowers, especially its business
borrowers, and the values of collateral securing its loans, which could negatively affect its financial performance.

 
A worsening of credit markets and economic conditions could adversely affect Old Line Bancshares’ liquidity. Old Line Bank must

maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure cash flow is available to satisfy current and future financial obligations including demand for loans and deposit
withdrawals, funding of operating costs and other corporate purposes. Old Line Bancshares obtains funding through deposits and various short term
and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased, unsecured borrowings, brokered certificates of deposits and borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the “FHLB”) and others. Economic uncertainty and disruptions in the financial system may adversely
affect Old Line Bancshares’ liquidity. Dramatic declines in the housing market and falling real estate prices coupled with increased foreclosures and
unemployment, resulted in significant asset value write downs by financial institutions during and after the last U.S. recession, including government
sponsored entities and investment banks. These investment write downs caused financial institutions to seek additional capital. Should Old Line
Bancshares experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or should disruptions in the financial markets restrict its funding, it would
negatively impact Old Line Bancshares’ liquidity. To mitigate this risk, Old Line Bancshares closely monitors its liquidity, maintains a line of credit
with the Federal Home Loan Bank and has received approval to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ concentrations of loans in various categories may also increase the risk of credit losses. Old Line Bancshares

currently invests more than 25% of its capital in various loan types and industry segments, including commercial real estate loans and loans to the
hospitality industry (hotels/motels). While declines in the local commercial real estate market following the last recession have not caused the
collateral securing Old Line Bancshares’ loans to exceed acceptable loan to value ratios, a deterioration in the commercial real estate market could
cause deterioration in the collateral securing these loans and/or a decline in its customers’ earning capacity. This could negatively impact Old Line
Bancshares. Although Old Line Bancshares has made a large portion of its hospitality loans to long-term, well-established operators in strategic
locations, a decline in the occupancy rate in these facilities could negatively impact their earnings. This could adversely impact the operators’ ability
to repay their loans, which would adversely impact Old Line Bancshares’ net income.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ need to comply with extensive and complex governmental regulation could have an adverse effect on its business

and growth strategy, and it may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The banking industry is subject to extensive regulation
by state and federal banking authorities. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public or the FDIC insurance funds, not
stockholders. Regulatory requirements affect Old Line Bancshares’ lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability
to attract and retain personnel and many other aspects of its business. These requirements may constrain Old Line Bancshares’ rate of growth and
changes in regulations could adversely affect it. The cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect Old Line Bancshares’
ability to operate profitably. Further, if Old Line Bancshares is not in compliance with such requirements, it could be subject to fines or other
regulatory action that could restrict its ability to operate or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition. Although
Old Line Bancshares believes it is in material compliance with all applicable regulations, it is possible there are violations of which it is unaware that
could be discovered by its regulators in the course of an examination or otherwise, which could trigger such fines or other adverse consequences.

In addition, because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, Old Line

Bancshares cannot forecast how federal or state regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact its operations. In light of the
performance of and government intervention in the financial sector, there may be significant changes to the banking and financial institutions’
regulatory agencies in the future. Changes in regulation and oversight, including in the form of changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies
or changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the services and products Old Line Bancshares offers,
increase its operating expenses, increase compliance challenges and otherwise adversely impact its financial performance and condition. In addition,
the burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and Old Line Bank specifically, at a competitive disadvantage
compared to less regulated competitors.

 
Non-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.

Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being
used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to
establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply
with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly
litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-
compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government has previously imposed laws and regulations relating to residential and
consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. While Old Line Bancshares has developed policies
and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be
effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.

 
Requirements to hold more capital could have a material adverse impact on us. The impact of the revised capital rules on our financial

condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule for the Basel III
capital framework. These rules substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us and increased the minimum levels of
capital we are required to hold, as discussed in “Item 1. Business – Supervision and Regulation – Capital Adequacy Guidelines.” The rules apply to
Old Line Bancshares as well as to Old Line Bank. These rules include a capital conservation buffer that phases in over a period of years that began in
2016 and will become fully effective in 2019. Failure to satisfy the additional capital requirements of the capital conservation buffer will result in
limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. The rules establish a maximum percentage of eligible
retained income that may be utilized for such actions if the capital requirements of the buffer are not fully satisfied. As of January 1, 2017, our capital
requirements with the applicable capital conservation buffer are (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 5.75%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based
capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) ratio of 7.25% and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 9.25%. The capital
conservation buffer does not apply to our leverage ratio requirement, which will remain at 4.0%. Once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased
in, the resulting requirements will be a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-
based capital ratio of 10.5%. These increased capital requirements may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations, or
the failure to satisfy such requirements may result in our inability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock, which could also
negatively impact the market price for our stock, and may negatively impact our ability to retain personnel if our ability to pay retention bonuses is
compromised.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Old Line Bancshares’ management regularly reviews

and updates its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls,
however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the
system are met. Any (i) failure or circumvention of Old Line Bancshares’ controls and procedures, (ii) failure by Old Line Bancshares to adequately
address any internal control deficiencies, or (iii) failure by Old Line Bancshares to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could
have a material effect on Old Line Bancshares’ business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ business may be adversely affected by increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes. As a financial

institution, Old Line Bancshares is subject to risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other
financial crimes have increased. Old Line Bancshares believes it has controls in place to detect and prevent such losses, but in some cases multi-party
collusion or other sophisticated methods of hiding fraud may not be readily detected or detectable, and could result in losses that affect its financial
condition and results of Old Line Bancshares’ operations.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 29/225

 

 
Financial crime is not limited to the financial services industry. Old Line Bancshares’ customers could experience fraud in their businesses,

which could materially impact their ability to repay their loans, and deposit customers in all financial institutions are constantly and unwittingly
solicited by others in fraud schemes that vary from easily detectable and obvious attempts to high-level and very complex international schemes that
could drain an account of millions of dollars and require detailed financial forensics to unravel. While Old Line Bancshares has controls in place,
contractual agreements with its customers partitioning liability, and insurance to help mitigate the risk, none of these are guarantees that it will not
experience a loss, potentially a loss that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, reputation and results of its operations.

 
The level of Old Line Bancshares’ commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny. The FDIC, the

FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial
institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under this guidance, a financial institution that, like Old Line Bancshares, is
actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a
concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land
represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm non-residential properties, loans for
construction, land development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to
commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial
real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the
commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The
purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real
estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management
oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing.
Old Line Bancshares has concluded that it has a concentration in commercial real estate lending under the foregoing standards because its balance in
commercial real estate loans at September 30, 2017 represents more than 300% of total capital. While Old Line Bancshares believes that it has
implemented policies and procedures with respect to its commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could
require it to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to
Old Line Bancshares.

 
Old Line Bancshares depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about its clients and counterparties and its financial

condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information. In deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions
with clients and counterparties, Old Line Bancshares may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including
financial statements and other financial information, which it does not independently verify as a matter of course. Old Line Bancshares also may rely
on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on
reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, Old Line Bancshares may assume that a customer’s
audited financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Old Line Bancshares’ financial condition and results of
operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.

 
Old Line Bancshares may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are

interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Old Line Bancshares has exposure to many different industries and
counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and
dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose Old Line Bancshares to credit risk in the event of a
default by a counterparty or client. In addition, Old Line Bancshares’ credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Old Line Bank
cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to Old Line Bank.
Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Old Line Bancshares’ financial condition and results of operations.

9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 30/225

 

 
Regulations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact Old Line Bancshares’ results of operations, liquidity or financial

condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) represents a comprehensive overhaul of the
U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal agencies to issue many
new and significant rules and regulations to implement its various provisions. There are a number of regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that have
not yet been fully adopted and implemented and Old Line Bancshares will not know the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on its business until such
regulations are fully implemented. As a result, Old Line Bancshares cannot predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact its
business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with these laws and regulations may require Old Line Bancshares to make changes
to its business and operations and will likely result in additional costs and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities, any of
which may adversely impact its results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

 
Because Old Line Bancshares serves a limited market area in Maryland, an economic downturn in its market area could more adversely

affect Old Line Bancshares than it affects its larger competitors that are more geographically diverse. Old Line Bancshares’ current market area
consists of the suburban Maryland counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George’s and St. Mary’s. If
the merger is consummated this market area will expand into Frederick County, Maryland, and Old Line Bancshares may expand in contiguous
northern and western Counties, such as Howard County, Maryland. Broad geographic diversification, however, is not currently part of Old Line
Bancshares’ community bank focus. Overall, during and following the most recent recession, the business environment has negatively impacted
many businesses and households in the United States and worldwide. Although the economic decline has not impacted the suburban Maryland and
Washington D.C. suburbs as adversely as other areas of the United States, it has caused an increase in unemployment and business failures and a
decline in property values. As a result, if Old Line Bancshares’ market area should suffer another economic downturn, it may more severely affect its
business and financial condition than it affects larger bank competitors. In particular, due to the proximity of its market area to Washington, D.C.,
decreases in spending by the Federal government or threatened cuts to Federal government employment could impact Old Line Bancshares to a
greater degree than banking companies that serve a larger or a different geographical area. Old Line Bancshares’ larger competitors, for example,
serve more geographically diverse market areas, parts of which may not be affected by the same economic conditions that may exist in Old Line
Bancshares’ market area. Further, unexpected changes in the national and local economy may adversely affect Old Line Bancshares’ ability to attract
deposits and to make loans. Such risks are beyond Old Line Bancshares’ control and may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and
results of operations and, in turn, the value of its common stock.

 
Old Line Bancshares originates and retains in its portfolio residential mortgage loans. A downturn in the local real estate market and

economy could adversely affect its earnings. Old Line Bancshares’ loan portfolio includes residential mortgage loans that it originates. Although the
local real estate market and economy in Old Line Bancshares’ market areas have performed better than many other markets during the past few
years, a downturn could cause higher unemployment and more delinquencies, and could adversely affect the value of properties securing its loans. In
addition, the real estate market may take longer to recover or not recover to previous levels. These risks increase the probability of an adverse impact
on Old Line Bancshares’ financial results as fewer borrowers would be eligible to borrow and property values could be below necessary levels
required for adequate coverage on the requested loan.

 
Old Line Bancshares depends on the services of key personnel. The loss of any of these personnel could disrupt its operations and its

business could suffer. Old Line Bancshares’ success depends substantially on the skills and abilities of its executive management team, including
James W. Cornelsen, its President and Chief Executive Officer, John Miller, its Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Mark A. Semanie,
its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Elise M. Hubbard, its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Although Old
Line Bank has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Cornelsen, Miller and Semanie, the existence of such agreements does not assure
that Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank will retain their services. Further, neither Old Line Bancshares nor Old Line Bank has entered into an
employment agreement with Ms. Hubbard, and therefore she can terminate her employment at any time and for any reason. These executives provide
valuable services to Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank and would be difficult to replace.

 
Also, Old Line Bancshares’ growth and success and its anticipated future growth and success, in a large part, is due and will continue to be

due to the relationships maintained by its banking executives with its customers. The loss of services of one or more of these executives or of other
key employees could have a material adverse effect on Old Line Bancshares’ operations and its business could suffer. The experienced commercial
lenders that Old Line Bank has hired are not a party to any employment agreement with Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank and they could
terminate their employment at any time and for any reason.

Old Line Bancshares’ growth and expansion strategy may not be successful. Old Line Bancshares’ ability to grow depends upon its ability

to attract new deposits, identify loan and investment opportunities and maintain adequate capital levels. Old Line Bancshares may also grow through
acquisitions of existing financial institutions or branches thereof, as it is doing through the proposed merger with Bay Bancorp. There are no
guarantees that Old Line Bancshares’ expansion strategies will be successful. Also, in order to effectively manage its anticipated and/or actual loan
growth Old Line Bancshares has made and may continue to make additional investments in equipment and personnel, which could increase its non-
interest expense. If Old Line Bancshares grows too quickly and is not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could materially
and adversely affect its financial performance.

 
If Old Line Bancshares’ allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, its earnings will decrease. Old Line

Bancshares maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in its loan portfolio. Old Line
Bancshares’ management, through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses.
Although Old Line Bancshares believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in its loan portfolio, even under
normal economic conditions it cannot predict such losses with certainty. The unprecedented volatility experienced in the financial and capital markets
during the last several years makes this determination even more difficult as processes Old Line Bancshares uses to estimate the allowance for loan
losses may no longer be dependable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions that may not be accurate.
As a result, Old Line Bancshares cannot be sure that its allowance is or will be adequate in the future. If management’s assumptions and judgments
prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, Old Line Bancshares’ earnings will suffer.

 
As of September 30, 2017, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise approximately 77.2% of Old

Line Bancshares’ loan portfolio. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate or consumer
loans and typically have larger balances than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. A deterioration of one or a few of these loans could
cause a significant increase in Old Line Bancshares’ non-performing loans. Such an increase could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans,
an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Old Line
Bancshares’ financial condition and results of operations.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ profitability depends on interest rates and changes in monetary policy may impact it. Old Line Bancshares’ results

of operations depend to a large extent on its “net interest income,” which is the difference between the interest expense incurred in connection with
its interest bearing liabilities, such as interest on deposit accounts, and the interest income received from its interest earning assets, such as loans and
investment securities. Interest rates, because they are influenced by, among other things, expectations about future events, including the level of
economic activity, federal monetary and fiscal policy, and geopolitical stability, are not predictable or controllable. Additionally, competitive factors
heavily influence the interest rates Old Line Bancshares can earn on its loan and investment portfolios and the interest rates Old Line Bank pays on
its deposits. Community banks are often at a competitive disadvantage in managing their cost of funds compared to the large regional, super- regional
or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets. These factors influence Old Line Bancshares’ ability to maintain
a stable net interest margin.

 
Old Line Bancshares seeks to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during any

period so that it may reasonably predict its net interest margin. Interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production and deposit flows,
however, are constantly changing and influence Old Line Bancshares’ ability to maintain this neutral position. Generally speaking, Old Line
Bancshares’ earnings are more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates the greater the variance in the volume of assets and liabilities that mature and
reprice in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of
interest rates, and whether Old Line Bancshares is more asset than liability sensitive. Accordingly, Old Line Bancshares may not be successful in
maintaining this neutral position and, as a result, its net interest margin may suffer.

 
Old Line Bancshares faces substantial competition that could adversely affect its growth and operating results. Old Line Bancshares

operates in a competitive market for financial services and faces intense competition from other financial institutions both in making loans and in
attracting deposits. Many of these financial institutions have been in business for many years, are significantly larger and have established customer
bases and greater financial resources and lending limits than Old Line Bancshares does, and are able to offer certain services that Old Line
Bancshares is not able to offer. There are also a number of smaller community-based banks that pursue operating strategies similar to Old Line
Bancshares’. Competitive pressures will also likely continue to build as the financial services industry continues to consolidate and as additional non-
bank investment and financial services options for consumers become available and consumers become increasingly comfortable using such
alternatives. If Old Line Bancshares cannot attract deposits and make loans at a sufficient level, its operating results will suffer, as will its
opportunities for growth.

Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions. Technology and other changes are allowing consumers to

complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds
that they have historically held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can
also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as
intermediaries, which may increase as consumers become more comfortable with these new technologies and offerings, could result in the loss of fee
income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the
lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on Old Line Bancshares’ financial condition and results of operations.

 
Old Line Bancshares continually encounters technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid

technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by new or modified products and services. The effective use of
technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Old Line Bancshares’ future success
depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer
demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of Old Line Bancshares’ competitors have substantially greater resources
to invest in technological improvements. Old Line Bancshares may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and
services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change
affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on Old Line Bancshares’ business and, in turn, its financial condition
and results of operations.

 
The market value of Old Line Bancshares’ investments could negatively impact stockholders’ equity. Old Line Bancshares has designated

all of its investment securities portfolio (or 10.4% of total assets) at September 30, 2017 as available for sale. Old Line Bancshares “marks to market”
temporary unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available for sale portfolio and reflects this adjustment as a separate item in
stockholders’ equity, net of taxes. As of September 30, 2017, Old Line Bancshares had temporary unrealized losses in its available for sale portfolio
of fair value of $2.2 million (reflected as $1.3 million net of taxes). As a result of the last economic recession and the continued economic slowdown,
several municipalities continue to report budget deficits. These budget deficits could cause temporary and other than temporary impairment charges
in Old Line Bancshares’ investment securities portfolio and cause it to report lower net income and a decline in stockholders’ equity.

 
Old Line Bancshares may issue shares of common stock in the future in connection with acquisitions or otherwise, and any such

issuances could be at varying prices and dilute your ownership of Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares may use its common stock to acquire
other companies or to make investments in banks and other complementary businesses in the future. Old Line Bancshares may also issue common
stock, or securities convertible into common stock, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital in connection with future
acquisitions, to satisfy regulatory capital requirements or for general corporate purposes. It should be noted that Old Line Bancshares has an effective
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC pursuant to which Old Line Bancshares may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate
of $100 million of its common stock, preferred stock, warrants, units and debt securities. The existence of such shelf registration statement allows
Old Line Bancshares to sell securities quickly from time to time as market conditions warrant. The merger agreement does not prohibit Old Line
Bancshares from selling securities, including shares of its common stock, through the shelf registration statement or otherwise or provide for any
adjustment to the merger consideration if Old Line Bancshares were to do so. Further, if Old Line Bancshares were to sell shares of common stock, it
could do so at a price or prices that are less than the price of Old Line Bancshares common stock that will be used to calculate the exchange ratio in
the merger, which would provide the purchasers of those shares with more value than the value of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock
that you will receive in the merger. Finally, any such common stock issuances, or issuance of other securities under which shares of common stock
may be issued, could be dilutive to other stockholders of Old Line Bancshares, including current stockholders of Bay Bancorp who receive shares of
Old Line Bancshares common stock in the merger.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ future acquisitions, if any, may cause it to become more susceptible to adverse economic events. While Old Line

Bancshares currently has no agreements to acquire additional financial institutions, other than Bay Bancorp, it may do so in the future if an attractive
acquisition opportunity arises that is consistent with its business plan. Any future business acquisitions could be material to Old Line Bancshares, and
the degree of success achieved in acquiring and integrating these businesses into Old Line Bancshares could have a material effect on the value of its
common stock. In addition, any acquisition could require Old Line Bancshares to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those
events, Old Line Bancshares could become more susceptible to future economic downturns and competitive pressures.

Old Line Bank faces limits on its ability to lend. The amount of Old Line Bank’s capital limits the amount that it can loan to a single

borrower. Generally, under current law, Old Line Bank may lend up to 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. As of
September 30, 2017, Old Line Bank was able to lend approximately $30.7 million to any one borrower. This amount is significantly less than that of
many of its larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of Old Line Bank’s legal lending limit from
doing business with Old Line Bank. Old Line Bank generally tries to accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other
financial institutions, but this strategy is not always available. Old Line Bank may not be able to attract or maintain customers seeking larger loans
and may not be able to sell participations in such loans on terms it considers favorable.

 
Additional capital may not be available when needed or required by regulatory authorities. Federal and state regulatory authorities require

Old Line Bancshares to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. In addition, Old Line Bancshares may elect to raise additional
capital to support its business or to finance future acquisitions, if any, or it may otherwise elect or its regulators may require that it raise additional
capital. Old Line Bancshares’ ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and
a number of other factors, many of which are outside its control. Conditions in the capital markets may be such that traditional sources of capital may
not be available to Old Line Bancshares on reasonable terms if it needed to raise additional capital. Accordingly, Old Line Bancshares may not be
able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to its existing stockholders. If Old Line Bancshares
cannot raise additional capital when needed, or on desirable terms, this may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

 
Old Line Bancshares may not have adequately assessed the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Current accounting guidance

requires that Old Line Bancshares record assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values on the purchase date. The determination of fair value
requires that Old Line Bancshares consider a number of factors including the remaining life of the acquired loans and deposits, estimated
prepayments or withdrawals, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and the net present value of expected cash flows.
Actual deviations from these predicted cash flows, maturities or repayments or the underlying value of the collateral may mean that Old Line
Bancshares’ present value determination is inaccurate. This may cause fluctuations in interest income, non-interest income, provision expense,
interest expense and non-interest expense and negatively impact Old Line Bancshares’ results of operations.

 
The market price of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock can be volatile. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for an investor

to resell our common stock when desired and at attractive prices. The market price of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock can fluctuate significantly
in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:

 
· actual or anticipated variations in Old Line Bancshares’ operating results;

 
· changes in expectations as to Old Line Bancshares’ future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations

by securities analysts or others in the industry;
 

· changes in the regulatory or legal environment in which Old Line Bancshares operates;
 

· news reports or other publicity relating to Old Line Bancshares or our competitors or relating to trends in its industry;
 

· perceptions in the marketplace regarding Old Line Bancshares and/or its competitors;
 

· future sales of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock;
 

· the announcement of a significant acquisition or business combination, strategic partnership, joint venture or capital commitment
by or involving Old Line Bancshares or its competitors; and

 
· geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.

General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events in the U.S. or globally, such as

economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause Old Line Bancshares’ stock price to decrease
regardless of operating results.

 
Shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock are equity interests and therefore subordinate to its existing and future indebtedness and

preferred stock we may issue in the future. Shares of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock are equity interests in Old Line Bancshares and do not
constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on it
with respect to assets available to satisfy claims, including upon its liquidation. Holders of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock are also subject to
the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of its preferred stock that it may issue in the future.

 
In addition, Old Line Bancshares’ right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries, including Old Line Bank, upon

the subsidiary’s liquidation or otherwise, and thus your ability as a holder of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock to benefit indirectly from such
distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of Old Line Bancshares’ claims as a
creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, shares of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock are effectively subordinated to all existing
and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by law, and it may be unable to pay future dividends. Old Line

Bancshares are a separate and distinct legal entity from Old Line Bank, and it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from Old Line
Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Old Line Bancshares’ common stock and interest and principal on debt.
Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Old Line Bank may pay to Old Line Bancshares. In the event Old
Line Bank is unable to pay dividends to Old Line Bancshares, Old Line Bancshares may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends
on its common stock. The inability to receive dividends from Old Line Bank could have a material adverse effect on Old Line Bancshares’ business,
financial condition and results of operations.

 
Old Line Bancshares may need to raise additional capital in the future. If Old Line Bancshares is are unable to obtain such capital on

favorable terms or at all, it may not be able to execute on its business plans and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be
adversely affected. Old Line Bancshares may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund its growth and acquisition activities. Any sale of
additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders. Public or private financing may not be available in
amounts or on terms acceptable to Old Line Bancshares, if at all. If Old Line Bancshares is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate its growth and acquisition activities, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and
operating results.

 
Anti-takeover provisions could adversely affect our stockholders. Maryland law and provisions contained in Old Line Bancshares’ articles

of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for a third party to acquire it, even if doing so might be beneficial to Old Line Bancshares’
stockholders. For example, Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to determine the designation, preferences,
limitations and relative rights of unissued preferred stock, without any vote or action by Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders. As a result, Old Line
Bancshares’ board of directors could authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the
voting or other rights of holders of its common stock or with other terms that could impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover
attempt. In addition, certain provisions of Maryland law, including a provision that restricts certain business combinations between a Maryland
corporation and certain interested stockholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of Old Line
Bancshares that some or all of its stockholders might consider to be desirable. As a result, efforts by Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders to change its
direction or management may be unsuccessful.

 
The ability of a third party to acquire Old Line Bancshares is also limited under applicable banking regulations. With certain limited

exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person, a company or a group of persons deemed to be “acting in concert” from, directly or indirectly,
acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of Old Line Bancshares’ voting stock or obtaining the ability to
control in any manner the election of a majority of its directors or otherwise direct its management or policies without prior notice or application to
and the approval of the FRB. Companies investing in banks and bank holding companies receive additional review and may be required to become
bank holding companies, subject to regulatory supervision. Accordingly, prospective investors must be aware of and comply with these requirements,
if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock. These provisions effectively inhibit certain mergers
or other business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock.

Additional Risk Factors Associated with Bay Bancorp
 
Bay Bancorp’s loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial and real estate and in certain geographic areas. Bay Bancorp’s commercial

loans, including commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, totaled $312 million as of September 30, 2017, or 59% of its loan
portfolio, while its residential real estate loans totaled $145 million, or 28% of its loan portfolio. Additionally, its construction loans totaled $29
million as of September 30, 2017, or 6% of its loan portfolio. Approximately 98% of Bay Bancorp’s loans were originated in Maryland. Commercial
lending generally carries a higher degree of credit risk than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors including larger loan balances,
dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment, or loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization
over the loan term. Further, any weakness in the real estate market could adversely affect Bay Bank’s customers, which in turn could adversely
impact its loan portfolio.

 
An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an

increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Bay Bancorp, and,
upon consummation of the merger, of Old Line Bancshares.

 
Risk Factors as they Relate to Bay Bancorp’s Stockholders in Connection with the Merger
 
Bay Bancorp’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the

interests of Bay Bancorp stockholders. In considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that
the directors and certain executive officers of Bay Bancorp have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests
of Bay Bancorp stockholders. The directors of Bay Bancorp who collectively hold or have the right to vote or direct the vote of approximately 33.8%
of the outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock have agreed to vote in favor of the merger proposal. These voting agreements may have the
effect of discouraging persons from making a proposal to acquire Bay Bancorp. Further, certain executive officers of Bay Bancorp may be entitled to
change-in-control or other severance payments in connection with the merger under existing arrangements. Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank
have agreed to elect Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric D. Hovde, who serves as Chairman of the boards
of directors of both Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, and Steven K. Breeden, a current director of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, to the boards of directors
of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, who will be compensated for their service on the board of directors of Old Line Bank. Finally, Steven D.
Hovde, a director of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, is also the President and Chief Executive Officer of Hovde Group, which served as a financial
advisor to Bay Bancorp and will receive investment banking fees in connection with the merger. These and certain other additional interests of Bay
Bancorp’s directors and executive officers are described in detail in “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Interests of Directors and Officers in
the Merger.” These circumstances may cause some of Bay Bancorp directors and executive officers to view the proposed transaction differently than
you view it.

 
Because the merger consideration is subject to adjustment, Bay Bancorp stockholders will not know until the effective time of the merger

the value of the consideration they will receive in the merger. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Bay Bancorp common stock will be
converted into the right to receive merger consideration consisting of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement. As discussed above, the exchange ratio will be fixed if the Average Price is above $29.15 or below $25.66. If the exchange ratio is
fixed, the value of the merger consideration will be dependent upon the value of Old Line Bancshares common stock and, therefore, will fluctuate
with the market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock. Accordingly, if the exchange ratio is fixed, any change in the price of Old Line
Bancshares common stock prior to the merger will affect the market value of the merger consideration that stockholders of Bay Bancorp will receive
as a result of the merger. Further, the exchange ratio, and as a result the value of the merger consideration to be received by Bay Bancorp
stockholders, will be adjusted as provided in the merger agreement for the after-tax income recognized by Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank from the recent
settlement of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans. Assuming Bay Bank recognizes after-tax income of $984,750 in connection with
the resolution of the litigation and $605,613 from the resolution of loans, the exchange ratio, based on the closing price of Old Line Bancshares
common stock for the 20 trading days ending five trading days before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, would be 0.4095. Final
calculations regarding the exchange ratio, however, will not be completed until the closing of the merger or shortly before closing.

 

 28  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 36/225

 

 
Further, the exchange ratio will not be adjusted if the Average Price falls below $25.65, although as discussed below Bay Bancorp can

terminate the merger agreement in certain circumstances based if the volume-weighted average closing price of Old Line Bancshares common stock
during any 20 trading day period during the five-day period commencing with the fifth trading day immediately preceding the effective date of the
merger falls below the thresholds set forth in the merger agreement and Old Line Bancshares does not increase the merger consideration. As a result,
the value of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that a Bay Bancorp stockholder receives in the merger will decline correspondingly with
declines in the Average Price below $25.65 prior to and as of the date the merger consideration is received.

 
Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting of Bay Bancorp stockholders, Bay Bancorp stockholders will not know or be able to

calculate the amount or the value of the number of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that they would receive upon completion of the
merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the businesses,
operations and prospects of Old Line Bancshares and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond Old Line Bancshares’ control. You
should obtain current market quotations for shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock.

 
Bay Bancorp has the option, but is not required, to terminate the merger agreement if the volume-weighted average closing price of Old

Line Bancshares common stock during any 20 trading day period during the five-day period commencing with the fifth trading day immediately
preceding the effective date of the merger falls below the thresholds set forth in the merger agreement, although Bay Bancorp does not have this
option if Old Line Bancshares, in its sole discretion, increases the per share consideration as set forth in the merger agreement. Bay Bancorp cannot
predict at this time whether or not its board of directors would exercise its right to terminate the merger agreement if these conditions were met. The
merger agreement does not provide for a resolicitation of Bay Bancorp stockholders in the event that the conditions are met and the Bay Bancorp
board nevertheless chooses to complete the transaction. In considering whether to exercise its right to terminate the merger agreement, Bay Bancorp’
board of directors would take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances that exist at the time and would consult with its financial advisor
and legal counsel.

 
The provisions of the merger agreement limiting Bay Bancorp’s ability to pursue alternative transactions to the merger and requiring

Bay Bancorp to pay a termination fee if it does may discourage others from trying to acquire Bay Bancorp. The merger agreement prohibits Bay
Bancorp and its directors, officers, employees, advisors and other representatives, subject to narrow exceptions, from initiating, encouraging,
soliciting or entering into discussions with any third party regarding alternative acquisition proposals. This prohibition limits Bay Bancorp’s ability to
pursue offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior from a financial point of view. If Bay Bancorp receives an unsolicited proposal from
a third party that is superior from a financial point of view to that made by Old Line Bancshares and the merger agreement is terminated, Bay
Bancorp would be required to pay a termination fee to Old Line Bancshares. This fee makes it less likely that a third party will make an alternative
acquisition proposal.

 
If the merger fails to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, Bay Bancorp

stockholders may be required to recognize additional gain or recognize loss on the exchange of their shares of Bay Bancorp common stock in the
merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, and it is a condition to the respective obligations of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares to complete the merger that each
of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares receives a legal opinion to that effect. Neither of these opinions will be binding on the Internal Revenue
Service. Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any
matters relating to the merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a contrary position. If the merger fails to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
Bay Bancorp stockholders may be required to recognize gain or loss on the exchange of their shares of Bay Bancorp common stock in the merger for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, Bay Bancorp will be treated as having sold all of its assets to Old Line Bancshares in a taxable
transaction, and will recognize taxable gain to the extent the sum of the total consideration paid by Old Line Bancshares to the Bay Bancorp
stockholders, plus the liabilities of Bay Bancorp, exceeds the tax basis of Bay Bancorp in its assets, including its tax basis in its bank and other
subsidiaries. Old Line Bancshares would succeed to and become liable for any such Bay Bancorp corporate tax as a consequence of the merger. For
further information, see “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences.”

 
After the merger is completed, Bay Bancorp stockholders will become Old Line Bancshares stockholders and will have different rights

that may be less advantageous than their current rights. Upon completion of the merger, Bay Bancorp stockholders will receive Old Line
Bancshares common stock for their shares of Bay Bancorp common stock and become Old Line Bancshares stockholders. Differences in Bay
Bancorp’s articles of incorporation and bylaws and Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation and bylaws will result in changes to the rights of
Bay Bancorp stockholders when they become Old Line Bancshares stockholders. For more information, see “Comparison of Stockholder Rights.” A
stockholder of Bay Bancorp may conclude that his, her or its current rights under Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation and bylaws are more
advantageous than the rights they may have as an Old Line Bancshares stockholder under Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation and bylaws.

Bay Bancorp’s stockholders will have less influence as stockholders of Old Line Bancshares than as stockholders of Bay Bancorp. Bay

Bancorp stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors of Bay Bancorp and on other matters affecting Bay
Bancorp. The stockholders of Bay Bancorp as a group will own between approximately 25.70% and 28.22% of the combined organization (Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp), assuming Old Line Bancshares does not exercise its option to increase the merger consideration to avoid termination
of the merger agreement based on recent trading prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock prior to the merger. When the merger occurs, each
former Bay Bancorp stockholder will become a stockholder of Old Line Bancshares with a percentage ownership of the combined organization much
smaller than such stockholder’s percentage ownership of Bay Bancorp. Because of this, stockholders of Bay Bancorp will have less influence on the
management and policies of Old Line Bancshares than they now have on the management and policies of Bay Bancorp.

 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

 
Old Line Bancshares’ 2017 Unaudited Financial Results
 

On January 23, 2018, Old Line Bancshares reported its financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017. Old Line
Bancshares reported net income available to common stockholders of $16.0 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.8
million, or 21.35%, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $13.2 million for the same period of 2016. Earnings were $1.38
per basic and $1.35 per diluted common share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.21 per basic and $1.20 per diluted
common share for the same period of 2016. The increase in net income is primarily the result of an increase of $9.2 million, or 17.33%, in net interest
income, partially offset by increases of $5.2 million in non-interest expenses and $1.3 million in income tax expense and a $455 thousand decrease in
non-interest income.

 
Net income available to common stockholders was $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.3 million

for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.5 million, or 35.26%. Earnings were $0.47 per basic and $0.46 per diluted
common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.40 per basic share and $0.39 per diluted common share for the three
months ended December 31, 2016.

 
Two income tax matters had a significant influence on the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017. First, on December 22, 2017

the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the President of the United States of America. Upon enactment of this legislation, which lowers the
corporate income tax marginal rates beginning in 2018, companies were required by accounting standards to revalue their deferred tax assets and
liabilities as of December 31, 2017 at the lower enacted rate. Through an analysis of the deferred tax accounts, the estimated impact of the change in
rate resulted in an adjustment of $1.89 million to the net deferred income taxes and a resulting increase in income tax expense. Secondly, in the prior
year, Old Line Bancshares had maintained a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in relation to net operating loss carryovers and other items in
relation to the acquisition of Regal Bank December 2015. The concerns that existed at the time of establishing the valuation reserve relating to this
acquisition no longer exist and Old Line Bancshares has reversed this valuation allowance in total. The effect of reversing this valuation reserve
increased net deferred income taxes in the amount of $2.36 million with a resulting decrease in income tax expense. The net impact of these two
matters resulted in a reduction of income tax expense by $472 thousand and an increase in both basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 for the
fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.

 
Net interest income increased $3.2 million, or 22.94%, and $9.2 million, or 17.33%, for the three- and 12-month periods ended December

31, 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, primarily due to increases in the interest recognized on loans as a result of the DCB acquisition and,
to a lesser extent, organic loan growth, partially offset by increases in interest expense. Interest expense increased to $3.2 million and $11.5 million,
respectively, for the three- and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.3 million and $7.5 million for the same periods of 2016.
Interest expense increased during both periods due to increases in both the amount of and interest rate paid on our deposits and, for the 12-month
period, interest paid on the subordinated notes issued in 2016 for a full year compared to a four-month period during 2016.

The provision for loan losses decreased $100 thousand for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period

2016 due to an improvement in non-performing assets. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, the provision decreased $629 thousand,
primarily due to one large commercial borrower, consisting of 23 commercial loans totaling $3.0 million, of which $1.0 million was charged-off
against the allowance for loan losses and $2.0 million was reclassified as trouble debt restructurings during the first quarter of 2017. Amounts
charged off in relation to these loans during 2017 were in line with specific reserves at December 31, 2016.

 
Non-interest income increased $228 thousand, or 14.52%, for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same

period of 2016, primarily as a result of increases of $188 thousand in other fees and commissions and $156 thousand in service charges on deposit
accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $91 thousand in income on marketable loans. The increase in other fees and commissions is primarily the
result of recoveries of previously charged-off acquired loans and an increase in rental income. The increase in service charges on deposits accounts is
the result of increased income on bank debit cards due to the increased deposit base primarily as a result of the DCB merger. The decrease in income
on marketable loans is a result of a decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market compared to the same period of
2016.

 
Non-interest income decreased $455 thousand, or 5.52%, for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period

of 2016. The decrease is primarily the result of a $1.2 million decrease in gain on sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases of $250
thousand in other fees and commissions, $101 thousand in gain on disposal of assets, $254 thousand on service charges on deposit accounts and $95
thousand in gain on sales of loans compared to the same period of 2016. The decrease in gain on sales or calls or investment securities is the result of
Old Line Bancshares re-positioning its investment portfolio during 2016, pursuant to which it sold approximately $108 million of its lowest yielding,
longer duration investments; during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Old Line Bancshares had $60.9 million in sales and calls of
investment securities, $41.8 million of which was from, and sold immediately after, the DCB merger, resulting in no gain or loss. The increase in
gain on disposal of assets is due to the sale of two previously-owned locations, the Accokeek branch that was closed in 2016 and Callaway branch
that was closed in 2017. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts is the result of increased income on bank debit cards primarily due to the
increase in our customer deposit base as noted above. The increase in gain on sale of loans (other than residential mortgage loans held for sale) is due
to the sale of one SBA loan during the 2017 period, whereas there we no sales of portfolio loans during the 2016 period.

 
Non-interest expense increased $2.1 million, or 23.91%, for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period

of 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in salaries and benefits expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses and other operating expenses.
Salaries and benefits increased $948 thousand primarily as a result of the additional staff, and occupancy and equipment expenses increased $427
thousand, primarily as a result of the new branches acquired in the DCB merger.

 
Non-interest expense increased $5.2 million, or 13.12%, for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of

2016, primarily as a result of increases in merger and integration expenses and, to a lesser extent, in salaries and benefits and occupancy and
equipment expenses, partially offset by a lack of severance payments in 2017 compared to $443 thousand of such payments in 2016. Merger and
integration expenses increased $3.3 million to $4.0 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 due to the DCB acquisition, compared to
$661 thousand of merger and integration expenses during 2016 in connection with the Regal Bancorp, Inc. acquisition that was consummated in
December 2015. Consistent with the increases in non-interest expenses during the three-month period, the $963 thousand increase in salaries and
benefits expenses is primarily the result of the additional staff, and the $285 thousand occupancy and equipment expense is primarily associated with
the new branches, acquired in the DCB acquisition.

 
Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.84% and 8.53%, respectively, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017,

compared to 0.83% and 8.83%, respectively, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.
 
Total assets were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016. Net loans held for investment

increased to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. Total deposits increased to $1.7 billion at December
31, 2017 compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was $207.7 million compared to $150.7 million
at December 31, 2016.

 
Non-performing assets were 0.18% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.59% of total assets at December 31, 2016.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA OF OLD LINE BANCSHARES

 
The following table summarizes Old Line Bancshares’ selected financial information and other financial data as of and for the periods

indicated. The selected balance sheet and statement of income data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are

adjustments that are, in the opinion of Old Line Bancshares’ management, necessary for a fair presentation of the result for the interim periods
presented. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved by Old
Line Bancshares for all of fiscal 2017 or for any other period.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared using the acquisition method of

accounting, giving effect to the merger. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition combines
the historical information of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp as of September 30, 2017 and assumes that the merger was completed on that
date. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income combines the historical financial information of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp and give effect to the merger as if it had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. The Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for Old Line Bancshares also combines the historical financial information of
Old Line Bancshares and DCB, which was acquired by Old Line Bancshares effective July 28, 2017 and gives effect to that merger as if it had been
completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of income or financial condition had the merger been
completed on the date described above, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of income in future periods or the future financial condition and
results of income of the combined entities. The financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. Certain reclassifications have been made to Bay Bancorp’s historical financial
information in order to conform to Old Line Bancshares’ presentation of financial information.

 
The proposed merger is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2018. There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed as

anticipated. For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information, the fair value of Old Line
Bancshares’ common stock to be issued in connection with the merger was based on Old Line Bancshares’ closing stock price of $28.00 on
September 29, 2017.

 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information includes estimated adjustments, including adjustments

to record Bay Bancorp’s assets and liabilities at their respective fair values, and represents Old Line Bancshares’ pro forma estimates based on
available fair value information as of the date of the merger agreement. In some cases, where noted, more recent information has been used to
support estimated adjustments in the pro forma financial information.

 
The pro forma adjustments are subject to change depending on changes in interest rates and the components of assets and liabilities and as

additional information becomes available and additional analyses are performed. The final allocation of the purchase price for the merger will be
determined after it is completed and after completion of thorough analyses to determine the fair value of Bay Bancorp’s tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and liabilities as of the date the merger is completed. Increases or decreases in the estimated fair values of the net assets as
compared with the information shown in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information may change the
amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill and other assets and liabilities and may impact Old Line Bancshares’ statement of income due to
adjustments in yield and/or amortization of the adjusted assets or liabilities. Any changes to Bay Bancorp’s stockholders’ equity, including results of
operations from September 30, 2017 through the date the merger is completed, will also change the purchase price allocation, which may include the
recording of a lower or higher amount of goodwill. The final adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma adjustments
presented herein.

 
We anticipate that the merger will provide the combined company with financial benefits that include reduced operating expenses. The

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the
combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings or opportunities to earn additional revenue
and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined
company would have been had Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp been combined during these periods.

 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information has been derived from and should be read in

conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, each of which is
incorporated herein by reference.

trading days before the applicable date ($27.34 for September 27, 2017 and $30.2883 for February 1, 2018), in each case taking into account
assumed adjustments to the exchange ratio based on current information, multiplied by the closing sales price of Old Line Bancshares common stock
on such date. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement and The Merger – Terms of the Merger – What Bay Bancorp
Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger.”

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Old Line Bancshares and Bay

Bancorp. The unaudited pro forma data, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of
assumptions, does not reflect the impact of factors that may result as a consequence of the merger or consider any potential impacts of current market
conditions or the merger on revenues, expense efficiencies or asset dispositions, among other factors, nor the impact of possible business model
changes. As a result, unaudited pro forma data are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not represent an attempt to predict or suggest future
results. Upon completion of the merger, the operating results of Bay Bancorp will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Old Line
Bancshares on a prospective basis.

THE OLD LINE BANCSHARES SPECIAL MEETING

 
Date, Time and Place
 

Old Line Bancshares will hold a special meeting of its stockholders at its office located at 1525 Pointer Ridge Place, Bowie, Maryland,
20716, at 9:00 a.m. on March 28, 2018.

 
Purpose of the Special Meeting
 

At the special meeting, Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon proposals to:
 
1.       Approve the merger of Bay Bancorp with and into Old Line Bancshares, with Old Line Bancshares as the surviving entity, pursuant to

the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 27, 2017, by and between Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, as the agreement may
be amended from time to time;

 
2.       Adjourn the special meeting if more time is needed to solicit additional proxies; and
 
3.       Transact any other business that may properly be brought before the special meeting.
 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Old Line Bancshares
 

The Old Line Bancshares board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger, has unanimously declared
them to be advisable and in the best interests of Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders, and unanimously recommends that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders
vote “FOR” the approval of the merger in Proposal 1.

 
The Old Line Bancshares board of directors also unanimously recommends that Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders vote “FOR” the

approval of the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies in Proposal 2.
 

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote
 

Stockholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2018, which the Old Line Bancshares board of directors has set as the record
date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on that date, there were 12,543,653 shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, outstanding and entitled to vote, each of which is entitled to one vote.

 
Quorum
 

The presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting (or
6,271,827) shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock) will be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special
meeting. Abstentions are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the special
meeting.

 
Under Maryland law, broker non-votes are also counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction

of business at special meetings. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, brokerage firm or other similar holder of record (referred to as “in
street name”), you will receive instructions from the holder of record that you must follow for you to specify how your shares will be voted. In
general, under the rules of the various national and regional securities exchanges, holders of record have the authority to vote shares for which their
customers do not provide voting instructions on certain routine, uncontested items, but not on non-routine proposals. In the case of non-routine items
for which specific voting instructions have not been provided, the institution holding street name shares cannot vote those shares. These are
considered to be “broker non-votes.” Since there are no routine items to be voted on at the special meeting, nominee record holders of Old Line
Bancshares common stock that do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owners of such shares will not be able to return a proxy card
with respect to such shares; as a result, these shares will not be considered present at the special meeting and will not count towards the satisfaction
of a quorum.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 48/225

 

 
Vote Required
 

Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation provide that the approval of certain transactions, including a merger, requires the vote of a
majority of the shares of each class of Old Line Bancshares’ capital stock entitled to vote thereon, if the merger has been approved by a majority of
its board of directors. As a result, the proposal at the Old Line Bancshares special meeting to approve the merger requires the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of common stock cast on the matter is required to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if
necessary.

 
Directors and executive officers of Old Line Bancshares and their affiliates, who beneficially own approximately 8.09% of Old Line

Bancshares common stock outstanding as of the record date, are expected to vote for approval of the merger.
 

Abstentions and Failure to Vote
 

Because approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Old Line
Bancshares common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, abstentions, the failure to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as
votes against this matter. In other words, if you are an Old Line Bancshares stockholder and fail to vote, fail to instruct your broker or nominee to
vote, or vote to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the proposal to approve the merger. Accordingly, the Old Line Bancshares board of
directors urges you to submit your proxy to vote as instructed below.

 
As noted above, approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary, requires the affirmative

vote of at least a majority of all votes cast on the matter at the special meeting. Abstentions, the failure to vote and broker non-votes are not included
in calculating votes cast with respect to this proposal and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal (assuming a quorum is
present).

 
Voting of Proxies
 

The enclosed proxy with respect to the Old Line Bancshares special meeting is solicited by the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares.
The board of directors has selected Gregory S. Proctor, Jr. and Gail D. Manuel, or either of them, to act as proxies with full power of substitution.

 
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, you may submit a proxy to vote your shares via Internet, telephone or mail as

outlined below. You will need information from your proxy card or electronic delivery notice to submit your proxy to vote your shares by Internet or
telephone.

 
· By Internet: Go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions.
 
· By Telephone: Call 1-800-690-6903 and follow the voice mail prompts.
 
· By Mail: Mark your vote, sign your name exactly as it appears on your proxy card, date your proxy card and return it in the

envelope provided.
 

All proxies will be voted as directed by the stockholder on the proxy form. A proxy, if executed and not revoked, will be voted in the
following manner (unless it contains instructions to the contrary, in which event it will be voted in accordance with such instructions):

 
· FOR approval of the merger; and

 
· FOR approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary.

 
At the date hereof, management has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for consideration at the special meeting and that

would be required to be set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or in the related Old Line Bancshares proxy card, other than the matters set
forth in the Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders of Old Line Bancshares. In accordance with Maryland law, business transacted at the Old Line
Bancshares special meeting will be limited to those matters set forth in the notice. Nonetheless, if any other matter is properly presented at the Old
Line Bancshares special meeting for consideration, proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holder on such matter. If the special meeting is
postponed or adjourned, your Old Line Bancshares common stock may be voted by the persons named in the proxy card on the new special meeting
date, provided that the new meeting occurs within 120 days of the record date for the special meeting, unless you have revoked your proxy.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign and return the enclosed proxy card, or indicate your vote by phone or Internet as

described above, as soon as possible whether or not you intend to attend the Old Line Bancshares special meeting.
 

Shares Held in Street Name
 

If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank or other nominee (that is, in street name), you must
provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares if you wish them to be counted, unless your shares are held of
record by a bank or other nominee and you have an arrangement with the nominee granting such nominee discretionary authority to vote your shares.
Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you are an Old Line Bancshares stockholder and you do not
instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may not vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Old Line Bancshares or by voting in

person at the meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee.
 
Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign and return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s instructions.
 

Revocability of Proxies
 

You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by
properly executed proxies will be voted at the special meeting and all adjournments thereof. To revoke your proxy, you must send written notice to
the Secretary, Old Line Bancshares, Inc., 1525 Pointer Ridge Place, Bowie, Maryland 20716, file a later-dated proxy before your common stock has
been voted at the special meeting or attend the special meeting and vote in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in itself constitute
revocation of your proxy.

 
Solicitation of Proxies
 

Your proxy is being solicited by the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares will pay the costs of soliciting proxies.
These costs may include reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. Old Line Bancshares will reimburse
banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners of the
common stock of Old Line Bancshares and obtaining their proxies.

 
In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of Old Line Bancshares may solicit proxies personally, by telephone,

facsimile or electronic mail. Old Line Bancshares will not specifically compensate these persons for soliciting such proxies, but may reimburse them
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, if any.

THE BAY BANCORP SPECIAL MEETING

 
Date, Time and Place
 

Bay Bancorp will hold a special meeting of its stockholders at its office located at 7151 Columbia Gateway Drive, Suite A, Columbia,
Maryland 21046, at 9:00 a.m. on March 28, 2018.

 
Purpose of the Special Meeting
 

At the special meeting, Bay Bancorp’s stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:
 
1.       To approve the merger of Bay Bancorp with and into Old Line Bancshares, with Old Line Bancshares as the surviving entity, pursuant

to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 27, 2017, by and between Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, as the agreement may
be amended from time to time;

 
2.       To adopt the following nonbinding advisory resolution approving “golden parachute compensation” payable to the President and

Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer of Bay Bancorp:
 

RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Bay Bancorp, Inc. approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the agreements for
and compensation to be paid to Bay Bancorp, Inc.’s President and Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President -
Chief Financial Officer, in connection with the merger with Old Line Bancshares, Inc., as disclosed in the section of the
joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger captioned “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Interests of
Directors, Officers and Others in the Merger – Golden Parachute Compensation for Bay Bancorp Named Executive
Officers”;
 

3.       To approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit the solicitation of additional proxies
in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to approve the merger; and

 
4.       To transact such other business that may properly come before the special meeting.
 
Approval of the “golden parachute” proposal (Proposal 2) is not a condition to completion of the merger, and the vote with respect to that

proposal is advisory only and will not be binding on Bay Bancorp or Old Line Bancshares, or their respective board of directors or compensation
committee. Therefore, if the merger is approved by the stockholders of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp and completed, the “golden parachute
compensation” will be paid to Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, subject
to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote. Please see “The Merger Agreement and the Merger – Interests of
Directors, Officers and Others in the Merger – Golden Parachute Compensation for Bay Bancorp Named Executive Officers” for a description of the
“golden parachute” payments that are the subject of the advisory vote.

 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Bay Bancorp
 

The Bay Bancorp board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the merger, has declared them to be advisable and in the best
interests of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, and recommends that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger in Proposal 1.

 
The Bay Bancorp board of directors has also approved and declared advisable the “golden parachute compensation” that may be paid to

Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President - Chief
Financial Officer, in connection with the merger as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and recommends that stockholders of Bay
Bancorp vote “FOR” the adoption of the nonbinding advisory resolution approving such compensation in Proposal 2.

 
The Bay Bancorp board of directors also recommends that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the adjournment of the

special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies in Proposal 3.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 51/225

 

 
Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Number of Votes
 

The Bay Bancorp board of directors has fixed the close of business on January 31, 2018 as the record date for determining those
stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, 10,717,889 shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, were outstanding and entitled to vote, each of which is entitled to one vote.

 
Quorum
 

Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the “MGCL”, and Bay Bancorp’s bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, of
stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting (or 5,358,945 shares of Bay Bancorp common stock) will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
is present.

 
Under Maryland law, broker non-votes are also counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction

of business at special meetings. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, brokerage firm or other similar holder of record (referred to as “in
street name”), you will receive instructions from the holder of record that you must follow for you to specify how your shares will be voted. In
general, under the rules of the various national and regional securities exchanges, holders of record have the authority to vote shares for which their
customers do not provide voting instructions on certain routine, uncontested items, but not on non-routine proposals. In the case of non-routine items
for which specific voting instructions have not been provided, the institution holding street name shares cannot vote those shares. These are
considered to be “broker non-votes.” Since there are no routine items to be voted on at the special meeting, nominee record holders of Bay Bancorp
common stock that do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owners of such shares will not be able to return a proxy card with respect to
such shares; as a result, these shares will not be considered present at the special meeting and will not count towards the satisfaction of a quorum.

 
Vote Required
 

The approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common
stock entitled to vote on the proposal at the special meeting.

 
The proposal to adopt the nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute compensation” and the proposal to adjourn the

special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary, require, in each case, the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common
stock cast on the proposal at the special meeting.

 
Directors and the largest stockholder of Bay Bancorp, who beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 33.8% of Bay Bancorp common

stock as of the record date, have agreed in writing to vote for the approval of the merger.
 

Abstentions and Failure to Vote
 

Because approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, an abstention, a failure to vote and a broker non-vote will all have the same effect as a vote
against this matter. Accordingly, Bay Bancorp’s board of directors urges you to vote your shares in the manner recommended above by completing
and submitting your card or by telephone or through the Internet as instructed in the proxy card.

 
As noted above, (i) the adoption of the nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute compensation” that may be paid to

Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President - Chief
Financial Officer, in connection with the merger and (ii) the adjournment of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary, each
requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all votes cast on the matter at the special meeting. Abstentions, the failure to vote and broker
non-votes are not included in calculating votes cast with respect to these proposals and, therefore, will have no effect on their outcome.

Voting of Proxies
 

The enclosed proxy with respect to the Bay Bancorp special meeting is solicited by the board of directors of Bay Bancorp. The board of
directors has selected Robert J. Aumiller, Mark M. Caplan and Harold I. Hackerman, or any of them, to act as proxies with full power of substitution.

 
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, you may submit a proxy to vote your shares. To do so, mark your vote on the

enclosed proxy card, sign your name exactly as it appears on your proxy card, date your proxy card and return it in the envelope provided. You may
also vote by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 and following the voice mail prompts or through the Internet by following the instructions at
www.proxyvote.com.

 
The shares of Bay Bancorp common stock represented by all properly executed proxy cards received pursuant to this solicitation will be

voted in accordance with the voting instructions given in those proxy cards. Properly executed, unrevoked proxy cards received by Bay Bancorp on
which no voting instructions have been given by a stockholder will be voted FOR the approval of the merger (Proposal 1), FOR the adoption of the
nonbinding advisory resolution approving the “golden parachute compensation” that may be paid to Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s President and
Chief Executive Officer, and Larry D. Pickett, Bay Bancorp’s Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, by Old Line Bancshares in
connection with the merger (Proposal 2), and FOR the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if
necessary (Proposal 3).

 
At the date hereof, management has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for consideration at the special meeting and that

would be required to be set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or in the related Bay Bancorp proxy card, other than the matters set forth in
the Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders of Bay Bancorp. In accordance with Maryland law, business transacted at the Bay Bancorp special
meeting will be limited to those matters set forth in the notice. If, however, any matters not described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are
properly presented at the special meeting, the persons named in the proxy card will vote your shares in their discretion. If the special meeting is
postponed or adjourned, your Bay Bancorp common stock may be voted by the persons named in the proxy card on the new special meeting date,
provided that the new meeting occurs within 120 days of the record date for the special meeting, unless you have revoked your proxy.

 
Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign and return the enclosed proxy card as soon as possible whether or not you intend to

attend the Bay Bancorp special meeting.
 

Shares Held in Street Name
 

If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank or other nominee (that is, in street name), you must
provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares if you wish them to be counted, unless your shares are held of
record by a bank or other nominee and you have an arrangement with the nominee granting such nominee discretionary authority to vote your shares.
Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you are a Bay Bancorp stockholder and you do not instruct
your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may not vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Please note that if you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares of Bay Bancorp common stock are held by a bank or

other nominee, you may not vote those shares by returning a proxy card directly to Bay Bancorp or by voting in person at the special unless you
provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign and return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s instructions.
 

Revocability of Proxies
 

You may revoke your proxy at any time prior to its exercise. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by properly executed proxies will be
voted at the special meeting and all adjournments thereof. You may revoke your proxy at any time prior to its exercise by (i) giving written notice of
revocation to Bay Bancorp, (ii) executing and delivering a proxy card to Bay Bancorp bearing a later date, or (iii) attending the special meeting and
voting in person. The presence of a stockholder at the special meeting will not automatically revoke such stockholder’s proxy.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER

 
The following information describes the material terms and provisions of the merger agreement and the merger. This discussion is subject

and qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A
and incorporated herein by reference.

 
The merger agreement and the summary of its terms in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been included only to provide you with

information about the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger
agreement were made solely for the purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, and were qualified and subject to certain limitations and
exceptions agreed to by Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in
your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described herein, it is important to bear in mind that the
representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and were negotiated for the purpose of
allocating contractual risk among the parties to the merger agreement rather than to establish matters as facts. The representations and warranties may
also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality or material adverse effect different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports
and documents filed with the SEC, and, in some cases, they may be qualified by disclosures made by one party to the other, which are not necessarily
reflected in the merger agreement or other public disclosures made by Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp. The representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time of the merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations, warranties and covenants, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, may have
changed since the date of the merger agreement, and subsequent developments or new information may not be fully reflected in public disclosures of
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp.

 
For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone or

relied upon as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp or any of their respective subsidiaries
or affiliates. Instead, such provisions or descriptions should be read only in conjunction with the other information provided elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference” and “Where You Can Find More Information.” Each of Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will provide additional disclosures in its public reports to the extent they become aware of the existence of any material
facts that are required to be disclosed under federal securities laws and that might otherwise contradict the terms and information contained in the
merger agreement and will update such disclosure as required by federal securities laws.

 
General
 

The merger agreement provides that:
 
· Bay Bancorp will merge with and into Old Line Bancshares, with Old Line Bancshares as the surviving corporation;

 
· If you are a stockholder of Bay Bancorp, you will receive, for each share of Bay Bancorp common stock that you own, that number of

shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock determined by dividing $11.80 by the Average Price, provided that (i) if the Average Price
is $29.16 or more the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.4047 and if the Average Price is $25.65 or less the exchange ratio will be fixed at
0.4600, (ii) the exchange ratio will be adjusted for the after-tax proceeds recognized by Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank in the recent settlement
of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans, and (iii) cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Old Line Bancshares
common stock;

 
· Immediately after the merger, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 27, 2017, by and between Old Line

Bank and Bay Bank, Bay Bank will be merged with and into Old Line Bank, with Old Line Bank as the surviving bank, which we refer to
as the bank merger; and

 
· Eric D. Hovde, Joseph J. Thomas and Steven K. Breeden will be elected as members of the Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank

boards of directors.
 

Assuming the requisite approval of Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders and Bay Bancorp’s stockholders and the satisfaction of other
conditions to closing, we currently expect the merger to close in the second quarter of 2018. The merger will result in an institution with pro forma
assets approaching $3.0 billion and, with 39 full service banking offices serving Baltimore City and 11 Maryland counties, the combined institution
will have the second-most banking locations in Maryland of all independent Maryland-based commercial banks. Old Line Bancshares expects the
merger to be immediately accretive to its earnings, excluding merger expenses.

Background of the Merger
 

Old Line Bancshares regularly considers strategic acquisitions to the extent such opportunities arise and the institutions in question have
businesses and cultures complimentary to Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank. On April 22, 2010, Old Line Bancshares appointed a special
committee of its board of directors (later reconstituted as a joint committee of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank) to review potential strategic
opportunities in general (the “Strategic Opportunities Committee”), which at that time included consideration of the acquisition of Maryland
Bankcorp or Maryland Bank and Trust Company, N.A. Since its formation, the Strategic Opportunities Committee has considered potential
acquisitions on an ongoing basis.

 
Bay Bancorp’s board of directors formally began considering the possibility of a strategic combination with another financial institution at

its annual strategic planning meeting held on October 26, 2016, at which Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW”) made a presentation about the
then-current merger market and potential opportunities. Subsequently, the board determined to seek additional investment banking advice and
information regarding the current merger market and related matters from KBW and Hovde Group. Bay Bancorp has long histories of collaboration
with both KBW, who has advised Bay Bancorp on a variety of matters over the years, and Hovde Group, whose Chief Executive Officer (Steven
Hovde) is also a director of Bay Bancorp.

 
Both of these firms gave presentations to the Bay Bancorp board of directors on March 29, 2017. KBW was represented by David Lazar and

Adam Tarvin, and Hovde Group was represented by Steven Hovde, Michael Corso and Jason Blumberg.
 
At its meeting held on April 6, 2017, the Bay Bancorp board discussed these presentations and determined to appoint a special committee of

independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to further interview investment banking firms and make a recommendation to the board with
respect to the firm that would be the most appropriate fit for Bay Bancorp.

 
On April 13, 2017, the Special Committee held its first meeting, during which its members discussed the purpose for which the Special

Committee was formed and the objectives and framework for an evaluation and recommendation of an investment banking firm. After discussing the
presentations provided by KBW and Hovde Group, the Special Committee concluded that it should interview a third firm and selected RP Financial
as the third candidate. The decision to interview RP Financial was based on the fact that RP Financial had recently served as the financial advisor to
two other financial institutions that engaged in merger transactions with Old Line Bancshares, the Special Committee’s familiarity with RP Financial
on account of the fact that it served as the financial advisor to a financial institution with which Bay Bancorp had recently merged, and RP
Financial’s favorable reputation in the Mid-Atlantic market.

 
Following that meeting, Bay Bancorp’s legal counsel, Andrew Bulgin of Gordon Feinblatt LLC, contacted James Hennessey of RP

Financial for the purpose of having RP Financial execute a confidentiality agreement. RP Financial signed and delivered its confidentiality agreement
on April 13, 2017, after which Mr. Bulgin disclosed to Mr. Hennessey the identity of Bay Bancorp and the reasons for which the Special Committee
desired to interview RP Financial.

 
On April 19, 2017, the Special Committee convened a meeting for the purpose of interviewing RP Financial. Following that interview, the

members of the Special Committee discussed their impressions of the three investment banking candidates but did not make any formal
recommendation.

 
The next meeting of the Special Committee occurred on April 25, 2017. At that meeting, the three investment banking proposals were again

discussed and, although no formal recommendation was made, the Special Committee agreed to limit the candidates to KBW and Hovde Group,
subject to some additional investigation of those two firms. When comparing the three candidates and making this decision, the Special Committee
considered, among other things, the structure and competitiveness of the fee proposals, the number, size and geographic markets of the financial
institution transactions in which each of the candidates had recently acted as an investment banker, and their roles in those transactions.

 
On April 26, 2017, the Bay Bancorp board of directors met to discuss the status of the Special Committee’s investigation and, more

generally, whether moving forward with a strategic transaction at that time was appropriate. After a thorough discussion of the then-current stock and
merger market conditions, the possibility of income tax reform and the uncertainty that such reform presented, and the recent and anticipated
financial performance of Bay Bancorp, the board concluded to delay the process of investigating a strategic transaction until further notice.

At an executive session of the Bay Bancorp board of directors held on May 24, 2017, the board resumed its discussion and consideration of

the feasibility of pursuing a strategic transaction. Following that discussion, it was determined that Bay Bancorp should resume its exploration
efforts.

 
On June 2, 2017, the Special Committee convened a meeting for the purpose of further interviewing Hovde Group.
 
On June 5, 2017, the Special Committee convened a meeting for the purpose of making a final recommendation to the Bay Bancorp board

with respect to an investment banking firm. At the conclusion of that meeting, the Special Committee voted to recommend Hovde Group to the
board.

 
The Bay Bancorp board of directors met on June 8, 2017 to receive the Special Committee’s report and recommendation, after which the

board approved the engagement of Hovde Group and authorized Hovde Group to begin its marketing process.
 
Hovde Group provided a draft of its engagement letter to BYBK on June 8, 2017. Between June 12, 2017 and June 22, 2017, Bay Bancorp

and Hovde Group negotiated the final terms of that letter. Bay Bancorp and Hovde Group entered into the engagement letter on June 22, 2017.
 
On June 26, 2017, James W. Cornelsen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Old Line Bancshares, met with Joseph J. Thomas,

President and Chief Executive Officer of Bay Bancorp, at FIG’s Community Bank Forum in Nashville, Tennessee. During this meeting, Messrs.
Cornelsen and Thomas discussed their respective organizations. At the conclusion of that meeting, Messrs. Cornelsen and Thomas agreed that it
would be worthwhile to engage in further discussions once a confidentiality agreement was in place. Later that day, Michael P. Corso, Managing
Director of Hovde Group, provided Mr. Cornelsen with a confidentiality agreement. Execution of this agreement was a precondition to Hovde Group
sharing a Confidential Information Memorandum regarding Bay Bancorp.

 
Between June 8, 2017 and July 17, 2017, Hovde Group contacted 17 potential strategic partners on a no-name basis to gauge their interest in

a potential transaction with Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp, through Hovde Group, entered into confidentiality agreements with five other financial
institutions between June 26, 2017 and July 21, 2017. The confidentiality agreements, among other things, included traditional standstill provisions
that prohibit the five other financial institutions, without the consent of Bay Bancorp, from (i) submitting a proposal for any transaction between
them and Bay Bancorp or its stockholders, other than a proposal to the Bay Bancorp’s board of directors at the board’s invitation, (ii) acquiring,
offering to acquire or encouraging or assisting someone else to acquire, more than 5% of Bay Bancorp’s outstanding voting securities, and (iii)
making or participating in any solicitation of proxies to vote or attempting to influence any person or entity with respect to voting any securities of
Bay Bancorp, in each case for a period of one or two years from the date of the confidentiality agreement. The confidentiality agreements did not,
however, prevent these institutions from requesting a waiver of these provisions, commonly known as a “don’t ask” provision.

 
Between June 26, 2017 and July 6, 2017, Old Line Bancshares and Hovde Group negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement.
 
On July 5, 2017, Mr. Cornelsen informed the Old Line Bancshares/Old Line Bank executive management team of the possibility of entering

into due diligence of and negotiations with Bay Bancorp for Old Line Bancshares’ acquisition of Bay Bancorp. The executive management team was
comprised of Joseph Burnett, our former Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, Elise Hubbard, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, John Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, and Mark Semanie, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
Officer, as well as Mr. Cornelsen. On the same day, Mr. Cornelsen, on behalf of Old Line Bancshares, contacted Matthew Veneri of FIG Partners
LLC to assist with the financial analysis and negotiations regarding Bay Bancorp.

 
On July 6, 2017, Mr. Cornelsen signed and returned the confidentiality agreement to Hovde Group. Later that same day, Mr. Corso sent the

Confidential Information Memorandum regarding Bay Bancorp to Mr. Cornelsen, which contained certain public and non-public financial
information regarding Bay Bancorp and information regarding the timing and expected terms associated with the submission of any indications of
interest regarding an acquisition of Bay Bancorp.

On July 26, 2017, FIG presented financial analysis and market reports regarding a potential Old Line Bancshares/Bay Bancorp merger to the

Old Line Bancshares Strategic Opportunities Committee. Initial pricing with respect to such a transaction was in the range of $10.75 to $12.00 per
share with a focus on a price of $11.00. Following these presentations and discussion by the committee along with FIG, the Strategic Opportunities
Committee determined to continue moving forward with an acquisition of Bay Bancorp at $11.40 per share.

 
On July 28, 2017, Mr. Veneri, on behalf of Old Line Bancshares, sent Hovde Group an initial non-binding letter of interest with respect to

Old Line Bancshares’ acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Bay Bancorp. In its letter, Old Line Bancshares proposed a transaction
in which the value assigned to each share of Bay Bancorp common stock and options to purchase common stock would be $11.40 per share, for a
total purchase price of approximately $122.6 million, payable in shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock. Old Line Bancshares also proposed
that three members of the Bay Bancorp board of directors, mutually selected by Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, would join the board of
directors of Old Line Bancshares, as well as a 60-day exclusivity period.

 
Also on July 28, 2017, Bay Bancorp, through Hovde Group, received non-binding letters of interest from four of the other institutions with

which it had entered into confidentiality agreements.
 
On July 28, 2017, Hovde Group communicated the key terms of the five letters of interest to Eric Hovde (Chairman of the Board of Bay

Bancorp) and Mr. Thomas. On July 31, 2017, Hovde Group discussed the key terms of the letters of interest with a broader group including Eric
Hovde, Mr. Thomas, Steven Hovde (director of Bay Bancorp and CEO of Hovde Group), Jason Blumberg, Michael Corso and Austin Ellert (Hovde
Group). On August 3, 2017, Hovde Group participated in a conference call with Bay Bancorp’s board of directors to update the board with respect to
the process and review the letters of interest. Following this conference call, the board recommended that Bay Bancorp enter into exclusive
negotiations with Old Line Bancshares.

 
In evaluating the five letters of interest, Bay Bancorp and Hovde Group reviewed the key terms of the proposals, including the price, price

protection, consideration mix and board representation, alongside each potential buyer’s historical and projected operating and stock market
performance, including its profitability, credit profile, capital position and stock liquidity. Based on that review, Bay Bancorp and Hovde Group
determined that a merger with Old Line Bancshares would offer superior value to Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, both immediately and in the future,
than a merger with any of the other four institutions. In addition, the Bay Bancorp board of directors and Hovde Group considered the execution risk
associated with each of the proposals and concluded that a transaction with Old Line Bancshares was likely to receive regulatory and stockholder
approval and close in a timely manner. Following that discussion, representatives from Hovde Group contacted the four other institutions to provide
feedback on their respective proposals and to give them an opportunity to revise their terms. None of the four institutions opted to revise their
proposals.

 
On or about July 31, 2017, Hovde Group notified Old Line Bancshares that Bay Bancorp desired to explore a possible transaction with Old

Line Bancshares based on its initial letter of interest. Between that date and August 4, 2017, Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares, together with
their respective legal counsel and financial advisers, negotiated the final terms of the letter of interest, including the proposed pricing terms. During
that same period, the parties conducted preliminary due diligence on each other.

 
On August 4, 2017, based on the discussions of the parties, Mr. Veneri, on behalf of Old Line Bancshares, sent Hovde Group a revised

indication of interest with respect to the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Bay Bancorp, which increased the
assigned value of the Bay Bancorp common stock and options to purchase common stock to $11.80 per share, for a total purchase price of
approximately $126.9 million, and included Old Line Bancshares’ willingness to increase the merger consideration by the amount of any after-tax
income recognized by Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, prior to the closing of the proposed transaction, upon the settlement or other resolution of certain
pending litigation and the resolution of certain loans classified as Classified Assets as of the date thereof to the extent such income exceeded the
carrying value of such loans, with certain limitations as further discussed below. The revised indication of interest also provided that employees of
Bay Bancorp and/or Bay Bank that were not offered employment with Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank after closing of the potential
transaction, or that were involuntarily terminated within six months thereof, and who were not subject to a change in control agreement, would
receive a severance payment from Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of Bay Bank’s severance
policy. Finally, the revised indication of interest reduced the exclusivity period to 45 days.

After the parties executed the final letter of interest on August 4, 2017, the parties then began formal due diligence of each other.
 
Between August 8, 2017 and August 25, 2017, Old Line Bancshares, along with its financial advisers and attorneys, conducted formal due

diligence of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank. On August 25, 2017, Old Line Bancshares’ due diligence team met and concluded that no items arose
during the due diligence process that would lead to the conclusion that negotiations should be terminated or that the pricing should be revised.

 
On September 2, 2017, Old Line Bancshares circulated an initial draft of the merger agreement to Bay Bancorp for review.
 
On September 7, 2017, Old Line Bancshares requested that Bay Bancorp execute an extension to the exclusivity period contained in its

letter of interest, which was scheduled to expire on September 18, 2017.
 
In light of the affiliation of a director of Bay Bancorp (Steven D. Hovde) with Hovde Group, Bay Bancorp’s board of directors determined

on September 7, 2017 to seek a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm. Based on the Special Committee’s favorable
assessment of RP Financial’s analytical skill-set and familiarity with the pricing and other terms of recent bank mergers in the Mid-Atlantic market,
the board authorized Mr. Bulgin to contact RP Financial to request a fairness opinion proposal. On that date, Mr. Bulgin contacted James Hennessey
of RP Financial to request the proposal, and Mr. Hennessey provided such proposal on September 8, 2017. Between September 7, 2017 and
September 13, 2017, Mr. Bulgin and Mr. Thomas engaged in additional discussions with Mr. Hennessey to request revisions to the fee provisions of
RP Financial’s fairness opinion proposal. Mr. Hennessey submitted a first revised proposal on September 12, 2017. On September 13, 2017, Mr.
Hennessey submitted a second revised proposal to Mr. Thomas, which Bay Bancorp accepted on that date.

 
On September 8, 2017, Hovde Group received an unsolicited revised non-binding letter of interest from one of the other institutions with

which it had entered into a confidentiality agreement. In light of the exclusivity agreement with Old Line Bancshares, Hovde Group did not engage
in any discussions on Bay Bancorp’s behalf with this institution.

 
On September 11, 2017, Old Line Bancshares’ Strategic Opportunities Committee met to discuss the progress of negotiations, updated

pricing and discussions regarding Bay Bancorp’s requests for filling the three board seats that had been offered.
 
On September 11, 2017, the board of directors of Bay Bancorp convened a meeting for the purpose of discussing the revised letter of

interest from the other institution and determining whether, in light of that letter of interest, to extend the term of the Old Line Bancshares exclusivity
period as requested by Old Line Bancshares on September 7, 2017. During that meeting, the directors, after consulting with management and Hovde
Group, the board of directors concluded that the terms and conditions set forth in Old Line Bancshares’ letter of interest were significantly more
favorable than those set forth in the revised letter of interest and that pursuing a transaction with Old Line Bancshares presented significantly less
execution risk. Accordingly, the board of directors approved the extension of the term of the Old Line Bancshares exclusivity period through
September 25, 2017.

 
Beginning September 11, 2017 and concluding on September 25, 2017, Bay Bancorp, along with its financial advisers and attorneys,

conducted due diligence of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank.
 
On September 15, 2017, Old Line Bancshares and FIG formalized their working agreement by entering into a written agreement with

respect to FIG acting as Old Line Bancshares’ financial advisor with respect to the merger.
 
On September 15, 2017, Hovde Group received another unsolicited non-binding letter of interest from the other financial institution. Hovde

Group did not respond to this institution, but it did send that to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors who reviewed it and nevertheless concluded that a
decision to pursue a transaction with Old Line Bancshares as contemplated by its letter of interest continued to present Bay Bancorp’s stockholders
with the best short- and long-term opportunities.

 
Between September 2, 2017 and September 27, 2017, Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, with the assistance of their respective legal

counsel and financial advisers, continued with their due diligence efforts and negotiated the final terms of the merger agreement and the ancillary
documents appearing as exhibits to the merger agreement.

During its meeting on September 26, 2017, Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors considered the definitive merger agreement and

ancillary documents, and at which representatives of FIG and Mr. Bonaventure of Baker Donelson, Old Line Bancshares’ outside counsel, were also
present. Mr. Bonaventure presented the board with an overview of the material terms of the merger agreement, copies of which were provided to
each director before the meeting. Also at this meeting, Mr. Veneri of FIG reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and presented FIG’s
fairness opinion. At the conclusion of these presentations, and discussion and deliberation among the directors, and after considering all of the factors
that it deemed relevant, the Old Line Bancshares board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, up to and including the merger, approved the form of the related support agreement, declared the merger advisable, and
authorized Old Line Bancshares’ President and Chief Executive Officer to execute and deliver the definitive merger agreements and the support
agreements.

 
On September 27, 2017, the Bay Bancorp board of directors held a meeting for the purposes of (i) receiving management’s report with

respect to its due diligence review of Old Line Bancshares and views regarding the synergies between the two companies and anticipated benefits of
the merger, (ii) receiving a fairness opinion analysis from each of Hovde Group and RP Financial, (iii) reviewing the final terms of the merger
agreement, and (iv) voting on the approval of the merger and related transactions. All directors were present except for Mark Caplan, who was in
Europe and not available to participate but who, by e-mail to Mr. Thomas on September 26, 2017, confirmed that, absent any material developments,
he was in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. Because he was not present (in person or by telephone) at the meeting, however, Bay
Bancorp could not and did not treat Mr. Caplan’s communication as a vote on the merger agreement and the merger. Also in attendance were Mr.
Bulgin, Mr. Hennessey, who presented RP Financial’s final fairness opinion, and Jason Blumberg, who presented Hovde Group’s fairness opinion.
Following their delivery of the fairness opinion analyses by Messrs. Blumberg and Hennessey and related questions from the board, Mr. Bulgin
reviewed each term of the merger agreement with the board and answered various questions regarding the merger agreement. Following these
presentations and discussions, and after considering the opinions of RP Financial and Hovde Group, the Bay Bancorp board of directors declared the
merger and the merger agreement to be advisable and in the best interests of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders and approved the merger agreement, the
merger and the related transactions. Steven D. Hovde abstained from this vote due to his ownership interest in and position as President and Chief
Executive Officer of Hovde Group; Eric D. Hovde has no financial interest in or other affiliation with Hovde Group.

 
The parties executed the merger agreement on September 27, 2017.
 
Following the close of trading markets on September 27, 2017, Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares issued a joint press release

announcing the approval, adoption and execution of the merger agreement.
 

Old Line Bancshares’ Reasons for the Merger
 

In evaluating acquisition opportunities, Old Line Bancshares looks for financial institutions with business philosophies that are similar to
those of Old Line Bancshares and that operate in markets that geographically complement its operations. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, Old
Line Bancshares also considers its long-range strategies, including financial, customer and employee strategies. Old Line Bancshares, from time to
time, reviews its strategic plan to analyze its geographic scope, financial performance and growth opportunities. Since its acquisition of Maryland
Bankcorp in 2011, WSB in 2013 and Regal Bancorp in 2015, and before and during its acquisition of DCB in July 2017, Old Line Bancshares has
considered a number of opportunities to expand its presence in its primary market areas and, as appropriate, areas contiguous to its current market
areas; however management and the Strategic Opportunities Committee concluded that the acquisition of Bay Bancorp was the best current
opportunity to further this business objective. In connection with its approval of the merger with Bay Bancorp, Old Line Bancshares’ board of
directors reviewed the terms of the proposed acquisition and definitive agreements and their potential impact on Old Line Bancshares’ constituencies.
In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors considered a number of factors,
including the following:

 
· The acquisition of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank represents an attractive opportunity for Old Line Bank to expand and strengthen its

presence in the Baltimore Metropolitan areas, following its initial entry into Baltimore County in December 2015 pursuant to its
acquisition of Regal Bancorp, while remaining a community bank;

 
· The results of due diligence of Bay Bancorp and its business operations, including asset quality;

 

 54  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 63/225

 

 
· The understanding of the business operations, management, financial condition, asset quality, product offerings and prospects of Bay

Bancorp based on, among other things, input from management and Old Line Bancshares’ financial advisor;
 

· The view that the combined company will have the potential for a stronger competitive position in a marketplace where relatively greater
size and scale is becoming increasingly more important factors for financial performance and success;

 
· The expectation that the merger would be immediately accretive to earnings (excluding merger expenses) in light of the potential cost

savings;
 

· Bay Bancorp’s emphasis on personal contact and service with local decision-making ability and a clear focus on the community and local
customers, which are consistent with Old Line Bancshares’ business approach;

 
· Bay Bancorp’s focus on serving the small and mid-size business sectors as well as individuals, which is consistent with Old Line

Bancshares’ client focus;
 

· The financial condition, operating results and future prospects of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp;
 

· Historical pro forma financial information on the merger, including, among other things, expectations for pro forma tangible book value
and pro forma earnings per share information, accretion/dilution analysis for tangible book value per share and earnings per share, pro
forma capital levels and capital impact of the transaction, and pro forma balance sheet composition, including pro forma loan and deposit
portfolio composition;

 
· A review of comparable transactions, including a comparison of the price being paid in the merger with the prices paid in other

comparable financial institution mergers from an earnings, deposit premium and tangible book value perspective; and
 

· Management’s view, based on, among other things, such comparable transactions reviewed, that the consideration paid by Old Line
Bancshares is fair to Old Line Bancshares and its stockholders from a financial point of view.

 
All business combinations, including the merger, also include certain risks and disadvantages. The material potential risks and disadvantages

to Old Line Bancshares and its stockholders that Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors and management identified and the board of directors
considered include the following material matters, the order of which does not necessarily reflect their relative significance:

 
· Execution risk; and

 
· The risk that projected earnings increases and/or cost savings will not materialize or will be less than expected.

 
The discussion and factors considered by Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes all material

factors considered. Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors considered these factors as a whole, and considered them to be favorable to, and
supportive of, its determination. Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors did not consider it practical, nor did it attempt, to quantify, rank or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its decision. In considering the factors described above,
individual members of Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors may have given different weights or priority to different factors. Old Line
Bancshares’ board of directors realized there can be no assurance about future results, including results expected or considered in the factors listed
above. The board of directors concluded, however, that the potential positive factors outweighed the potential risks of completing the merger.

 
After deliberating with respect to the proposed merger with Bay Bancorp, considering, among other things, the factors discussed above and

the opinion of FIG discussed below, the Old Line Bancshares board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger with Bay Bancorp
and declared the merger advisable.

 
There can be no certainty that the above benefits of the merger anticipated by the Old Line Bancshares board of directors will occur. Actual

results may vary materially from those anticipated. For more information on the factors that could affect actual results, see “Caution Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

Bay Bancorp’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors
 

The Bay Bancorp board of directors concluded that the merger offers Bay Bancorp’s stockholders an attractive opportunity to achieve the
board’s strategic business objectives, including increasing stockholder value, growing the size of the business and enhancing liquidity for
stockholders. In addition, the board believes that both the customers and communities served by Bay Bank will enjoy significant benefits from the
merger that they might not otherwise enjoy if Bay Bank were to remain independent or merge with another bank.

 
In deciding to approve the merger, the Bay Bancorp board of directors consulted with management, as well as its legal counsel and financial

advisors, and considered numerous factors, including the following:
 
· Information with respect to the businesses, earnings, operations, financial condition, prospects, capital levels and asset quality of Bay

Bank and Old Line Bank, both individually and as a combined company;
 

· The perceived risks and uncertainties attendant to Bay Bank’s operation as an independent banking organization, including the risks and
uncertainties related to the low interest rate environment, competition in Bay Bank’s market area, and the increased regulatory costs and
increased capital requirements that will likely result from new and pending laws and regulations;

 
· The historical, current and prospective merger market and the board’s belief, based on, among other information, Hovde Group’s and RP

Financial’s presentations, that the value to be received by Bay Bancorp’s stockholders in the merger is compelling and that future merger
opportunities for Bay Bancorp might not be as favorable as the opportunity presented by Old Line Bancshares’ offer;

 
· The market values of Bay Bancorp’s common stock and Old Line Bancshares’ common stock prior to the execution of the merger

agreement and the immediate value of the merger to Bay Bancorp’s stockholders given the merger consideration’s significant premium
over the then-current trading price of the shares of Bay Bancorp’s common stock;

 
· The potential long-term value to be realized by Bay Bancorp’s stockholders as a result of the merger as compared to stockholder value

projected for Bay Bancorp as an independent entity, and the prospects for future appreciation of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock as a
result of its strategic initiatives;

 
· Old Line Bancshares’ strategies to remain independent and to seek profitable future expansion, which it expected to lead to continued

growth in overall stockholder value;
 

· The enhanced liquidity for stockholders of Bay Bancorp as a result of receiving shares of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock given the
current trading market for Old Line Bancshares’ common stock;

 
· The culture and business model of Old Line Bank, which the Bay Bancorp board of directors believes are complimentary to Bay Bank’s

culture and business model, and the perceived competence, experience and community banking philosophy of Old Line Bank’s
management team, both of which the board believed should increase the likelihood that Bay Bank will be successfully integrated with Old
Line Bank;

 
· Old Line Bank’s commitment to retain as many employees of Bay Bank as practical, and its agreement to honor Bay Bank’s change in

control severance arrangements and provide severance benefits to other terminated employees that are consistent with Bay Bank’s
employee severance policy;

 
· Bay Bank’s attractive geographic footprint, strong client relationships, talented team of associates, diverse loan portfolio, low-cost core

deposits and solid fee-based revenues, all of which the board of directors believes should complement and strengthen Old Line Bank’s
high-performing franchise; and

 
· Old Line Bank’s successful acquisition track record and the belief that the merger will be approved by the parties’ banking regulators

without undue burden and in a timely manner.
 

 56  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 65/225

 

 
The Bay Bancorp board of directors also considered potential risks associated with the merger when makings its decision to approve the

merger agreement, including:
 
· The risk that the terms of the merger agreement, including the provisions generally prohibiting Bay Bancorp from soliciting, engaging in

discussions or providing information with respect to alternative transactions, and those relating to the payment of a termination fee under
specified circumstances, which were required by Old Line Bancshares as a condition to its willingness to enter into the transaction, could
have the effect of discouraging other parties that might be interested in a transaction with Bay Bancorp from proposing such a transaction;

 
· The risk of an all-stock transaction in the event that Old Line Bancshares’ stock price declines significantly after the merger is completed;

 
· The challenges of combining the businesses of the two companies, which could affect the post-merger success of the combined company,

and the ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and other potential benefits of the merger;
 

· The risk that the merger would not be completed, leaving Bay Bancorp’s reputation severely damaged;
 

· The risk that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders and the community react negatively to the loss of the local community bank; and
 

· The risk that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, the community, and customers react negatively to the job eliminations that will be required to
achieve the anticipated cost savings from the merger.

 
In the judgment of the Bay Bancorp’s board of directors, the potential benefits of the merger outweigh these potential risks.
 
The above discussion of the information and factors considered by Bay Bancorp’s board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but it

does include a description of all material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the board of directors
in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the board did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors that it considered. In considering these factors, individual directors may have given differing weights to
different factors. Bay Bancorp’s board of directors made a collective determination with respect to the merger, based on the conclusion reached by its
members and the factors that each of them considered appropriate, that the merger is in the best interests of the stockholders of Bay Bancorp.

 
Opinion of Old Line Bancshares’ Financial Advisor
 

Old Line Bancshares retained FIG by letter agreement dated September 15, 2017, to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible
business combination with Bay Bancorp. As part of its engagement, FIG delivered to the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares its opinion dated
September 27, 2017 that, based upon and subject to the various considerations set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to
the stockholders of Bay Bancorp is fair to the stockholders of Old Line Bancshares from a financial point of view. In requesting FIG’s advice and
opinion, no limitations were imposed by Old Line Bancshares upon FIG with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in
rendering its opinion. The full text of the opinion of FIG, which describe the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken, is attached hereto as Annex B. Old Line Bancshares stockholders should read these opinions in their
entirety.

 
FIG is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking business, it values financial institutions in

connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and for other purposes. As a specialist in securities of financial institutions, FIG has
experience in, and knowledge of, banks, thrifts and bank and thrift holding companies. Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors selected FIG to act as
its financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of the firm’s reputation and expertise in transactions such as the merger.

 
Pursuant to the engagement letter, Old Line Bancshares paid FIG a non-refundable fairness opinion fee of $100,000 upon its delivery of the

fairness opinion. Upon the closing of the merger, Old Line Bancshares will pay FIG a success fee equal to 0.75% of the value of the merger
consideration; upon Old Line Bancshares’ request, the fairness opinion fee will be credited against the success fee. Further, Old Line Bancshares has
agreed to reimburse FIG’s out-of-pocket expenses, in an amount not to exceed $10,000, incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify

As part of its investment banking business, FIG is routinely engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with

mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bidding, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, FIG has experience and knowledge of
the valuation of banking institutions. FIG’s opinion has been reviewed by FIG’s compliance officer consistent with its internal policy. In the last two
years FIG has not previously provided any services or received compensation from Old Line Bancshares. FIG has not previously provided any
services or received compensation from Bay Bancorp.

 
FIG’s opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration, and, as such, does not

constitute a recommendation to any Old Line Bancshares stockholder as to how the stockholder should vote at the Old Line Bancshares
special stockholder meeting. The summary of the opinion of FIG set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion.

 
The following is a summary of the analyses performed by FIG in connection with its fairness opinion. Certain analyses were confirmed in a

presentation to the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares by FIG. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of
either the analyses performed by FIG in rendering its opinion or the presentation delivered by FIG to the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares,
but it does summarize all of the material analyses performed and presented by FIG.

 
The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses

and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. In arriving at its opinion, FIG did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. FIG may
have given various analyses more or less weight than other analyses. Accordingly, FIG believes that its analyses and the following summary must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering all factors, could create an incomplete view of the process
underlying the analyses set forth in its report to the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares and its fairness opinion.

 
In performing its analyses, FIG made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic

conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Old Line Bancshares. The analyses performed by FIG are not necessarily
indicative of actual value or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses
were prepared solely as part of FIG’s analysis of the fairness of the transaction consideration, from a financial point of view, to Old Line Bancshares’
stockholders. The analyses do not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which
any securities may trade at the present time or at any time in the future. FIG’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared
to any other business combination in which Old Line Bancshares might engage. In addition, as described above, FIG’s opinion was one of many
factors taken into consideration by the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.

 
During the course of its engagement, and as a basis for arriving at its opinion, FIG reviewed and analyzed material bearing upon the

financial and operating conditions of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp and material prepared in connection with the merger, including, among
other things, the following:

 
 (i) reviewed the merger agreement and terms of the merger;
   
 (ii) reviewed certain documents filed with the SEC by Old Line Bancshares;
   
 (iii) reviewed the audited financial statements for Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp for the years 2016 and 2015;
   

 
(iv) reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp

including, among other things, quarterly reports filed by the parties with the FDIC and the FRB;

 (v) reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp;
   
 (vi) reviewed recent trading activity and the market for Old Line Bancshares common stock;
   
 (vii) analyzed certain financial projections prepared by the management of Bay Bancorp;
   

 

(viii) held discussions with members of the senior management of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp for the purpose of reviewing the future
prospects of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp, including the respective businesses, assets, liabilities and the amount and timing of
cost savings (the “Synergies”) expected to be achieved as a result of the merger;

   

 
(ix) reviewed the terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions, to the extent publicly available, involving banks and bank holding

companies that FIG considered relevant; and
   
 (x) performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as it have deemed appropriate.

 
FIG also took into account its assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions as

well as its knowledge of the banking industry and its general experience in securities valuation.
 
In rendering its opinion, FIG has assumed and relied on, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial

and other information and representations contained in the financials and other materials provided to, or discussed with, it by Old Line Bancshares
and Bay Bancorp or publicly available, including median publicly available analyst earnings estimates for Old Line Bancshares for the years ending
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. In that regard, FIG assumed that the financial analysis provided to, or discussed with, it by Old Line
Bancshares or made available by Bay Bancorp or derived therefrom, including, without limitation, the Synergies and other financial forecasts, have
been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available information and judgments of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp. FIG
is not an expert in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for losses with respect thereto
and has assumed that such allowances for Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp are in the aggregate adequate to cover such losses. FIG was not
retained to and did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or facilities of Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp. In addition, FIG
has not reviewed individual credit files or made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Old Line Bancshares or Bay
Bancorp or any of their respective subsidiaries and was not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.

No company used as a comparison in the above analysis is identical to Bay Bancorp. The peer analysis detailed above was used to compare

the operating and financial performance of Bay Bancorp to companies of similar size and in similar operating markets. Accordingly, an analysis of
these results is not purely mathematical. Rather, it involves considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the companies and of the banking environment at the time of the opinion. Compared to its U.S. peers, Bay Bancorp’s asset quality
ratios and capital ratios are above the median, while earnings ratios are below the median. Compared to its regional peers, Bay Bancorp’s earnings
and asset quality ratios are in line with the median, while capital ratios are above the median.

 
The third group consisted of ten Nasdaq or NYSE listed U.S. commercial banks, headquartered in Washington D.C., Maryland, North

Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, with total assets between $2.0 billion and $7.5 billion. The table below displays selected financial information
and pricing ratios for the individual companies comprising the peer group, and compares the median values for the peer group with the values for the

FIG calculated the medians of the following relevant transaction ratios in the Comparable Transactions – National Comparable Transactions

– Mid-Atlantic and Comparable Transactions – D.C./Baltimore Corridor: the multiple of the offer value to the acquired company’s tangible book
value; the multiple of the offer value to the acquired company’s last twelve months net income; the multiple of the offer value to the acquired
company’s total assets; and the tangible book value premium to core deposits. FIG compared these multiples with the corresponding multiples for the
merger, valuing the total consideration that would be received pursuant to the merger agreement at approximately $127.96 million, or $11.80 per Bay
Bancorp share. In calculating the multiples for the merger, FIG used Bay Bancorp’s tangible book value, first half 2017 net income annualized and
total core deposits as of June 30, 2017. The results of this analysis are as follows:

The Comparable Transactions – National group suggested a range of value of $8.51 to $11.05, with a midpoint of $10.13. The Comparable

Transactions – Mid-Atlantic group suggested a range of value of $7.38 to $15.48, with a midpoint of $12.18. The Comparable Transactions –
D.C./Baltimore Corridor group suggested a range of value of $9.33 to $15.34, with a midpoint of $12.21. FIG noted that the merger consideration of
$11.80 per share was within or slightly above the range of values suggested by the comparable transaction analysis.

 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
 
FIG estimated the value of Bay Bancorp common stock by calculating the present value of its projected future earnings stream and projected

future equity. The analysis was based on Bay Bancorp’s internal projections, as adjusted by Old Line Bancshares and FIG for net income of $3.2
million, $5.9 million, $7.0 million, $8.3 million and $10.1 million for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

FIG applied a price to tangible book value multiple at ratios ranging from 180% to 220% of Bay Bancorp’s estimated tangible book value in
2021 and price to earnings multiple at ratios ranging 22 to 26 times Bay Bancorp’s 2021 estimated earnings to derive two unique terminal values.
The present value of these terminal amounts were then calculated based on a range of discount rates of 11% to 13%. The discount rates selected by
FIG were intended to reflect different assumptions regarding the required rates of return for holders of Bay Bancorp common stock. The present
value of the terminal values was then added to the present value of the earnings stream for 2017 through 2021 to derive a total value based on
discounted cash flows. The two analyses and the underlying assumptions yielded a range of values for Bay Bancorp stock.

(1) Based on Bay Bancorp shares outstanding of 10,713,832 as of June 30, 2017

 
FIG assigned the greatest significance to the terminal values represented by 200% of 2021 estimated tangible book value and 24 times 2021

estimated earnings. The consideration of $11.80 paid by Old Line Bancshares to Bay Bancorp is above the indicated range on a tangible book value
basis using a terminal multiple of 200% and within the indicated range using a price to earnings multiple of 24.0 times. When taking into account the
full range of discount rates and multiples, the consideration to be paid to Bay Bancorp falls within this range.

 
Pro Forma Financial Impact
 
FIG performed a pro forma merger analysis that combined projected income statement and balance sheet information of Old Line

Bancshares and Bay Bancorp. FIG analyzed the estimated financial impact of the merger on certain projected financial results for Old Line
Bancshares and Bay Bancorp and financial forecasts and projections relating to the earnings of Old Line Bancshares, which were derived by FIG
from publicly available consensus estimates, and Bay Bancorp, which were derived from projections prepared by Bay Bancorp management and
adjusted by Old Line Bancshares and FIG, and pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings
and related expenses), which, in the case of Old Line Bancshares were derived by FIG from publicly available information and, in the case of Bay
Bancorp, were derived by FIG from information prepared by Old Line Bancshares management. FIG discussed with Old Line Bancshares’
management each of the balance sheet estimates of Bay Bancorp and certain financial forecasts and projections relating to Bay Bancorp’s earnings.
This analysis indicated that the merger could be accretive to Old Line Bancshares estimated earnings per share in 2018 and have a less than two -year
payback period for Old Line Bancshares estimated tangible book value per share. For all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by Old
Line Bancshares following the merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

As described above, based upon the foregoing analyses and other investigations and assumptions set forth in its opinion, without

giving specific weightings to any one factor or comparison, FIG determined that the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders. FIG’s opinion and presentation to Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors were among the
many factors taken into consideration by Old Line Bancshares board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the
merger and to recommend that Old Line Bancshares stockholders approve the merger.

 
Opinion of RP Financial - Bay Bancorp’s Financial Advisor
 

Bay Bancorp retained RP Financial on September 14, 2017 to render an opinion regarding the fairness from a financial point of view with
respect to the merger consideration to be received by Bay Bancorp’s stockholders in the merger. In engaging RP Financial for its fairness opinion, the
Bay Bancorp board of directors did not give any special instructions to RP Financial, nor did it impose any limitations upon the scope of the
investigation that RP Financial wished to conduct to enable it to give its opinion. RP Financial has delivered to Bay Bancorp its written opinion,
dated September 27, 2017, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein and other matters it considered relevant, as of that
date, the merger consideration to be received in connection with the merger with Old Line Bancshares is fair to the Bay Bancorp stockholders from a
financial point of view. The opinion of RP Financial is directed to the board of directors of Bay Bancorp in its consideration of the merger agreement,
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Bay Bancorp as to any action that such stockholder should take in connection with
the merger agreement or otherwise. RP Financial’s opinion is directed only to the fairness of the merger consideration to the current stockholders of
Bay Bancorp from a financial point of view as of the date of the merger agreement. A copy of the RP Financial opinion is set forth as Annex C to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, and Bay Bancorp stockholders should read it in its entirety. RP Financial has consented to the inclusion and
description of its written opinion in this proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Bay Bancorp selected RP Financial to render an independent fairness opinion because of RP Financial’s expertise in the valuation of

businesses and their securities for a variety of purposes, including its expertise in connection with mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions.
Pursuant to a letter agreement executed by Bay Bancorp on September 14, 2017, RP Financial estimates that it will receive from Bay Bancorp total
professional fees of approximately $85,000, $80,000 of which has been paid to date, plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses, for its
services in connection with the merger.

 
RP Financial has not previously rendered any services to or received compensation from Bay Bancorp or Old Line Bancshares.
 
In addition, Bay Bancorp has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless RP Financial, any affiliates of RP Financial, and the respective

directors, officers, agents and employees of RP Financial or their successors and assigns who act for or on behalf of RP Financial in connection with
the services called for under Bay Bancorp’s engagement letter with RP Financial, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including, but not limited to, all losses and expenses in connection with claims under the federal securities laws), actually incurred by RP Financial
and attributable to: (i) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the financial statements or other information furnished or otherwise
provided by an authorized officer of Bay Bancorp to RP Financial; (ii) the omission of a material fact from the financial statements or other
information furnished or otherwise made available by an authorized officer of Bay Bancorp to RP Financial; or (iii) any action or omission to act by
Bay Bancorp, or Bay Bancorp’s respective officers, directors, employees or agents, which action or omission is willful. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Bay Bancorp will be under no obligation to indemnify RP Financial hereunder if a court determines that RP Financial was negligent or
acted in bad faith or willfully with respect to any actions or omissions of RP Financial related to a matter for which indemnification is sought.

 
In addition, if RP Financial is entitled to indemnification from Bay Bancorp and in connection therewith incurs legal expenses in defending

any legal action challenging the opinion of RP Financial where RP Financial is not negligent or otherwise at fault or is found by a court of law to be
not negligent or otherwise at fault, Bay Bancorp will indemnify RP Financial for all reasonable expenses.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 75/225

 

 
In rendering its opinion, RP Financial reviewed the following material and conducted the following analyses with respect to the merger

agreement and Bay Bancorp:
 

· the merger agreement, as reviewed by the Bay Bancorp board of directors on September 27, 2017, and certain exhibits;
 

· the following financial information for Bay Bancorp: (i) audited consolidated financial statements, included in the annual reports
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2016; (ii) unaudited consolidated financial data, including
stockholder reports and financial statements through June 30, 2017, (iii) quarterly financial reports submitted to the FDIC by Bay
Bank through June 30, 2017; (iv) historical publicly-available financial information as published by S&P Global Market
Intelligence; and (v) internally prepared budget and strategic planning information;

 
· the financial terms of certain other recently completed and pending acquisitions of banks headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic region

of the United States with comparable financial characteristics as Bay Bancorp;
 

· the financial terms of certain other recently completed and pending acquisitions of banks headquartered in the states of Maryland,
Virginia and Delaware as well as the District of Columbia with comparable financial characteristics as Bay Bancorp;

 
· the estimated pro forma financial benefits of the merger to Bay Bancorp stockholders; and

 
· in person interviews with senior executive officers of Bay Bancorp.

 
In addition, RP Financial reviewed or considered the following materials or information for Old Line Bancshares and as further described

below certain peers of Old Line Bancshares:
 

· the annual audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended 2012 to 2016, as presented in Old Line Bancshares’ Annual
Report on Form 10-K filings;

 
· the quarterly financial reports submitted to the FDIC by Old Line Bank from March 31, 2016 through June 30, 2017;

 
· internally prepared budget information for Old Line Bancshares for 2017;

 
· stock price history for Old Line Bancshares during past 12 months;

 
· Old Line Bancshares financial information versus a peer group of comparable publicly-traded institutions; and

 
· in person interviews with senior executives of Old Line Bancshares.

 
In rendering its opinion, RP Financial relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of the information

concerning Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares furnished by the respective institutions to RP Financial for review for purposes of its opinion, as
well as publicly-available information regarding other financial institutions and competitive, economic and demographic data. RP Financial further
relied on the assurances of management of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares as included in the merger agreement. RP Financial has not been
asked to undertake, and has not undertaken, an independent verification of any of such information and RP Financial does not assume any
responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. Bay Bancorp did not restrict RP Financial as to the material it was permitted to
review. RP Financial did not perform or obtain any independent appraisals or evaluations of the assets and liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Bay
Bancorp or Old Line Bancshares, the collateral securing any such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor has RP Financial
been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. RP Financial did not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for
loan losses of Bay Bancorp or Old Line Bancshares nor did RP Financial review any individual credit files relating to Bay Bancorp or Old Line
Bancshares.

 
RP Financial, with Bay Bancorp’s consent, has relied upon the advice that Bay Bancorp has received from its legal, accounting and tax

advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the merger agreement and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In
rendering its opinion, RP Financial assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory and governmental approvals for the proposed
merger, no restriction will be imposed on Old Line Bancshares that would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the merger to be
consummated as set forth in the merger agreement. RP Financial also assumed that there has been no material change in Bay Bancorp’s or Old Line
Bancshares’ assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statement that were
made available to RP Financial. RP Financial assumed, in all respects material to its analyses, that all of the representations and warranties contained
in the merger agreement and all related agreements are true and correct, that each party to such agreements will perform all of the covenants required
to be performed by such party under such agreements and that the conditions precedent in the merger agreement are not waived.

RP Financial’s opinion was based solely upon the information available to it and the economic, market and other circumstances as they

existed as of September 27, 2017. Events occurring after September 27, 2017 could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion dated September 27, 2017, RP Financial performed a variety of financial analyses that are summarized
below. Although the evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration was to some extent subjective based on the
experience and judgment of RP Financial and not merely the result of mathematical analyses of financial data, RP Financial relied, in part, on the
financial analyses summarized below in its determinations. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and RP Financial believes its
analyses must be considered as a whole. Selecting portions of such analyses and factors considered by RP Financial without considering all such
analyses and other factors could create an incomplete view of the process underlying RP Financial’s opinion. In its analyses, RP Financial took into
account its assessment of general business, market, monetary, financial and economic conditions, industry performance and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares, as well as RP Financial’s experience in securities valuation, its knowledge of
financial institutions, its knowledge of the current operating and merger and acquisition environments for financial institutions, and its experience in
similar transactions. With respect to the comparable transactions and control premium analyses described below, no public company utilized as a
comparison is identical to Bay Bancorp and such analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that could affect the acquisition values of the companies concerned. The
analyses were prepared solely for purposes of RP Financial providing its opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration, and they do not
purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in RP
Financial’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results of values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than such estimates.

 
Comparable Transactions Analysis
 
RP Financial compared the merger on the basis of the multiples or ratios of reported earnings, tangible book value and tangible book

premium to core deposits reported in a selected comparable group of completed and pending bank mergers and acquisitions. The Comparable
Transactions groups consisted of a sale of control transactions where the acquired company had the following characteristics: (i) based in the states of
Maryland, Virginia and Delaware as well as the District of Columbia announced during the period from September 23, 2015, to September 23, 2017,
involving targets with total assets between $200 million and $1.25 billion at the announcement date (the “Local Region Transactions”); and (ii) all
Mid-Atlantic transactions announced during the period from September 23, 2015 to September 23, 2017, involving targets with total assets between
$300 million and $1.25 billion at the announcement date (the “Mid-Atlantic Transactions”). The transactions comprising the Local Region
Transactions Group and the Mid-Atlantic Transactions are set forth below.

The average and median pricing multiples (Price/Tangible Book Value multiple, Price/Earnings multiple and Core Deposit Premium

multiple) of the Local Region Transactions group and Mid-Atlantic Transactions group were applied to Bay Bancorp’s actual financial measures
(tangible book value, core earnings and core deposits) to derive a valuation range before adjustments. The resulting valuation range was $10.00 to
$11.00 per share, which is below the merger consideration of $11.80 per share as of September 27, 2017.

 
Control Premium Analysis
 
The Control Premium Analysis applies a multiple to the pre-announcement fair market value or trading value of an acquisition target’s

common stock at various points in time (one-week and one-month prior to announcement) to derive a sale of control value for a share of the
acquisition target’s stock. It is a two-step process.

 
First, the fair market value of a minority ownership position (i.e., non-controlling) of Bay Bancorp common stock is estimated based on a

peer group of comparable publicly-traded companies. Then, a multiple is applied to the fair market value and the trading value of Bay Bancorp’s
stock based on control premium multiples paid in comparable transactions.

 
The fair market value of Bay Bancorp’s stock was based on the trading multiples of a group of comparable publicly-traded institutions (the

“Peer Group”). The Peer Group consisted of publicly-traded (listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange) group of commercial banks,
commercial bank holding companies, thrifts or savings and loan holding companies headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., with total
assets of between $300 million and $1 billion and which were profitable on a trailing 12-month basis through the quarter ended June 30, 2017. There
were a total of 13 institutions included in the Peer Group as follows:

share which approximated the recent trading of $7.75 per share on Nasdaq.
 
 
Relative to the Peer Group, RP Financial made downward valuation adjustments for Bay Bancorp’s less favorable credit quality and upward

valuation adjustments for the recent earnings growth trend and operations in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. RP Financial concluded
with a public equivalent value for Bay Bancorp equal to $8.00 per share.

 
Second, RP Financial conducted a Control Premium Analysis, which involved applying a control premium to the estimated Peer Group

based fair market value of Bay Bancorp stock RP Financial which equaled $8.00 per share as well as to the actual trading value of Bay Bancorp stock
as of September 22, 2017, which equaled $7.90 per share (Bay Bancorp’s stock traded on the Nasdaq Market) to arrive at a range of sale of control
values under this approach. The control premium applied was the median of the 1-week and one-month premiums paid over the trading value of the
stock (i.e., acquisition price at announcement divided by price of target one-week and one-month prior to announcement date involving selling
institutions with total assets between $250 million and $2 billion that announced a transaction over the 12-month period ending September 22, 2017).
RP Financial applied a range of control premiums from 33% to 38% to the range of trading values.

 
Applying this premium to the fair market value of Bay Bancorp’s stock that RP Financial derived and to the actual closing price of Bay

Bancorp’s stock as of September 27, 2017 resulted in a sale of control valuation range of $10.50 to $11.05 per share, which was below the value of
the merger consideration of $11.80 per share as of September 27, 2017.

 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
 
RP Financial evaluated the value per share of the current offer to the implied value of Bay Bancorp’s current business plan. In this regard,

RP Financial measured the present value per share of future dividends and the terminal value to Bay Bancorp’s current stockholders utilizing Bay
Bancorp’s five year strategic plan and financial projections which covered the five year period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. The
discounted cash flow analysis reflected the strategic plan assumptions as follows:

 
· Beginning balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 was utilized for modeling purposes;

 
' · Asset growth in the range of 7% to 8% annually and loan growth in the range of 9% annually;
 

· The projected return on average assets was projected to equal 0.86% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, to 1.15% for the 12
months ended June 30, 2022;

 
· No dividends or share repurchases were assumed; and

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 80/225

 

 
· Projected Bay Bancorp net income of $5.9 million for Year 1, $7.0 million for Year 2, $8.3 million for Year 3, $10.1 million for

Year 4, and $11.0 million for Year 5.
 
The discounted cash flow analysis reflected the following valuation assumptions and inputs:
 

· Fifth year terminal value multipliers for earnings per share were in a range of 22 to 26 times earnings per share while the fifth year
terminal value multipliers for tangible book value per share were in a range of 1.40 times to 1.70 times tangible book value per
share. These multipliers were selected by RP Financial, as they were consistent with the average and median values observed in the
bank merger transactions included in the Regional Transactions Group and the Mid-Atlantic Transactions Group in RP Financial’s
Comparable Transactions Analysis relative to the merger consideration to be received by the stockholders of Bay Bancorp.

 
· The cash flows were then discounted to present value using two discount rates, a low of 13.0% and a high of 15.0%. This range of

rates reflects RP Financial’s assessment of an investor’s annual return expectation for an investment in Bay Bancorp, based on RP
Financial’s application of the capital assets pricing model, which incorporated a risk-free rate and an estimated equity risk
premium, and its knowledge of investors’ return expectations for financial institutions with risk characteristics that are similar to
Bay Bancorp.

 
The present per share value generated by the discounted cash flow under these assumptions ranged from $9.25 per share to $12.00 per share.

The indicated range of value pursuant to the discounted cash flow approach was below the merger consideration of $11.80 per share as of September
27, 2017 at the low end of the range and approximated the value of the merger consideration at the upper end of the range.

 
Pro Forma Impact Analysis
 
Because the merger consideration consists solely of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock, RP Financial considered the estimated pro forma

impact of the merger on Old Line Bancshares’ financial condition, operating results and stock pricing ratios. Specifically, RP Financial considered
that the merger is anticipated to be approximately 3% dilutive to Old Line Bancshares’ tangible book value per share and will be accretive to Old
Line Bancshares’ pro forma earnings per share within the first year of completing the merger, assuming incorporation of certain anticipated merger
synergies and core earnings estimates for Bay Bancorp, and will increase Old Line Bancshares’ market capitalization and shares outstanding.
Furthermore, RP Financial considered the increased asset size, competitive profile and geographic footprint of Old Line Bancshares on a pro forma
basis. RP Financial considered the pro forma impact of the merger on Old Line Bancshares’ per share data and pricing ratios based on Old Line
Bancshares’ pre-announcement trading price. RP Financial also considered other benefits of the merger to Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, including the
potential for increased liquidity of the stock for Bay Bancorp’s stockholders given Old Line Bancshares’ larger size, greater market capitalization,
greater number of shares outstanding, and greater liquidity of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock on a post-acquisition basis. Moreover, RP
Financial considered the enhanced ability to pursue growth within the expanded market area and expanded management team. In comparing the pro
forma impact of the merger, RP Financial also took into consideration that following the merger, Bay Bancorp’s stockholders will own approximately
26% to 28% of the common stock in Old Line Bancshares, with the ownership level dependent upon the closing market prices of Old Line
Bancshares common stock prior to the effective date of the merger, and that three directors of Bay Bancorp will serve on the Old Line Bancshares’
board of directors following the closing of the merger.

 
In addition to the above analyses, RP Financial considered and evaluated the operating history of Bay Bancorp, the historical trading activity

and trading price of the Bay Bancorp common stock, and the national, regional and local risks that could negatively impact future operations on a
stand-alone basis. RP Financial’s opinion and presentation to the Bay Bancorp board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by
the Bay Bancorp board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. Although the foregoing summary describes the
material components of the analyses presented by RP Financial to the Bay Bancorp board of directors in anticipation of issuing the September 27,
2017 opinion, it does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by RP Financial and is qualified by reference to the
written opinion of RP Financial set forth as Annex C, which common stockholders of Bay Bancorp are urged to read in its entirety.

Opinion of Hovde Group - Bay Bancorp’s Financial Advisor
 

The fairness opinion and a summary of the underlying financial analyses of Hovde Group are described below. The description contains
projections, estimates and other forward-looking statements about the future earnings or other measures of the future performance of Bay Bancorp.
The projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain, including factors related to general economic
and competitive conditions. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the projections. You should not rely on any of
these statements as having been made or adopted by Bay Bancorp or Old Line Bancshares. You should review the copy of the fairness opinion, which
is attached as Annex D.

 
Hovde Group is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger and is

familiar with Bay Bancorp and its operations. As part of its investment banking business, Hovde Group is continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with, among other things, mergers and acquisitions. Hovde Group has experience in, and knowledge of,
banks, thrifts and their respective holding companies and is familiar with Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s board of directors selected Hovde Group to
act as its investment banking firm and financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of the firm’s reputation and expertise in
transactions such as the merger. During the past two years, the investment banking and financial advisory services rendered to Bay Bancorp by
Hovde Group have been limited to effecting two stock repurchase transactions in August 2016 for which Hovde Group received approximately
$14,369 in brokerage commissions from Bay Bancorp.

 
Hovde Group reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger with Bay Bancorp’s board of directors and, on September 27, 2017,

delivered a written opinion to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors that the per share consideration to be received by the stockholders of Bay Bancorp in
connection with the merger is fair to the stockholders of Bay Bancorp from a financial point of view. In requesting Hovde Group’s advice and
opinion, no limitations were imposed by Bay Bancorp upon Hovde Group with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in
rendering its opinion.

 
The full text of Hovde Group’s written opinion is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D. You are urged to

read the opinion in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken by Hovde Group. The summary of the Hovde Group’s opinion included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Hovde Group’s opinion was directed to Bay
Bancorp’s board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the per share consideration to be paid to Bay Bancorp stockholders in connection with
the merger. Hovde Group did not opine on any individual stock, cash, or other components of consideration payable in connection with the merger.
Hovde Group’s opinion does not address the underlying business decision to proceed with the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
any of the stockholders as to how such stockholder should vote at the Bay Bancorp special meeting on the merger or any related matter. Other than as
specifically set forth in the opinion, Hovde Group dos not express any opinion with respect to the terms and provisions of the merger agreement or
the enforceability of any such terms or provisions.

 
Bay Bancorp engaged Hovde Group on June 22, 2017 to serve as a financial advisor to Bay Bancorp in connection with the proposed

merger and to issue a fairness opinion to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors in connection with such proposed transaction. Pursuant to Bay Bancorp’s
engagement agreement with Hovde Group, Hovde Group will receive from Bay Bancorp a $100,000 fairness opinion fee that is contingent upon the
delivery to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors of Hovde Group’s fairness opinion. Additionally, Hovde Group will receive a completion fee equal to
1.0% of the transaction value that is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. For this purpose, the transaction value will include the
aggregate merger consideration plus the aggregate amount of cash paid in exchange for any Bay Bancorp stock option that remains unexercised as of
the effective time of the merger. The opinion fee will be credited in full toward the portion of the completion fee that will become payable to Hovde
Group upon the consummation of the merger. In the event that the merger agreement is terminated and Old Line Bancshares is obligated to pay the
$5,076,000 termination fee to Bay Bancorp, then Hovde Group will be entitled to $761,400, or 15% of that termination fee. In addition to Hovde
Group’s fees, and regardless of whether the merger is consummated, Bay Bancorp has agreed to reimburse Hovde Group for certain of its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. Bay Bancorp has also agreed to indemnify Hovde Group and its affiliates for certain liabilities that may arise out of the
engagement. In the past two years, Hovde Group has provided investment banking or financial advisory services to Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank.
During the past two years preceding the date of this opinion, Hovde Group has not provided any investment banking or financial advisory services to
Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank. Hovde Group may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Old Line
Bancshares or Old Line Bank and receive compensation for such services, although to Hovde Group’s knowledge none are expected at this time.

Since the Average Price, and the related amounts derived from those figures, cannot be determined until dates after the date of the opinion,

potential future adjustments to the exchange ratio attributable to changes in the Average Price as of the actual determination date, if any, cannot be
predicted with precision. However, Bay Bancorp advised Hovde Group to assume for purposes of its fairness opinion that the Average Price as of the
applicable determination date would be equal to or greater than $25.65. Further, the merger agreement provides for a possible increase, but not a
decrease, in the aggregate merger consideration as a result of after-tax income recognized from the future resolution of certain contingencies related
to litigation and certain loans that are characterized as Classified Assets as discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Hovde
Group’s opinion assumes that the merger consideration will not be increased pursuant to these provisions.

 
Bay Bancorp requested Hovde Group’s opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share consideration to the

stockholders of Bay Bancorp. This opinion addresses only the fairness of the per share consideration to be paid in connection with the merger, and
Hovde Group is not opining on any individual stock, cash, option, or other components of the consideration.

 
The following is a summary of the analyses performed and matters considered by Hovde Group in connection with its fairness opinion. The

summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Hovde Group in rendering its opinion, but it
does summarize all of the material analyses performed by Hovde Group.

 
During the course of its engagement and for the purpose of rendering its opinion, Hovde Group:
 

· reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated September 27, 2017, as provided to Hovde Group by Bay Bancorp;
 

· reviewed unaudited financial statements for Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line as of and for the six-
month period ending June 30, 2017;

 
· reviewed certain historical annual reports of each of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, including

audited annual reports as of and for the year ending December 31, 2016;
 

· reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning each of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old
Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank;

 
· reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank;

 
· reviewed financial projections prepared by certain members of senior management of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank;

 
· discussed with certain members of senior management of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, the

business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old
Line Bank; the history and past and current operations of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank; Bay
Bancorp’s, Bay Bank’s, Old Line Bancshares’ and Old Line Bank’s historical financial performance; and their assessment of the
rationale for the merger;

 
· reviewed and analyzed materials detailing the merger prepared by Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares and by their respective

legal and financial advisors, including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses, purchase
accounting adjustments and synergies expected to result from the merger (the “Potential Income Enhancements”);

 
· analyzed the pro forma financial impact of the merger on the combined company’s earnings, tangible book value, financial ratios

and other such metrics we deemed relevant, giving effect to the merger based on assumptions relating to the Potential Income
Enhancements;

 
· reviewed publicly available consensus mean analyst earnings per share estimates for Old Line Bancshares for the years ending

December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019;

9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 83/225

 

 
· assessed general economic, market and financial conditions;

 
· reviewed the terms of recent merger, acquisition and control investment transactions, to the extent publicly available, involving

financial institutions and financial institution holding companies that we considered relevant;
 

· taken into consideration our experience in other similar transactions and securities valuations as well as our knowledge of the
banking and financial services industry;

 
· reviewed historical market prices and trading volumes of Old Line Bancshares’ common stock;

 
· reviewed certain publicly available financial and stock market data relating to selected public companies that we deemed relevant

to our analysis; and
 

· performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
 

Hovde Group also took into account its experience in other similar transactions and securities valuations, as well as its knowledge of the
banking and financial services industry.

 
Hovde Group assumed, without investigation, that there have been and from the date of the opinion through the effective date of the merger

will be no material changes in the financial condition and results of operations of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank
since the date of the latest financial information described above. Hovde Group assumed, without independent verification, that the representations as
well as the financial and other information provided to Hovde Group by Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares or included in the merger agreement,
which has formed a substantial basis for this opinion, are true and complete. Hovde Group relied upon the management of Bay Bancorp and Old Line
Bancshares as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial forecasts and projections (and the assumptions and bases therein) provided to
Hovde Group by Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares, and Hovde Group assumed such forecasts and projections have been reasonably prepared
by Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares on a basis reflecting the best currently available information and Bay Bancorp’s and Old Line Bancshares’
judgments and estimates. Hovde Group assumed that such forecasts and projections would be realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated
thereby, and Hovde Group does not in any respect assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reasonableness thereof. Hovde Group has been
authorized by Bay Bancorp to rely upon such forecasts and projections and other information and data, including without limitation the projections,
and Hovde Group expresses no view as to any such forecasts, projections or other forward-looking information or data, or the bases or assumptions
on which they were prepared.

 
In performing its review, Hovde Group relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was

available to Hovde Group from public sources, that was provided to Hovde Group by Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares or their respective
representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by Hovde Group and assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion.
Hovde Group has further relied on the assurances of the respective managements of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares that they are not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Hovde Group has not been asked to and has not
undertaken an independent verification of any of such information, and Hovde Group does not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy
or completeness thereof. Hovde Group assumed that each party to the merger agreement would advise them promptly if any information previously
provided to them became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of Hovde Group’s review.

 
Hovde Group is not an expert in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for

losses with respect thereto. Hovde Group assumed that such allowances for Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank are, in
the aggregate, adequate to cover such losses, and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity. Hovde Group was not requested to
make, and did not make, an independent evaluation, physical inspection or appraisal of the assets, properties, facilities, or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Bay Bancorp. Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, the collateral securing any such assets or liabilities, or the
collectability of any such assets, and Hovde Group was not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals nor did Hovde Group review any loan
or credit files of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank. Hovde Group did not conduct a review of any credit mark that
may be taken in connection with the merger nor has it evaluated the adequacy of any contemplated credit mark to be so taken.

 
In arriving at its opinion, Hovde Group did not evaluate the solvency of Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank

under any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Accordingly, its opinion does not address the liquidation value of
Bay Bancorp, Bay Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank or any other entity. Hovde Group has also assumed that each of Bay Bancorp, Bay
Bank, Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank would remain as a going concern for all periods relevant to its analysis. Accordingly, Hovde Group
expresses no opinion with respect to the foregoing.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 84/225

 

 
Hovde Group’s opinion does not consider, include or address: (i) the legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory consequences of the merger on

Bay Bancorp, or its stockholders; (ii) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to the board of directors or Bay Bancorp; (iii) any other
strategic alternatives that might be available to Bay Bancorp; or (iv) whether Old Line Bancshares has sufficient cash or other sources of funds to
enable it to pay any consideration contemplated by the merger.

 
Hovde Group has assumed that the merger will be consummated substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger

agreement, without any waiver of material terms or conditions by Bay Bancorp or any other party to the Agreement and that the final merger
agreement will not differ materially from the draft Hovde Group reviewed. Hovde Group has assumed that the merger will be consummated in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Bay Bancorp has advised Hovde Group that Bay Bancorp is not aware of any factors that would
impede any necessary regulatory or governmental approval of the merger. Hovde Group has assumed that the necessary regulatory and governmental
approvals as granted will not be subject to any conditions that would be unduly burdensome on Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares or would have
a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger.

 
In performing its analyses, Hovde Group made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,

market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Hovde Group, Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares.
Hovde Group’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions and circumstances as they existed on, and on the
information made available to Hovde Group as of, the dates used in its opinion. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Hovde Group
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or
securities may be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Hovde Group’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
business combination in which Bay Bancorp might engage. In addition, Hovde Group’s fairness opinion was among several factors taken into
consideration by Bay Bancorp’s board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, the
analyses described below should not be viewed as solely determinative of the decision of Bay Bancorp’s board of directors or Bay Bancorp’s
management with respect to the fairness of the merger consideration to be received by Bay Bancorp’s stockholders in connection with the merger.

 
The following is a summary of the material analyses prepared by Hovde Group and delivered to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors on

September 27, 2017 in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion. This summary is not a complete description of the analyses underlying the
fairness opinion or the presentation prepared by Hovde Group, but it summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with
such opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not
readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Hovde Group did not attribute any particular weight to any
analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. The
financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The analyses and the summary of the analyses must be
considered as a whole and selecting portions of the analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses and opinion of Hovde Group. The
tables alone are not a complete description of the financial analyses.

Market Approach – Comparable Transactions. As part of its analysis, Hovde Group reviewed publicly available information related to two

comparable groups (a “Regional Group” and a “Nationwide Group”) of select acquisition transactions of banks. The Regional Group consisted of
acquisition transactions where sellers were headquartered in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington D.C.
and West Virginia announced since September 1, 2015, in which the sellers’ total assets were between $400 million and $1.1 billion, last-twelve-
months (“LTM”) return on average assets (“ROAA”) were between 0.40% and 1.00%, and non-performing assets (“NPAs”) to total assets were less
than 3.00%. The Nationwide Group consisted of acquisition transactions of banks in the United States announced since September 1, 2015, in which
the sellers’ total assets were between $500 million and $1.0 billion, LTM ROAA were between 0.40% and 1.00%, and NPAs to total assets were less
than 3.00%. In each case, for which financial information was available, no transaction that fit the above selection criteria was excluded. Information
for the target institutions was based on balance sheet data as of, and income statement data for the twelve months preceding the most recent quarter
prior to announcement of the transactions. The resulting two groups consisted of the following transactions (10 transactions for the Regional Group
and 17 transactions for the Nationwide Group):

For each precedent transaction, Hovde Group compared the implied ratio of deal value to certain financial characteristics of Bay Bancorp as

follows:
 

 
•  the multiple of the purchase consideration to the acquired company’s tangible common book value (the “Price-to-Tangible Common Book

Value Multiple”);
 

 
•  the multiple of the purchase consideration to the acquired company’s LTM net earnings per share (the “Price-to-LTM Earnings

Multiple”); and
 

 
•  the multiple of the difference between the purchase consideration and the acquired company’s tangible book value to the acquired

company’s core deposits (the “Premium-to-Core Deposits Multiple”).

The results of the analysis are set forth in the table below. Transaction multiples for the merger were derived from the total deal value of

$127,638,810. The total deal value is an aggregate of the estimated per share purchase price of $11.80, which implies a merger consideration of
$126,461,262, and the implied value of cash consideration to be paid to holders of Bay Bancorp’s options to purchase common stock of $1,177,548
based on June 30, 2017 financial results of Bay Bancorp.

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above transaction analyses is identical to Bay Bancorp, and no transaction was

consummated on terms identical to the terms of the merger agreement. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not strictly mathematical. Rather, it
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies. The resulting
values of the Precedent Transactions Regional Group indicated an implied aggregate valuation ranging between $67.0 million and $97.6 million
compared to the proposed merger consideration of $127.6 million. The resulting values of the Precedent Transactions Nationwide Group indicated an
implied aggregate valuation ranging between $74.4 million and $102.1 million compared to the proposed merger consideration of $127.6 million.

Income Approach – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Taking into account various factors including, but not limited to, Bay Bancorp’s recent

performance, the current banking environment and the local economy in which Bay Bancorp operates, Hovde Group determined, in consultation with
and based on information provided by management of Bay Bancorp, earnings estimates for Bay Bancorp over a forward looking six year period, and
in consultation with Bay Bancorp management, developed the forward-looking projections and key assumptions that formed the basis for the
discounted cash flow analyses. The resulting projected Bay Bancorp net income numbers used for the analysis were $5.0 million for 2017, $5.9
million for 2018, $7.0 million for 2019, $7.6 million for 2020, $8.4 million for 2021, and $9.3 million for 2022.

 
To determine present values of Bay Bancorp based on these projections, Hovde Group utilized two discounted cash flow models, each of

which capitalized terminal values using a different methodology: (i) Terminal Price/Earnings Multiple (“DCF Terminal P/E Multiple”); and (ii)
Terminal Price/Tangible Book Value Multiple (“DCF Terminal P/TBV Multiple”).

 
In the DCF Terminal P/E Multiple analysis, an estimated value of Bay Bancorp’s common stock was calculated based on the present value

of Bay Bancorp’s after-tax net income based on Bay Bancorp management’s forward-looking projections. Hovde Group utilized a terminal value at
the end of 2022 by applying a range of price-to-earnings multiples of 18.3x to 22.3x, with a midpoint of 20.3x, which is based around the median
price-to-earnings multiple derived from transactions in the Regional Group. The present value of Bay Bancorp’s projected dividends, if any, plus the
terminal value was then calculated assuming a range of discount rates between 12.25% and 14.25%, with a midpoint of 13.25% discounted over a
period of 5.26 years. This range of discount rates was centered around Bay Bancorp’s cost of equity based on the capital assets pricing model, which
estimates the required return of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders over a risk-free interest rate. The excess of that return includes an equity risk premium,
an industry risk premium and a size premium, each of which were sourced from Duff & Phelps’ 2017 valuation handbook. The resulting aggregate
values of Bay Bancorp’s common stock of the DCF Terminal P/E Multiple ranged between $90.0 million and $118.7 million, with a midpoint of
$103.8 million. The resulting per share values of Bay Bancorp’s common stock of the DCF Terminal P/E Multiple ranged between $8.34 and $11.01,
with a midpoint of $9.62.

 
In the DCF Terminal P/TBV Multiple model, the same earnings estimates and projected net income were used, however, in arriving at the

terminal value at the end of 2022, Hovde Group applied a range of price-to-tangible book value multiples of 1.22x to 1.42x with the midpoint being
1.32x, which is based around the median price-to-tangible book value multiple derived from transactions in the Regional Group. The present value of
projected dividends, if any, plus the terminal value, was then calculated assuming a range of discount rates between 12.25% and 14.25%, with a
midpoint of 13.25% discounted over a period of 5.26 years. The resulting aggregate values of Bay Bancorp’s common stock of the DCF Terminal
P/TBV Multiple ranged between $67.0 million and $84.2 million, with a midpoint of $75.2 million. The resulting per share values of Bay Bancorp’s
common stock of the DCF Terminal P/TBV Multiple ranged between $6.19 and $7.80, with a midpoint of $6.96.

 
These analyses and their underlying assumptions yielded a range of values for Bay Bancorp, which are outlined in the table below:

Hovde Group noted that while the discounted cash flow present value analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, it relies on

numerous assumptions, including asset and earnings growth rates, projected dividend payouts, terminal values and discount rates. Hovde Group’s
analysis does not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Bay Bancorp’s common stock.

 
Old Line Bancshares Comparable Companies Analysis:  Hovde Group used publicly available information to compare selected financial

and trading information for Old Line Bancshares and a group of 10 publicly-traded financial institutions selected by Hovde Group based on publicly-
traded banks headquartered in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington D.C. and West Virginia with total assets between $1.3
billion and $3.0 billion and LTM ROAA between 0.80% and 1.20%.

The analysis compared publicly available financial and market trading information for Old Line Bancshares and the data for the 10 financial

institutions identified above as of and for the most recent twelve-month period which was publicly available. The table below compares the data for
Old Line Bancshares and the median data for the 10 financial institutions identified above, with pricing data as of September 26, 2017.

Old Line Bancshares fell within the range of pricing metrics of comparable companies. No company used as a comparison in the above
analyses is identical to Old Line Bancshares. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not strictly mathematical. Rather, it involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies.

 
Accretion / Dilution Analysis:  Hovde Group performed pro forma merger analyses that combined projected income statement and balance

sheet information of Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares. Assumptions regarding the accounting treatment, acquisition adjustments and cost
savings were used to calculate the financial impact that the merger would have on certain projected financial results of Old Line Bancshares. In the
course of this analysis, Hovde Group used the S&P Cap IQ mean of analyst earnings estimates for Old Line Bancshares for the years ending
December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, and an earnings growth rate of 8.0% was assumed for December 31, 2020.
Additionally, Hovde Group used earnings estimates provided by Bay Bancorp’s management for Bay Bancorp for the years ending December 31,
2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, and an earnings growth rate of 10.0% was assumed for December 31, 2020. This analysis indicated
that the merger is expected to be accretive by $0.11 per share to Old Line Bancshares’ consensus estimated earnings per share of $1.97 in 2018,
accretive by $0.20 per share to Old Line Bancshares’ consensus estimated earnings per share of $2.19 in 2019, and accretive by $0.20 per share to
Old Line Bancshares’ consensus estimated earnings per share of $2.37 in 2020. The analysis also indicated that the merger is expected to be dilutive
to tangible book value per share for Old Line Bancshares by $0.14 per share in 2018, accretive by $0.06 per share in 2019, and accretive by $0.26 per
share in 2020 and that Old Line Bancshares would maintain capital ratios in excess of those required for Old Line Bancshares to be considered well-
capitalized under existing regulations. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares prior to
and following the merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Other Factors and Analyses.  Hovde Group took into consideration various other factors and analyses, including but not limited to: current

market environment; merger and acquisition environment; movements in the common stock valuations of selected publicly-traded banking
companies; and movements in the S&P 500 Index.

 
Conclusion.  Based upon the foregoing analyses and other investigations and assumptions set forth in its opinion, without giving specific

weightings to any one factor or comparison, Hovde Group determined that the per share consideration to be paid by Old Line Bancshares to the
stockholders of Bay Bancorp in connection with the merger is fair from a financial point of view to Bay Bancorp’s stockholders.  Each Bay Bancorp
stockholder is encouraged to read Hovde Group’s fairness opinion in its entirety. The full text of this fairness opinion is included as Annex D
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Terms of the Merger
 

Effects of the Merger
 
Upon completion of the merger, Bay Bancorp will be merged with and into Old Line Bancshares and the separate legal existence of Bay

Bancorp will cease. All property, rights, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities of Bay Bancorp will automatically be deemed transferred to Old
Line Bancshares, as the surviving corporation in the merger. Old Line Bancshares will continue to be governed by its articles of incorporation and
bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the merger.

 
The merger agreement provides that, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between Old Line Bank and Bay Bank, dated as

of September 27, 2017, immediately after the merger Bay Bank will be merged with and into Old Line Bank, with Old Line Bank as the surviving
bank in the bank merger. Old Line Bank will continue to be governed by its articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect immediately prior to the
bank merger.

 
Consideration to be Paid in the Merger; What Bay Bancorp Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger
 
If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of common stock of Bay Bancorp will be converted into the right to receive shares of Old

Line Bancshares common stock. The number of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock for which shares of Bay Bancorp common stock will
be exchanged in the merger, which we refer to as the “per share consideration,” will be calculated by dividing $11.80 by the volume-weighted
average closing prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock for the 20 trading days ending five trading days before the closing date of the merger,
subject to a minimum Average Price of $25.65 and a maximum average price of $29.16 and adjustments for the after-tax income recognized by Bay
Bancorp or Bay Bank from the recent settlement of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans. As such, the per share consideration, before
adjustments, may be as low as 0.4047 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock if the Average Price is $29.16 or more and as high as 0.4600
shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock if the Average Price is $25.65 or less, before the litigation and loan resolution adjustments provided for
in the merger agreement.

 
Initial Calculation
 

Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of Bay Bancorp common stock that you hold at the effective time of the merger will be
automatically converted into the right to receive shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock. The number of shares of Old Line Bancshares
common stock for which shares of Bay Bancorp common stock will be exchanged in the merger, which we refer to as the “per share consideration,”
will vary depending on the volume-weighted average closing prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock for the 20 trading days prior to the five
trading days prior to the closing date of the merger, which we refer to as the “Average Price.” Such calculation will be made as follows:

 
i. If the Average Price is between $25.66 and $29.15, then the per share consideration will be equal the number of shares of Old Line

Bancshares common stock determined by dividing $11.80 by the Average Price;
 

ii. If the Average Price is $29.16 or above, then the per share consideration will equal 0.4047 shares of Old Line Bancshares common
stock; and

 
iii. If the Average Price is $25.65 or below, then the per share consideration will equal 0.4600 shares of Old Line Bancshares common

stock (such number, in any of (i), (ii) or (iii), is also referred to as the “exchange ratio”).
 

 82  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 91/225

 

 
Accordingly, based on the number of shares of Bay Bancorp common stock currently outstanding and recent trading prices of Old Line

Bancshares common stock, before any adjustments to the exchange ratio (as discussed immediately below), and absent the exercise of the Walk-
Away Cure Right, as discussed below under “– Bay Bancorp Price Termination Right,” we expect the value of the shares of Old Line Bancshares
common stock to be issued in the merger would be approximately $132.6 million and that Old Line Bancshares would issue between approximately
4,337,529 and 4,930,228 shares of its common stock in the merger. We refer to the total number of shares Old Line Bancshares will issue in the
merger as the merger consideration or the aggregate merger consideration.

 
As set forth in the table above, changes in the Average Price below $25.65 or above $29.16 will not, absent the exercise of the Walk-Away

Cure Right, impact the number of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that will be issued in exchange for a share of Bay Bancorp common
stock in the merger (i.e. the per share consideration), since at such point the exchange ratio will be fixed. Once the exchange ratio is fixed, the value
of the merger consideration will be dependent upon the value of Old Line Bancshares common stock and, therefore, will fluctuate with the market
price of Old Line Bancshares common stock. Therefore, to the extent the Average Price falls below $25.65, the value of the aggregate merger
consideration, prior to the adjustments described below, will be below $127.6 million, and to the extent the Average Price increases above $29.16, the
value of the aggregate merger consideration will be above $127.6 million.

 
Adjustments
 

As previously discussed, the aggregate merger consideration and the exchange ratio are subject to adjustment as a result of the favorable
resolution of certain pending litigation and outstanding loans as follows:

 
· Litigation Adjustment: With respect to any after-tax income recognized by Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank on or after August 4, 2017 and prior

to the effective time of the merger from the settlement of the lawsuit captioned Lois F. Lapidus, et al. v. Bay Bank, FSB, No. RDB 16-
03260 (the “Lawsuit”), in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland, (i) the value of the merger consideration will be increased by such after-tax income and (ii) the exchange ratio will be
increased by an amount determined by (a) dividing such after-tax income by the number of shares of Bay Bancorp common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, and (b) dividing that amount by the Average Price.

 
On September 26, 2017, Bay Bank received insurance proceeds in the amount of $1,425,000 in connection with its settlement of the
Lawsuit. Bay Bank expects to recognize $984,750 in after-tax income related to such settlement prior to the effective date of the merger
and, as a result, we expect the merger consideration and the exchange ratio to increase. Assuming this amount is correct, and assuming
that there are 10,717,889 shares of Bay Bancorp common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which
is the number of shares of Bay Bancorp common stock outstanding on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and that the
Average Price is $30.2883 (which is the volume-weighted average closing prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock for the 20 trading
days ending five trading days before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), such that (i) the exchange ratio, prior to any
adjustment, is 0.4047 and (ii) the merger consideration, prior to any adjustment, is 4,337,529 shares of Old Line Bancshares common
stock, with an aggregate value of $132,634,748.41, then (y) the value of the merger consideration, as adjusted for resolution of the
Lawsuit, would be increased to $133,619,498.41 and (z) the exchange ratio, as adjusted for resolution of the Lawsuit, would be increased
by 0.0030 to 0.4077.
 

· Loan Resolution Adjustment: With respect to any after-tax income recognized by Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank on or after August 4, 2017
and prior to the effective time of the merger as of a result of resolution of one or more certain problem loans held in Bay Bank’s loan
portfolio to the extent that the amount recovered on any such loan exceeds its carrying amount at May 31, 2017 (in aggregate, the “Net
Loan Recovery Amount”), (i) the value of the merger consideration will be increased by the Net Loan Recovery Amount and (ii) the
exchange ratio will be increased by an amount determined by (a) dividing the Net Loan Recovery Amount by the number of shares of
Bay Bancorp common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, and (b) dividing that amount by the
Average Price, provided, however, that if the Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank net loan and lease charge-offs between August 4, 2017 and the
effective date of the merger exceeds $226,000, the Net Loan Recovery Amount will be reduced by such excess, and provided further that
such reduction will not exceed $500,000.

9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 92/225

 

 
Based on the resolution and anticipated resolution of such problem loans and net loan and lease charge-offs between August 4, 2017 and
January 23, 2018, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Bay Bancorp estimates that as of
such date the adjusted Net Loan Recovery Amount would be $605,613. Assuming this amount is correct, and that there are no additional
loan resolutions or net loan and lease charge-offs through the effective date of the merger, and assuming further that there are 10,717,889
shares of Bay Bancorp common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and the Average Price is
$30.2883, such that (i) the exchange ratio, prior to any adjustment, is 0.4047 and (ii) the merger consideration, prior to any adjustment, is
4,337,529 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock, with an aggregate value of $132,634,748.41, then (y) the value of the merger
consideration, as adjusted for resolution of the loans, would be increased to $133,240,361.41 and (z) the exchange ratio, as adjusted for
resolution of the loans, would be increased by 0.0018 to 0.4065.
 

Combined Example: Assume that all of the facts and circumstances set above were to occur. In such case, (i) the value of the merger
consideration, as adjusted for resolutions of the Lawsuit and the loans, would be increased to $134,225,111.41 and (ii) the exchange ratio, as adjusted
for resolutions of the Lawsuit and the loans, would be increased by 0.0048 to 0.4095.

 
In addition, the number of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that will be exchanged for each outstanding share of Bay Bancorp

common stock may be increased if Old Line Bancshares exercises its option to increase the merger consideration to avoid termination of the merger
agreement based on recent closing prices of Old Line Bancshares common stock prior to the merger, as further described below under “–
Termination”

 
The exchange ratio is also subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and

similar transactions involving Old Line Bancshares common stock.
 

General
 
Old Line Bancshares will not issue fractional shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock to Bay Bancorp stockholders. If you are

otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of Old Line Bancshares common stock under the exchange provisions described above, you will
instead receive cash for the fractional share of Old Line Bancshares common stock you would otherwise be entitled to in an amount that is equal to
the product of (i) the fraction of a share that would otherwise be due to you and (ii) the Average Price.

 
To illustrate the calculation of the per-share merger consideration, for example, assuming the Average Price was $30.2883 and the exchange

ratio was 0.4095, as set forth in the illustrations above, a Bay Bancorp stockholder who owned 100 shares of Bay Bancorp common stock
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger would have the right to receive in the merger 40 shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock
(which would have a value of $1,278.40 based on the closing sales price for Old Line Bancshares common stock of $31.96 on February 1, 2018) and
$28.78 of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Old Line Bancshares common stock.

 
Examples of the potential effects of fluctuations in the Average Price on the merger consideration (both with and without the assumed

adjustment resolution of the Lawsuit and certain loans) are illustrated in the following table, based upon a range of hypothetical Average Prices. The
Average Prices set forth in the following table have been included for illustrative purposes only. The Average Price may be less than $22.95 or more
than $31.05. We cannot assure you as to what the Average Price will be or what the value of the Old Line Bancshares common stock to be issued in
the merger will be at the effective time of the merger, and the Average Price at the effective time could be different than at the time of the Old Line
Bancshares or Bay Bancorp special meeting.

(1) 1st trigger for walk right - Average Price declines below $24.30.
(2) 2nd trigger is illustrative - actual trigger price is determined by a 15% difference in performance between Old Line Bancshares common stock and the NASDAQ Bank Index,

(3) Additional per share purchase price assumes an after-tax gain of $1,590,363 from Lawsuit and loan recovery.

 
Options
 

Options to purchase shares of Bay Bancorp common stock that are outstanding at the effective time of the merger will be converted into the
right to receive cash in the amount determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Bay Bancorp common stock issuable upon the exercise of
such option by (ii) the difference between (a) the Average Price multiplied by the per share consideration and (b) the exercise price per share of Bay
Bancorp common stock issuable upon the exercise of such option. Based on outstanding options to purchase 181,544 shares of Bay Bancorp common
stock as of February 1, 2018, the latest practicable date before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and assuming an Average Price of
$30.2883, we expect that Old Line Bancshares would pay approximately $1.31 million in exchange for the outstanding options to purchase shares of
Bay Bancorp common stock in connection with the merger, assuming no options are exercised between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the effective date of the merger.

Bay Bancorp Price Termination Right
 
Bay Bancorp has the option, but is not required, to terminate the merger agreement if, at any time during the five trading days before the

effective date of the merger, the volume-weighted average closing price of Old Line Bancshares common stock during the 20 prior trading days is
less than 90% of $27.00, and the decrease in such price is more than 15% lower than the change in the average of Nasdaq Bank Index prices for the
20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the determination date (the “Final Index Price”) relative to the Nasdaq Bank Index
closing price as September 27, 2017. Old Line Bancshares, however, would then have the option to increase the per share consideration (by
increasing the exchange ratio, making a cash payment or a combination of both) so that the per share consideration is an amount that equals the lesser
of (i) the product of $27.00, 90% and the exchange ratio (which at that point would be 0.4600, excluding any adjustments) or (ii) (a) the Final Index
Price divided by the Nasdaq Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, multiplied by (b) 85% and the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-
weighted average price, divided by (c) the quotient of the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-weighted average price divided by $27.00, in which
case no termination will take place (the “Walk-Away Cure Right”).

 
The merger agreement does not provide for a resolicitation of Old Line Bancshares’ or Bay Bancorp’s stockholders in the event that (i) the

conditions above are met and Bay Bancorp chooses to complete the merger, (ii) the conditions above are met and Bay Bancorp determines to
terminate the merger agreement, or (iii) the conditions above are met and Bay Bancorp determines to terminate the merger agreement and Old Line
Bancshares determines to exercise the Walk-Away Cure Right. Bay Bancorp’s board of directors has made no decision as to whether it would
exercise Bay Bancorp’s right to terminate the merger under these circumstances, and Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors has made no decision
as to whether, if Bay Bancorp exercised its right to terminate the merger agreement under the circumstances described, it would exercise the Walk-
Away Cure Right. In considering whether to exercise Bay Bancorp’s right to terminate the merger agreement or Old Line Bancshares’ right to
exercise the Walk-Away Cure Right, the applicable company’s board of directors would take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances
that exist at the time and would consult with its financial advisors and legal counsel.

 
Each of the fairness opinion received by Old Line Bancshares from FIG and the fairness opinions received by Bay Bancorp from RP

Financial and Hovde Group is dated as of September 27, 2017, and is based on conditions in effect on that date. Accordingly, the fairness opinions do
not address the possibilities presented if the termination provision discussed above is triggered, including the possibility that Bay Bancorp’s board of
directors might elect to continue with the merger even if Bay Bancorp has the ability to terminate the merger agreement under that provision or that
Old Line Bancshares may elect to exercise the Walk-Away Cure Right if Bay Bancorp elects to terminate the merger agreement as discussed herein.
See “– Opinion of Old Line Bancshares’ Financial Advisor” and “– Opinion of Bay Bancorp’s Financial Advisor.”

 
Approval of the merger by Bay Bancorp’s stockholders will confer on Bay Bancorp’s board of directors the power to complete the merger

even if the price-related termination provision is triggered, without any further action by or re-solicitation of the votes of Bay Bancorp’s
stockholders. In addition, approval of the merger by Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders will confer on Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors the
power to exercise the Walk-Away Cure Right should Bay Bancorp elect to terminate the merger agreement under the circumstances discussed herein,
without any further action by or re-solicitation of the votes of Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders.

 
Exchange Procedures
 
If you are a record holder of Bay Bancorp common stock and hold your shares in certificated form, a letter of transmittal for use in

surrendering your certificates representing your shares of Bay Bancorp common stock will be mailed to you no more than five business days
following the effective date of the merger. The letter of transmittal will include instructions for submitting your Bay Bancorp stock certificate(s) in
exchange for the Old Line Bancshares common stock you are entitled to receive as a result of the merger. You must carefully follow the instructions
on the letter of transmittal and return a properly executed letter of transmittal and your Bay Bancorp stock certificate(s), to the exchange agent in
order to receive the per share consideration for your shares. The Bay Bancorp stock certificate(s) must be in a form that is acceptable for transfer (as
explained in the letter of transmittal).

 
Neither Old Line Bancshares nor its exchange agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of any defects in a letter of

transmittal.

If you are a record holder of Bay Bancorp common stock and hold your shares in book-entry form (that is, your shares are not represented

by certificates but are represented by an entry in the stock transfer books of Bay Bancorp), you do not need to send in a letter of transmittal or any
other documentation in order to receive the per share consideration for your shares. Your shares of Bay Bancorp common stock will be automatically
converted into the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock you are entitled to receive as a result of the merger, and the exchange agent will
mail you a check representing the cash you are entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional share of Old Line Bancshares common stock you would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the merger.

 
Old Line Bancshares’ exchange agent will issue to each former stockholder of Bay Bancorp shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock,

in book-entry form (unless otherwise agreed to by Old Line Bancshares), and mail checks representing cash in lieu of fractional share interests, as
soon as practicable after the merger and, with respect to former Bay Bancorp stockholders who held their shares in certificated form, after its receipt
of a properly completed and signed letter of transmittal and all accompanying Bay Bancorp stock certificates representing shares of Bay Bancorp
common stock held by such former stockholder. No interest will be paid on any cash payment.

 
Shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock that are exchanged for shares of Bay Bancorp common stock in the merger will be considered

issued as of the effective date of the merger and will entitle the holders to dividends, distributions and all other rights and privileges of an Old Line
Bancshares stockholder from the effective date. Until the certificates representing Bay Bancorp common stock are surrendered for exchange,
however, holders of such certificates will not receive the merger consideration or dividends or distributions on the Old Line Bancshares common
stock into which such shares have been converted. When the certificates are surrendered to the exchange agent, any unpaid dividends or other
distributions will be paid without interest. Old Line Bancshares has the right to withhold dividends or any other distributions on its shares until the
applicable Bay Bancorp stock certificates are surrendered for exchange.

 
Until surrendered, each Bay Bancorp stock certificate, following the effective date of the merger, is evidence solely of the right to receive

the proportionate amount of the aggregate per share consideration. In no event will either Old Line Bancshares or its exchange agent be liable to any
former Bay Bancorp stockholder for any amount paid in good faith to a public official or agency pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

 
As discussed above, Old Line Bancshares will not issue any fractions of a share of common stock. Rather, Old Line Bancshares will pay

cash for any fractional share interest any Bay Bancorp stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive in the merger. For each fractional share that
would otherwise be issued, Old Line Bancshares will pay by check an amount equal to the amount of such fractional share multiplied by the Average
Price.

 
Old Line Bancshares Common Stock
 
Each share of Old Line Bancshares common stock outstanding immediately prior to completion of the merger will remain outstanding after

and be unchanged by the merger.
 
Effective Date
 
The merger will take effect when all conditions, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approval, have been fulfilled or waived, or

as soon as practicable thereafter as Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may mutually select. By law, however, regulatory and stockholder
approvals cannot be waived. We presently expect to close the merger on or about April 18, 2018. See “– Conditions to the Merger” and “–
Regulatory Approvals.”

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger
 
In the merger agreement, Bay Bancorp agreed to conduct its business and to engage in transactions only in the ordinary course of business,

consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by or contemplated in the merger agreement or consented to by Old Line Bancshares. Bay
Bancorp also agreed to use its commercially reasonable good faith efforts to preserve its business organization intact, to maintain good relationships
with employees, and to preserve the good will of its customers and others with whom business relationships exist. Further, in the merger agreement
Bay Bancorp agreed that, except as permitted by the merger agreement or required in writing by its regulators (with a copy of such written document
to Old Line Bancshares), through the effective time of the merger it will not, and will not allow any subsidiary to, without the written consent of Old
Line Bancshares:

 
· Change its articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter documents, operating agreement and/or other governing documents;

 
· Change the number of authorized or issued shares of its capital stock, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital

stock, or issue or grant options or similar rights with respect to its capital stock or any securities convertible into its capital stock;
 

· Declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution in respect of its capital stock;
 

· Grant any severance, retention or termination pay, except as disclosed or in accordance with policies or agreements with employees, other
than executive officers, in effect on September 27, 2017;

 
· Enter into or amend any employment, consulting, severance, compensation, “change-in-control” or termination contract or arrangement;

 
· Grant job promotions or increase the rate of compensation of or, except as disclosed to Old Line Bancshares, pay any bonus to, any

director, officer, employee, independent contractor, agent or other person associated with it, except with respect to officers and employees
at the level of Vice President or below (i) to the extent such promotion or increase is made in the ordinary course of its business consistent
with past practices, or (ii) routine periodic pay increases, selective merit pay increases and pay raises in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practices, provided, however, that such aggregate increases in the rate of compensation and benefits may not be
in excess of 3% and such aggregate bonuses may not be in excess of 5% of the aggregate salaries of all such employees;

 
· Hire any new employees or fill any job vacancies, except for employees at the level of Vice President or below that Bay Bancorp in good

faith determines is necessary to preserve its business, maintain relationships and preserve good will as set forth above;

· All necessary consents and approvals for the merger shall have been received, all necessary filings and registrations by Bay Bancorp and

Old Line Bancshares shall have been accepted or declared effective, except where the failure to obtain such consent or approval or for any
such filing or registration to be accepted or declared effective would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Old
Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank after the merger; all waiting periods relating to any necessary consents, approvals, filings and
registration statements shall have expired; and no such consent or approval shall have imposed any condition or requirement that in the
reasonable opinion of either Bay Bancorp’s board of directors or Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors would: (i) (a) prohibit or
materially limit the ownership or operation by Old Line Bancshares or any of its subsidiaries of all or any material portion of the business
or assets of Bay Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries, (b) compel Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp to dispose of all or a material potion
of either party’s business or assets, (c) impose a material compliance burden, penalty or obligation on Old Line Bancshares or Bay
Bancorp, or (d) otherwise materially impair the value of Bay Bancorp to Old Line Bancshares (any such requirement alone, or more than
one such requirement together, a “Burdensome Condition”); or (ii) so materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits
of the merger to either Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp, as applicable, such as to render it inadvisable. See “– Terms of the Merger –
Regulatory Approvals”;

 
· No court or regulatory authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any administrative decision or award,

decree, injunction, judgment, order, consent decree, quasi-judicial decision or award, ruling or writ or taken any other action that enjoins,
prohibits, restricts or makes illegal the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement that remains in effect;

 
· No Law shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced that restricts or makes illegal the completion of the transactions

contemplated by the merger agreement;
 

· Receipt of an opinion of its counsel that the merger constitutes for federal income tax purposes a tax-free “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and, with respect to the opinion received by Bay Bancorp, that any gain realized
in the merger will be recognized only to the extent of cash or other property (other than Old Line Bancshares common stock) received in
the merger, including cash received in lieu of fractional share interests. See “– Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences”;

 
· No material adverse change shall have occurred in the business, property, assets, liabilities, operations, business prospects, liquidity,

income or financial condition of the other party or any of its subsidiaries;
 

· The accuracy, as of September 27, 2017 and as of the closing date of the merger, of the representations and warranties of the other, except
as to any representation or warranty that specifically relates to an earlier date and except as otherwise contemplated by the merger
agreement;

 
· The other party’s performance in all material respects of all obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to the closing date of the

merger; and
 

· Other conditions that are customary for transactions of the type contemplated by the merger agreement.
 

In addition, Old Line Bancshares’ obligation to close the merger is also contingent on:
 
· Old Line Bancshares being satisfied that the recognized environmental conditions of any environmental assessments it conducted with

respect to Bay Bancorp’s or its subsidiaries’ assets, operations and secured interests, including real property, will not have a material
adverse effect on Bay Bancorp;

 
· Holders of no more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock as of the record date for the Bay Bancorp special

meeting qualifying their shares for appraisal rights; and
 

 94  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 103/225

 

 
· Old Line Bancshares having received all consents and authorizations of landlords and other persons that are necessary to permit the

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated without the violation of any lease or other material agreement to
which Bay Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties are bound, except where failure to obtain such
consent or authorization would be reasonably expected not to have a material adverse effect on Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank
after the merger.

 
Each party may waive each of the conditions described above in the manner and to the extent described in “– Amendment; Waiver”

immediately below.
 
Amendment; Waiver
 
Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior to the closing of the merger, Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp may:
 
· Amend the merger agreement;

 
· Extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts required in the merger agreement;

 
· Waive any term or condition of the merger agreement, any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties contained in the merger

agreement or in any document delivered pursuant thereto; or
 

· Waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement.
 

By Law, however, regulatory and stockholder approvals, and the requirement that no Law preventing the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement has been enacted or issued, cannot be waived.

 
Termination
 
The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective date of the merger by the mutual consent of Old Line Bancshares

and Bay Bancorp.
 
The merger agreement may also be terminated by either party if:
 
· The merger is not completed prior to April 30, 2018 or, because of the failure to obtain any required regulatory approval or consent by

such date, the merger is not completed prior to June 30, 2018, if the failure to complete the merger by that date is not due to a material
breach of the merger agreement by the party seeking to terminate it.

 
· There has been a definitive written denial of a required regulatory approval or consent, or the permanent withdrawal of an application for

approval or consent at the request of a regulatory authority.
 

· A required regulatory approval or consent is obtained but contains or would result in the imposition of a Burdensome Condition and
there is no meaningful possibility that such consent or approval could be revised prior to June 30, 2018 so as not to contain or result in a
Burdensome Condition.

 
· The other party has materially breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in the merger agreement, and such

breach either by its nature cannot be cured prior to the closing of the merger or remains uncured 30 days after receipt by such party of
written notice of such breach (provided that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period but may reasonably be
cured within 60 days and cure is being diligently pursued, then termination can occur only after expiration of such 60-day period), if the
party terminating the merger agreement is not in material breach.

 
· The other party’s board of directors withdraws, changes or modifies its recommendation to stockholders in a manner adverse to the

terminating party with respect to the merger agreement or the merger.
 

· Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders or Bay Bancorp’s stockholders vote on but fail to approve the merger.
 

 95  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 104/225

 

 
· Any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement has become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and remove such Law.

 
In addition, Bay Bancorp may terminate the merger agreement if:
 
· Bay Bancorp or any Bay Bancorp subsidiary receives, at any time prior to the Bay Bancorp special meeting, an acquisition proposal

from a third party, Bay Bancorp’s board of directors determines that such acquisition proposal the transaction pursuant to such proposal
is more favorable to the stockholders of Bay Bancorp than the merger, which we refer to a superior Bay Bancorp transaction, and Bay
Bancorp complies with certain conditions applicable to such termination right (see “Terms of the Merger – No Solicitation of Other
Transactions” on page 97).

 
· Old Line Bancshares or any Old Line Bancshares subsidiary enters into a definitive term sheet, letter of intent, agreement or similar

agreement to merge, as a result of which Old Line Bancshares is not the surviving entity or Old Line Bancshares’ directors as of
September 27, 2017 do not comprise the majority of the surviving entity’s board of directors, with any person other than Bay Bancorp,
and the Bay Bancorp board of directors determines, after considering the advice of counsel and its financial advisors, that such
transaction is not in the best interests of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders.

 
· If at any time during the five trading days before the effective date of the merger, the volume-weighted average closing price of Old Line

Bancshares common stock during the 20 prior trading days is less than 90% of $27.00, and the decrease in such price is more than 15%
lower than the change in the average of Nasdaq Bank Index prices for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to
the determination date (the “Final Index Price”) relative to the Nasdaq Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, provided,
however, that Old Line Bancshares would then have the option to increase the per share consideration (by increasing the exchange ratio,
making a cash payment or a combination of both) so that the value of the per share consideration is an amount that equals the lesser of
(i) the product of $27.00, 90% and the exchange ratio (which at that point would be 0.4600) or (ii) (a) the Final Index Price divided by
the Nasdaq Bank Index closing price as of September 27, 2017, multiplied by (b) 85%, the exchange ratio (which at that point would be
0.4600) and the Old Line Bancshares 20 day volume-weighted average price, divided by (c) the quotient of the Old Line Bancshares 20
day volume-weighted average price divided by $27.00, in which case no termination will take place.

 
Finally, Old Line Bancshares may terminate the merger agreement if:
 
· Bay Bancorp or any subsidiary of Bay Bancorp enters into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar instrument

with respect to any superior proposal or approves or resolves to approve any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar
instrument with respect to a superior Bay Bancorp transaction.

 
· Bay Bancorp’s board of directors authorizes, recommends or publicly proposes, or publicly announces an intention to authorize,

recommend or propose an agreement to enter into a superior Bay Bancorp transaction.
 

Old Line Bancshares Termination Fee
 
Old Line Bancshares must pay Bay Bancorp a termination fee in the amount of $5,076,000 if the merger agreement is terminated because:
 
· Old Line Bancshares has materially breached the merger agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement

contained therein (provided that Bay Bancorp is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in the merger agreement);

 
· The merger failed to close prior to April 30, 2018 or, if due solely to the need to obtain a regulatory approval or consent, June 30, 2018,

or the parties failed to receive all regulatory approvals and consents required for the merger, and such failure resulted from the knowing,
willful and intentional actions or inactions of Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank (provided that Bay Bancorp is not then in material
breach of any material representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement); or

 

 96

· The board of directors of Old Line Bancshares has withdrawn, changed or modified its recommendation to the stockholders of Old Line

Bancshares in a manner adverse to Bay Bancorp (provided that Bay Bancorp is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement).

 
Bay Bancorp Termination Fee
 
Bay Bancorp must pay Old Line Bancshares a termination fee in the amount of $5,076,000 if the merger agreement is terminated because:
 
· Bay Bancorp has materially breached the merger agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained

therein (provided that Old Line Bancshares is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in the merger agreement);

 
· The merger failed to close prior to April 30, 2018 or, if due solely to the need to obtain a regulatory approval or consent, June 30, 2018,

or the parties failed to receive all regulatory approvals and consents required for the merger, and such failure resulted from the knowing,
willful and intentional actions or inactions of Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank (provided that Old Line Bancshares is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement);

 
· Bay Bancorp or any Bay Bancorp subsidiary has received an acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior Bay Bancorp transaction; or

 
· The board of directors of Bay Bancorp has withdrawn, changed or modified its recommendation to the stockholders of Bay Bancorp in a

manner adverse to Old Line Bancshares or authorizes, recommends or publicly proposes, or publicly announces an intention to
authorize, recommend or propose, an agreement to enter into a superior Bay Bancorp transaction (provided that Old Line Bancshares is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement).

 
No Solicitation of Other Transactions
 
In the merger agreement, Bay Bancorp agreed that it will not, and will not allow its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,

financial advisors, attorneys or other representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly:
 
· Initiate, solicit, induce, encourage (including by way of furnishing information or providing assistance) or take any other action to

facilitate the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes, relates to or could reasonably be expected to lead to (i) a merger or
consolidation of, a share exchange involving, or an acquisition of 50% or more of the assets or liabilities of, Bay Bancorp or any of its
subsidiaries, or any other business combination involving Bay Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) a transaction that involves the
transfer of beneficial ownership of, the right to acquire beneficial ownership of or to vote securities representing, 10% or more of the
then outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp common stock or the outstanding equity securities any of its subsidiaries, each of which we
refer to as an acquisition proposal”;

 
· Respond to any inquiry relating to an acquisition proposal or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any acquisition

respect to Bay Bancorp or any subsidiary or otherwise relating to an acquisition proposal;

Bay Bancorp may, however, respond to an inquiry, furnish nonpublic information regarding Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries to, or enter

into discussions with, any person in response to an unsolicited acquisition proposal if (i) Bay Bancorp’s board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisers Hovde Group and RP Financial, that
such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an acquisition proposal that is more favorable to the stockholders of Bay
Bancorp than the merger (provided that such transaction is not conditioned on obtaining financing and would result in the acquisition of all, but not
less than all, of the outstanding shares of Bay Bancorp’s common stock or all or substantially all of the assets of Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis), which we refer to as a superior proposal, (ii) Bay Bancorp’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
and based upon the advice of its outside legal counsel and Hovde Group and RP Financial, that such action is required in order for the board of
directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, and (iii) at least two business days prior to furnishing any nonpublic
information to, or entering into discussions with, such person or entity, Bay Bancorp provides Old Line Bancshares with written notice of the identity
of such person or entity and of Bay Bancorp’s intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or entity and
Bay Bancorp receives from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such person or entity than the
confidentiality agreement between Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person or entity
with any exclusive right to negotiate with Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp has also agreed to promptly provide to Old Line Bancshares any non-public
information regarding Bay Bancorp or any subsidiary provided to any other person or entity that was not previously provided to Old Line
Bancshares, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such information to such other person or entity.

 
The merger agreement also provides that under certain circumstances as set forth therein the Bay Bancorp board of directors can approve or

recommend that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders approve what they have determined in good faith is a superior proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify
its recommendation in connection with the merger when the board of directors has in good faith determined that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties after consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and Hovde Group and RP
Financial.

 
Bay Bancorp has also agreed to notify Old Line Bancshares promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) if it receives any acquisition

proposal or request for information, negotiations or discussions with respect to any acquisition proposal, and to keep Old Line Bancshares informed
of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions. Bay Bancorp has further agreed to provide Old
Line Bancshares with the opportunity to present its own proposal to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors in response to any such proposal or offer, and
to negotiate with Old Line Bancshares in good faith with respect to any such proposal.

 
For a discussion of circumstances under which certain actions relating to Bay Bancorp or a subsidiary entering into an alternative

transaction could result in Bay Bancorp being required to pay a termination fee, see “– Bay Bancorp Termination Fee.”
 
Expenses
 
Each of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp will pay all of the costs and expenses that it incurs in connection with the merger agreement

and the merger, including fees and expenses of financial consultants, accountants and legal counsel.
 
Regulatory Approvals
 
Completion of the merger is subject to the prior receipt of all approvals and consents of federal and state authorities required to complete the

merger of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp as well as the merger of Old Line Bank and Bay Bank.
 
Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the

merger and the bank merger. These approvals include, with respect to the merger, approval from the FRB and the Maryland Commissioner and, with
respect to the bank merger, approval from the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner. The merger cannot proceed without these required regulatory
actions.

 
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
 
Federal Reserve Board. The acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank holding company requires the prior approval of the

FRB under the BHC Act. Under this law, the FRB generally may not approve any proposed transaction:
 
· That would result in a monopoly or that would further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize banking in the United States; or

 

 98  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 107/225

 

 
· That could substantially lessen competition in any section of the country, that would tend to create a monopoly in any section of the

country, or that would be in restraint of trade, unless the FRB finds that the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the
communities served outweighs the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction.

 
The FRB is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and their subsidiary

banks and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Under the CRA, the FRB also must take into account the record of
performance of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp in meeting the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods. In addition, the FRB must take into account the effectiveness of the companies in combating money laundering activities. Among
other things, the FRB will evaluate the capital adequacy of the combined company after completion of the merger. The FRB also will take into
consideration the extent to which a proposed acquisition, merger or consolidation would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of
the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the FRB will provide an opportunity for public comment on the application for
the merger, and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceedings if it determines that would be appropriate. Any transaction approved by
the FRB generally may not be completed until 30 days after such approval, during which time the U.S. Department of Justice may challenge such
transaction on antitrust grounds and seek divestiture of certain assets and liabilities.

 
In addition, the acquisition by an entity of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares of a bank requires the prior approval of the FRB

under the BHC Act. We have estimated that the shares of Bay Bancorp common stock owned by H Bancorp will represent, upon exchange in
connection with the merger, approximately 6.7% of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock outstanding after the merger. In acting on H
Bancorp’s application, the FRB is required to consider all of the same factors that it will consider when acting on Old Line Bancshares’ application
relating to the merger.

 
Maryland Commissioner. The merger is subject to the prior approval of the Maryland Commissioner under Section 5-903 of the Financial

Institutions Article of the Maryland Annotated Code. In determining whether to approve the merger, the Maryland Commissioner will consider:
 
· Whether the merger may be detrimental to the safety and soundness of Bay Bank or Bay Bancorp; and

 
· Whether the merger may result in an undue concentration of resources or a substantial reduction of competition in the State of Maryland.

 
The Maryland Commissioner will not approve any acquisition if upon consummation the combined entity (including any of its bank

subsidiaries) would control 30% or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the State of Maryland, although the
Maryland Commissioner may waive this limitation upon good cause shown. Old Line Bank will not control 30% of the insured deposits in Maryland
after the merger.

 
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Bank Merger
 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank merger is subject to the prior approval of the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act. In

evaluating an application filed under the Bank Merger Act, the FDIC generally considers: (i) the competitive impact of the transaction; (ii) financial
and managerial resources of each bank that is a party to the bank merger; (iii) each of the banks’ effectiveness in combating money-laundering
activities; (iv) the convenience and needs of the communities in which the banks serve; and (v) the extent to which the bank merger would result in
greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. The FDIC also reviews the performance records of the
relevant depository institutions under the CRA, including their CRA ratings. In connection with its review under the Bank Merger Act, the FDIC will
provide an opportunity for public comment on the application for the bank merger, and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if it
determines that would be appropriate.

 
Maryland Commissioner. The bank merger is subject to the prior approval of the Maryland Commissioner under Section 3-703(c) of the

Financial Institutions Article of the Maryland Annotated Code. The Maryland Commissioner will approve the bank merger if it determines that: (i)
Old Line Bank meets all the requirements of Maryland law for the formation of a new commercial bank; (ii) the bank merger agreement provides an
adequate capital structure, including surplus, for Old Line Bank in relation to its deposit liabilities and other activities; (iii) the bank merger is fair;
and (iv) the proposed bank merger is not against the public interest.

OCC Notice. Pursuant to OCC rules, because Bay Bank is being merged into a state bank, prior OCC approval of the bank merger is not

required. However, Bay Bank must file a notice advising the OCC of Old Line Bank’s intention to acquire Bay Bank in the bank merger prior to
consummation of the bank merger.

 
Applications
 
Old Line Bancshares filed applications with the FRB and the Maryland Commissioner requesting approval of the merger of Bay Bancorp

with and into Old Line Bancshares, and Old Line Bank filed applications with the FDIC and Maryland Commissioner requesting the approval of the
merger of Bay Bank into Old Line Bank, on November 21, 2017. In addition, Bay Bank notified the OCC of the merger of Bay Bank into Old Line
Bank on November 21, 2017. H Bancorp filed an application with the FRB requesting approval to acquire more than 5% of Old Line Bank on
January 22, 2018. In general, the applications and the notice describe the terms of the merger or bank merger, the parties involved and the activities to
be conducted by the combined entities following consummation of the transaction, and will contain certain related financial and managerial
information.

 
We are not aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger or bank merger, except as

described above. If any other approval or action is required, we will use our best efforts to obtain such approval or action.
 
Management and Operations After the Merger
 
The current officers and directors of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, with the addition of Joseph J. Thomas, Bay Bancorp’s

President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric D. Hovde, who serves as Chairman of the boards of directors of both Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, and
Steven K. Breeden, a current director of Bay Bancorp (or such replacements as named in a schedule to the merger agreement if either of Messrs.
Thomas, Hovde or Breeden become disqualified to serve as directors pursuant to the merger agreement), to each entity’s board of directors, will
continue to be the officers and directors of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, respectively, after the merger.

 
Employment; Severance
 
Following the merger, Old Line Bancshares is not obligated to continue the employment of any employees of Bay Bancorp or its

subsidiaries. As a result of the merger, some Bay Bancorp positions will be eliminated. Old Line Bancshares will, however, endeavor to continue the
employment of all employees (as of August 4, 2017) of Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries (each a “Bay Employee”), including Bay Bank, in positions
that will contribute to the successful performance of the combined organization. If a Bay Employee is not so retained, or Old Line Bancshares elects
to eliminate a position or does not offer a Bay Employee comparable employment with Old Line Bancshares, Old Line Bank or another subsidiary of
Old Line Bancshares, or a Bay Employee that is offered and accepts employment with Old Line Bancshares, Old Line Bank or another subsidiary of
Old Line Bancshares but is terminated without “cause” (as defined in the merger agreement) within six months after the date that the merger is
effective (in each case, a “Displaced Employee”), then Old Line Bancshares will make, or cause Old Line Bank or the other applicable Old Line
Bancshares subsidiary to make, a severance payment to such Displaced Employee as follows:

 
· With respect to non-exempt Displaced Employees, two weeks of severance pay plus one additional week of severance pay for each full

year of employment with Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary, up to a maximum of 12 weeks of severance pay;
 

· With respect to Displaced Employees who are exempt officers or employees of Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary with less than
five full years of employment with Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary, six weeks of severance pay plus one additional week of
severance pay for each full year of employment with Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary, up to a maximum of ten weeks of
severance pay; and

 
· With respect to Displaced Employees who are exempt officers or employees of Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary with at least

five full years of employment with Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp Subsidiary, 12 weeks of severance pay plus two additional weeks of
severance pay for each full year of employment with Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary beyond five years of employment, up to
a maximum of 26 weeks of severance pay.

9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 109/225

 

 
Such severance payments will be calculated based on the applicable Displaced Employee’s base salary or other base rate of pay in effect for

such Displaced Employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Years of employment will be based on the applicable Displaced
Employee’s number of full years employed with Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp Subsidiary or any predecessor thereto.

 
Bay Employees who are a party to any employment, severance or “change in control” agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that

would provide for a payment triggered by the merger or the bank merger, including as described under “– Interest of Directors and Officers in the
Merger – Golden Parachute Compensation for Bay Bancorp Named Executive Officers,” will not be eligible for such severance benefits unless such
person waives or relinquishes his or her right to such change in control payment.

 
Any Bay Employee whose employment with Old Line Bancshares or a subsidiary of Old Line Bancshares is terminated without cause after

six months from the effective date of the merger will receive such severance benefits from Old Line Bancshares or the Old Line Bancshares
subsidiary as is provided for in Old Line Bancshares’ or such subsidiary’s general severance policy for such terminations (with full credit being given
for each year of service with Bay Bancorp or any Bay Bancorp subsidiary).

 
All of the payments described in this section are subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory non-objections or waivers.
 
Employee Benefits
 
The merger agreement provides that as of the effective date of the merger, each Bay Employee who accepts employment with Old Line

Bancshares or a subsidiary thereof will be entitled to full credit for each year of service with Bay Bancorp or any subsidiary thereof for purposes of
determining eligibility for participation, vesting and benefit accrual in Old Line Bancshares’, or as appropriate, in the Old Line Bancshares
subsidiary’s, employee benefit plans, programs and policies, except as prohibited by Law. Old Line Bancshares will use the original date of hire by
Bay Bancorp or a Bay Bancorp subsidiary in making such determinations. After the effective date of the merger, Old Line Bancshares may
discontinue or amend, or convert to or merge with an Old Line Bancshares benefit plan, any Bay Bancorp benefit plan, subject to the plan’s
provisions and applicable Law.

 
Interests of Directors and Officers in the Merger
 

Certain members of management of Bay Bancorp and its board of directors may have interests in the merger in addition to their interests as
stockholders of Bay Bancorp. The Bay Bancorp board of directors was aware of these factors and considered them, among other factors, in
approving the merger agreement and the merger.

 
Golden Parachute Compensation for Bay Bancorp Named Executive Officers
 
As of April 14, 2017, prior to any discussions with Old Line Bancshares, Bay Bank and Bay Bancorp and Joseph J. Thomas, their President

and Chief Executive Officer, entered into an employment agreement with respect to Mr. Thomas’ service as Bay Bank’s President and Chief
Executive Officer. In addition, Bay Bank and its Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Larry D. Pickett, are parties to an employment
agreement dated as of January 2, 2014. These agreements include change in control severance arrangements, and the compensation that can be paid
under these arrangements constitute “golden parachute compensation” within the meaning of Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K. Section 14A
of the Exchange Act requires the board of directors of Bay Bancorp to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote from its stockholders with respect to any
golden parachute compensation that could be paid pursuant to any agreement or understanding between Bay Bancorp and any of its “named
executive officers” (within the meaning of Item 402 of Regulation S-K) in connection with a merger for which the board is soliciting proxies.
Accordingly, stockholders of Bay Bancorp will be asked at the special meeting to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote on the golden parachute
compensation that could be paid to Messrs. Thomas and Pickett under their employment agreements. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Bay Bancorp Special Meeting – Purpose of the Special Meeting.”

Under his employment agreement, Mr. Thomas will be entitled to a lump sum cash payment and certain other benefits if (i) his employment

is terminated without Cause, as defined in the agreement, (ii) he terminates his employment for Good Reason, as defined in the agreement, or (iii) his
employment agreement is not renewed, in each case within three months before or 12 months after a Change in Control, as defined in the agreement.
In addition, under his employment agreement, Mr. Pickett is entitled to a lump sum cash payment if within 180 days of the closing of a transaction
that constitutes a Change in Control, as defined in the agreement, Mr. Pickett’s employment is terminated Cause (as defined in the agreement)
(including by not renewing his employment agreement at the end of its term), or he terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in the
agreement).

 
The merger will constitute a Change in Control for purposes of both Mr. Thomas’ and Mr. Pickett’s employment agreements, and Old Line

Bancshares agreed in the merger agreement to pay any amount that may become payable to any Bay Employees under existing employment
agreements in connection with the merger. Accordingly, if payable, such compensation will be paid by Old Line Bancshares after consummation of
the merger. The following table describes the golden parachute compensation that could be paid to Messrs. Thomas and Pickett under their
employment agreements.

Other Payments to Directors and Executive Officers of Bay Bancorp
 
As discussed above, all Bay Employees, including James W. Kirschner, Senior Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of Bay Bank, and

Deanna L. Lintz, Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer of Bay Bank, who either are not retained by Old Line Bancshares or Old Line
Bank or another Old Line Bancshares subsidiary in the merger or are retained but are thereafter terminated without “cause” (as defined in the merger
agreement) within six months of the merger, will receive a severance payment as outlined in “– Employment; Severance” above.

 
No Golden Parachute or Other Compensation Payable to Old Line Bancshares Named Executive Officers
 
None of Old Line Bancshares’ executive officers will receive any type of “golden parachute” or other compensation that is based on or that

otherwise relates to the merger.
 
Indemnification and Insurance
 
Old Line Bancshares has agreed that for six years and one day after the effective date of the merger, it will indemnify and hold harmless

each present and former director and officer of Bay Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred thereafter in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the merger, based or arising out of, or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or officer of Bay Bancorp or any of its
subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Bay Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, trustee or other agent of any
other organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of Bay Bancorp, including any matters arising in connection with or
related to the negotiation, execution and performance of the merger agreement or the merger or the bank merger, and will advance expenses to such
persons in connection therewith, to the fullest extent to which such officers and directors would have been entitled to indemnification and
advancement of expenses under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Bay Bancorp in effect on September 27, 2017, as though such persons
were present or former officers of Old line Bancshares, or were serving at the request of Old Line Bancshares or any of its subsidiaries, or as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or other agent of any organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of Old Line
Bancshares, as of the effective time of the merger.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 111/225

 

 
Old Line Bancshares has further agreed that for a minimum of six years and one day after the merger’s effective date, Old Line Bancshares

will, at its expense, maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the former directors and officers of Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries with
respect to matters occurring at or prior to the merger’s effective time (a “tail” policy), so long as the policy can be obtained at a cost not in excess of
an aggregate of 150% of the current annual premium attributable to the applicable officers’ and directors’ liability insurance coverage in Bay
Bancorp’s or Bay Bank’s liability insurance policy(ies) in effect on September 27, 2017. If Old Line Bancshares is unable to purchase the tail policy
at a cost not in excess of such amount, Old Line Bancshares will obtain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance tail policy with the maximum
coverage reasonably available for a cost that does not exceed such amount.

 
Board Positions and Compensation
 
Upon completion of the merger and the subsequent bank merger, Eric D. Hovde, Joseph J. Thomas and Steven K. Breeden will be elected to

the boards of directors of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank and will be entitled to compensation in such capacity on the same basis as other
Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank directors. Currently, each non-employee director of Old Line Bank, other than the Chairman of the Board
and the Vice Chairman of the Board, receives $700 for each attended meeting of the board of directors, $300 for each attended meeting of the loan
committee and $400 for each attended meeting of the corporate governance committee, the compensation committee, the audit committee, the risk
committee, the strategic opportunities committee and the asset and liability committee of the board of directors. The Chairs of each of the corporate
governance, compensation, risk and audit committees also receive an additional $300 for each attended meeting of their respective committees. If a
director attends any of these meetings via teleconference in lieu of in person, the director receives $200 instead of the regular in-person payment.
Each non-employee director of Old Line Bank, other than the Chairman of the Board and the Vice Chairman of the Board, also receive an $8,400
quarterly retainer.

 
In addition, pursuant to a resolution adopted by Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors in 2012, directors who retire from the board with at

least seven years of service receive a payment of $50,000, payable in three annual installments. Board members are also eligible for equity grants
pursuant to Old Line Bancshares’ equity compensation plans.

 
Support Agreements
 
As a condition to Old Line Bancshares entering into the merger agreement, all the directors of Bay Bancorp, who in the aggregate have the

power to vote 33.8% of shares outstanding on the record date for Bay Bancorp’s special meeting, entered into an agreement with Old Line
Bancshares, dated as of September 27, 2017, pursuant to which each such director agreed to vote all of his shares of Bay Bancorp common stock in
favor of the merger. A form of support agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.3 to Old Line Bancshares’ Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K
filed on September 28, 2017. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” The support agreements may have the effect of discouraging persons
from making a proposal for an acquisition transaction involving Bay Bancorp. The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the
support agreements.

 
Pursuant to the support agreements, each director of Bay Bancorp (as well as Bay Bancorp’s largest stockholder, whose shares are voted by

Eric D. Hovde, Chairman of the Board of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank) agreed, among other things:
 
· To vote, or cause to be voted, at any meeting of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders or other circumstance in which the vote, consent or other

approval of stockholders is sought, all of the Bay Bancorp common stock as to which he or it is the record or beneficial owner (a) for
approval of the merger and the execution and delivery by Bay Bancorp of the merger agreement, (b) against any superior Bay Bancorp
transaction, and (c) against certain other actions or proposals that are intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone or materially adversely affect the merger, the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

 
· To take all reasonable actions to and assist in the consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement, and to use his or its best efforts to cause Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries to take the actions set forth in the merger
agreement.

 
· To continue to hold his or its shares of Bay Bancorp common stock until the earlier of the time the merger is effective or the date the Bay

Bancorp stockholders approve the merger agreement.

· Not to exercise his or its appraisal rights.

 
· Not to take any action that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or disabling him or it from performing his or its

obligations under the support agreement.
 

Investment Banking Fees
 
Steven D. Hovde, a director of Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, is also the President and Chief Executive Officer of Hovde Group, which served

as a financial advisor to Bay Bancorp in connection with the merger and has received and will receive certain fees in connection with that
engagement. Consequently, Steven D. Hovde has a financial interest in the completion of the merger. Pursuant to Bay Bancorp’s engagement
agreement with Hovde Group, Hovde Group received from Bay Bancorp a $100,000 fairness opinion fee upon the delivery of Hovde Group’s
fairness opinion to Bay Bancorp’s board of directors. Additionally, Hovde Group will receive a completion fee equal to 1.0% of the transaction value
that is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. For this purpose, the transaction value will include the aggregate merger consideration plus
the aggregate amount of cash paid in exchange for any Bay Bancorp stock option that remains unexercised as of the effective time of the merger. Bay
Bancorp anticipates that the amount of this completion fee will be between approximately $1.25 million and $1.30 million, although the exact
amount of that fee will depend on the final calculation of the aggregate merger consideration and the number and terms and conditions of any Bay
Bancorp stock options that remain unexercised as of the effective time of the merger. The opinion fee will be credited in full toward the portion of the
completion fee that will become payable to Hovde Group upon the consummation of the merger. In the event that the merger agreement is terminated
and Old Line Bancshares is obligated to pay the $5,076,000 termination fee to Bay Bancorp, then Hovde Group will be entitled to $761,400, or 15%
of that termination fee. In addition to Hovde Group’s fees, and regardless of whether the merger is consummated, Bay Bancorp has agreed to
reimburse Hovde Group for certain of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Bay Bancorp has also agreed to indemnify Hovde Group and its
affiliates for certain liabilities that may arise out of the engagement.

 
Accounting Treatment
 

The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Old Line Bancshares treated as the acquirer. Under this
method of accounting, Bay Bancorp’s assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts and other
commitments) will be recorded by Old Line Bancshares at their respective fair values as of the closing date of the merger and added to those of Old
Line Bancshares. Any excess of purchase price over the net fair values of Bay Bancorp’s assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. Financial
statements of Old Line Bancshares issued after the merger will reflect these values, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical
financial position or results of operations of Bay Bancorp prior to the merger. The results of operations of Bay Bancorp will be included in the results
of operations of Old Line Bancshares beginning on the effective date of the merger.

 
Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences
 

The closing of the merger is conditioned upon (i) the receipt by Old Line Bancshares of the opinion of Baker Donelson, counsel to Old Line
Bancshares, and (ii) the receipt by Bay Bancorp of the opinion of Gordon Feinblatt, counsel to Bay Bancorp, each dated as of the effective date of the
merger, to the effect that:

 
· The merger constitutes a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; and

 
· Only as to the opinion to be received by Bay Bancorp, any gain realized in the merger will be recognized only to the extent of cash or

other property (other than Old Line Bancshares common stock) received in the merger, including cash received in lieu of fractional share
interests.

 
The tax opinions to be delivered in connection with the merger are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither Bay Bancorp nor Old

Line Bancshares intends to request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger.
Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth
below. In addition, if any of the facts, representations or assumptions upon which the opinions are based is inconsistent with the actual facts, the
United States federal income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected.

The following discussion describes the anticipated material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined

below) of Bay Bancorp common stock. The discussion is based upon the opinion of Gordon Feinblatt, filed with the registration statement of which
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code and that stockholders who receive Old Line Bancshares common stock will not recognize a gain or loss with respect to their receipt of
the shares, except with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares. This discussion addresses only those holders that hold their Bay
Bancorp common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code and does not address all the U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their individual circumstances or to holders that are subject to special
rules, such as:

 
· financial institutions;

The following is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, its legislative history, United States Department of the Treasury regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and published rulings and decisions, all as currently in effect as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Tax considerations

Holders of Bay Bancorp common stock should consult with their own tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the

merger as well as the effect of state, local, foreign and other tax laws and of proposed changes to applicable tax laws, in light of their particular

· a corporation, or entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States; or

 
· otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis.

 
The U.S. federal income tax consequences of a partner in a partnership holding Bay Bancorp common stock generally will depend on the

status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. We recommend that partners in such a partnership consult their own tax advisers.
 
Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally
 
As a result of the merger qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the following

material U.S. federal income tax consequences will result:
 
Receipt of Old Line Bancshares Common Stock. No gain or loss will be recognized by a Bay Bancorp stockholder with respect to their

receipt of shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock (except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, as discussed below) in exchange for his
or her shares of Bay Bancorp common stock. The tax basis of the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock received by a Bay Bancorp
stockholder in such exchange will be equal (except for the basis attributable to any fractional shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock, as
discussed below) to the basis of the Bay Bancorp common stock surrendered in exchange for the Old Line Bancshares common stock. The holding
period of the Old Line Bancshares common stock received will include the holding period of shares of Bay Bancorp common stock surrendered in
exchange for the Old Line Bancshares common stock, provided that such shares were held as capital assets of the Bay Bancorp stockholder at the
effective time of the merger.

 
Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. A Bay Bancorp stockholder who holds Bay Bancorp common stock as a capital asset and who receives,

in exchange for such stock, shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock and cash in lieu of a fractional share interest in Old Line Bancshares
common stock will be treated as having received such cash in full payment for such fractional share of stock and as capital gain or loss.
 

Tax Treatment of the Entities. No gain or loss will be recognized by Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp as a result of the merger.
 

Reporting Requirements
 
Bay Bancorp stockholders will be required to retain records pertaining to the merger. Certain Bay Bancorp stockholders are subject to

certain reporting requirements with respect to the merger. In particular, such stockholders will be required to attach a statement to their tax returns for
the year of the merger that contains the information listed in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3(b). Such statement must include the stockholder’s
adjusted tax basis in its Bay Bancorp common stock and other information regarding the merger. Bay Bancorp stockholders are urged to consult with
their tax advisers with respect to these and other reporting requirements applicable to the merger.

 
THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX
EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO. BAY BANCORP STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS AS
TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
TAX RETURN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS), AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX
LAWS AND ANY PROPOSED CHANGES TO APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.

 
Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Certain Affiliates
 

The shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock to be issued in the merger will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for
shares issued to any stockholder who is an “affiliate” of Old Line Bancshares as defined by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Affiliates consist of
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Old Line Bancshares, and include the executive officers and
directors of Old Line Bancshares and may include significant stockholders of Old Line Bancshares following the merger.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 115/225

 

 
Stock Exchange Listing
 

Following the merger, the shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the
symbol “OLBK.”

 
No Appraisal Rights
 

Neither the holders of Old Line Bancshares common stock nor the holders of Bay Bancorp common stock have the right to demand and
receive the fair value of their stock from Old Line Bancshares or Bay Bancorp in connection with the merger and/or to seek an appraisal to determine
such fair value because the common stock of Old Line Bancshares and the common stock of Bay Bancorp are listed on Nasdaq and the circumstances
surrounding the merger do not satisfy all of the conditions set forth in Section 3-202(d) of the MGCL that would trigger such appraisal rights.

 
LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER

 
On December 14, 2017, Adam Franchi, both individually and on behalf of a putative class of Bay Bancorp’s stockholders, filed a complaint

in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Bay Bancorp and its directors as well as Old Line Bancshares. The complaint
asks the Court, among other things, to enjoin the parties from proceeding with the merger based, primarily, on allegations that the version of the joint
proxy statement/prospectus that was filed with the SEC on November 22, 2017 omitted certain material information in violation of Section 14(a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Old Line Bancshares is liable for the purported
violations because it acted as a controlling person of Bay Bank.

 
The defendants believe that this action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.
 

BAY BANCORP – INFORMATION ABOUT DIRECTORS TO BE ELECTED TO OLD LINE BANCSHARES’ BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 

As discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the merger agreement provides that Eric D. Hovde, Joseph J. Thomas and
one other current director of Bay Bancorp on which Bay Bancorp and Old Line Bancshares agree will be elected to the board of directors of Old Line
Bancshares at the effective time of the merger (the “Continuing Directors”). The parties have agreed that Steven K. Breeden, a current director of
Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank, will be elected to serve on the boards of Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank following the merger. Certain
information about the Continuing Directors is provided below. All other information about the Continuing Directors that is required to be included in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is incorporated by reference to that information in the portions of Bay Bancorp’s definitive proxy statement on
Schedule 14A for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, filed with the SEC on April 12, 2017, that are deemed to be incorporated by reference into
Bay Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Incorporation of Certain Documents By Reference” on
page 114.

 
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions
 

The following paragraphs discuss related party transactions that occurred to date in 2018 as well as in 2017 and 2016 and related party
transactions that are contemplated during 2018 (other than compensation paid or awarded to Bay Bancorp’s directors and executive officers) with
respect to the Continuing Directors. For this purpose, the term “related party transaction” is generally defined as any transaction (or series of related
transactions) in which (i) Bay Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds the lesser of (a) $120,000 or (b)
1.0% of Bay Bancorp’s average total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and (iii) any director, director nominee or executive
officer of Bay Bancorp or any person who beneficially owns more than 5% of its outstanding shares of common stock (and the immediate family
members and affiliates of the foregoing) has a direct or indirect interest. The term includes most financial transactions and arrangements, such as
loans, guarantees and sales of property, and remuneration for services rendered (as an employee, consultant or otherwise) to Bay Bancorp and its
subsidiaries.

 
Related party transactions during 2016 included payments to H Bancorp for services rendered to Bay Bancorp and Bay Bank totaling

$144,000 (Bay Bancorp did not make any payments to H Bancorp during 2017 or to date during 2018. Eric D. Hovde owns a 61.70% interest in H
Bancorp. In addition to the foregoing, during 2018 to date and during 2017 and 2016, Bay Bancorp, through Bay Bank, had banking transactions in
the ordinary course of its business with Bay Bancorp’s directors, director nominees, executive officers, 5% or greater stockholders and immediate
family members and affiliates of the foregoing. All of these transactions were substantially the same terms, including interest rates, collateral, and
repayment terms on loans, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not related to Bay Bancorp and its
subsidiaries. The extensions of credit to these persons by Bay Bank have not had and do not currently involve more than the normal risk of
collectability or present other unfavorable features.

 

 107  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 116/225

 

 
Bay Bancorp uses the following guidelines to determine the impact of a credit relationship on a director’s independence. It considers

extensions of credit which comply with Regulation O, promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to be consistent with
director independence. In other words, Bay Bancorp does not consider normal, arm’s-length credit relationships entered into in the ordinary course of
business to negate a director’s independence.

 
Regulation O requires that loans to directors and executive officers be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and

collateral, and following credit-underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by
Bay Bancorp with persons who are not related to Bay Bancorp or Bay Bank. Such loans also may not involve more than the normal risk of
repayment or present other unfavorable features. Additionally, no event of default may have occurred (that is, such loans are not disclosed as non-
accrual, past due, restructured, or potential problems). The audit committee must review and approve any credit to a director or his or her related
interests and submit such transaction to the full board of directors for approval.

 
In addition, Bay Bancorp does not consider as independent, for the purpose of voting on any such loans, any director who is also an

executive officer of a company to which Bay Bank has extended credit unless such credit meets the substantive requirements of Regulation O.
Similarly, Bay Bancorp does not consider independent any director who is an executive officer of a company that makes payments to, or receives
payments from, Bay Bancorp for property or services in an amount which, in any fiscal year, is greater than 2% of such company’s consolidated
gross revenues.

 
There have been no transactions between Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank and Messrs. Hovde, Thomas or Breeden.
 

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS
 

Upon completion of the merger, stockholders of Bay Bancorp will become stockholders of Old Line Bancshares. Accordingly, their rights as

The following is a summary of material differences in the rights of Old Line Bancshares stockholders and Bay Bancorp stockholders. This

discussion is not a complete statement of all differences affecting the rights of stockholders. We qualify this discussion in its entirety by reference to

Voting Rights Generally
 

Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation provide that holders of its common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of
common stock held. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.

 
Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation provide that holders of its common stock have the right to one vote for

each share of common stock held. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.
 
Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation provide that any “business combination” involving the company, including: (i) a merger or

exceeding 10% of the company’s assets to any one or more interested stockholders; (iii) the issuance by Old Line Bancshares or any subsidiary of
any securities to any “interested stockholder” having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than 10% of the combined assets of Old Line
Bancshares and its subsidiaries, except pursuant to an employee benefit plan; (iv) reclassifications, recapitalizations, mergers or consolidations that
increase the amount of Old Line Bancshares securities owned by an interested stockholder; and (v) the adoption of any plan of liquidation or

In addition, Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation provide that the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of its assets or a

merger or consolidation of Old Line Bancshares with or into another corporation requires the approval of holders of only a majority of the shares of
each class of its stock outstanding and entitled to vote if such transaction is approved by a majority of the board of directors. Without such a charter
provision, the MGCL provides that the required vote for such transactions is two-thirds of each class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote.

 
Evaluation of Business Combinations
 

Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation provide that, in connection with a potential transaction that would or may involve a
change in control of Bay Bancorp, its board of directors may consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to: (i) the economic effect on Bay
Bancorp’s stockholders; (ii) the social and economic effect on the employees, depositors and customers of, and others dealing with, Bay Bancorp and
its subsidiaries and on the communities in which Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries operate or are located; (iii) whether the proposal is acceptable
based on Bay Bancorp’s historical and current operating results or financial condition; (iv) whether a more favorable price could be obtained for Bay
Bancorp’s stock or other securities in the future; (v) the reputation and business practices of the offeror and its management and affiliates as they
would affect the employees of Bay Bancorp and its subsidiaries; (vi) the future value of Bay Bancorp’s stock or other securities; and (vii) any
antitrust or other legal and regulatory issues that are raised by the proposal. Further, Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation provide that if its board
of directors determines that any actual or proposed transaction that would or may involve a change in control should be rejected, it may take any
lawful action to defeat such transaction, including, but not limited to: advising stockholders not to accept the proposal; instituting litigation against
the party making the proposal; filing complaints with governmental and regulatory authorities; acquiring the stock or any of the securities of Bay
Bancorp; selling or otherwise issuing authorized but unissued stock, other securities or treasury stock or granting options with respect thereto;
acquiring a company to create an antitrust or other regulatory problem for the party making the proposal; and obtaining a more favorable offer from
another individual or entity.

 
Old Line Bancshares. Neither Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation nor bylaws contain any similar provisions regarding the

evaluation of potential changes in control.

Bay Bancorp. Pursuant to the MGCL, a merger or consolidation of Bay Bancorp with or into another corporation, or the sale, lease or

Board of Directors
 

The MGCL provides that a Maryland corporation’s board of directors must consist of at least one director.
 
Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation provide that it shall have at least one director, and provide that the number of directors

shall be set, and may be increased or decreased, by its board of directors in accordance with its bylaws. Bay Bancorp’s bylaws provide that the
number of its directors shall be nine, and that the number of directors may be increased or decreased by the board of directors at any meeting thereof,
but never to less than one. Bay Bancorp’s directors are elected annually for one-year terms. Bay Bancorp currently has nine directors.

 
Pursuant to Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation, its directors may be removed, with or without cause, by a majority of the aggregate

number of votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.
 
Under Bay Bancorp’s bylaws, vacancies that occur on the board of directors may be filled by the board of directors or the stockholders.
 
Bay Bancorp’s bylaws require, except for directors who were serving as such on November 1, 2013, that no director who reaches age 70

may serve as a director beyond the expiration of his or her current term, and that no person who has attained the age of 70 will be eligible to be
elected as a director.

 
Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that its board of directors must be between five and

25 members, with the board having the power to set the number of directors within those limits. Pursuant to the bylaws, the directors are divided into
three classes, as even in number as possible, with the terms of the classes scheduled to expire in successive years. At each special meeting, Old Line
Bancshares’ stockholders elect the members of a single class of directors who are elected to three-year terms. Directors are elected by a plurality of
the votes cast. Old Line Bancshares currently has 15 directors.

 
Pursuant to Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of

holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors, and only after reasonable notice and opportunity for the
director to be heard before the body proposing to remove the director.

 
Under Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation, its board of directors has the authority to fill vacancies that occur on the board,

including vacancies caused by an increase in the number of directors, subject to the rights of holders of any preferred stock then outstanding.
 
Neither Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation or bylaws provide for an age at which directors are ineligible to run for re-election as

such or at which an individual is ineligible to be elected as a director. The board of directors has, however, adopted a resolution providing that no
individual may be nominated for election or re-election to the board of directors who is 75 years of age or older, unless such person is a founding
member of the board of directors or the board waives this provision with respect to a specific individual.

 
Nominations of Directors; Proposal of New Business
 

Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s bylaws provide that nominations of candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders
may be made (i) by, or at the direction of, a majority of the board of directors or (ii) by any stockholder entitled to vote at such annual meeting. A
stockholder nomination of a director must be made in writing and delivered to or received by Bay Bancorp not less than 60 days nor more than 90
days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that if less than 70 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the scheduled
annual meeting is given or made, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not later than the close of business on the
10th day following the earlier of the day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was mailed or the day on which such
public disclosure was made. Such stockholder’s notice must set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or
re-election as a director and as to the stockholder giving the notice (a) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (b) the
principal occupation or employment of such person, (c) the class and number of shares of Bay Bancorp stock that are beneficially owned by such
person on the date of such stockholder notice and (d) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of
proxies with respect to nominees for election as directors, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; and (ii) as to the stockholder giving
the notice (a) the name and address, as they appear on Bay Bancorp’s books, of such stockholder and any other stockholders known by such
stockholder to be supporting such nominees and (b) the class and number of shares of Bay Bancorp stock that are beneficially owned by such
stockholder on the date of such stockholder notice and by any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominees on the
date of such stockholder notice.

Neither Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation nor bylaws include requirements for the presentation by stockholders of other proposals at

an annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, a stockholder who desires to present a proposal at an annual meeting of stockholders of Bay Bancorp
must comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act if such stockholder wants the proposal included in Bay Bancorp’s proxy statement, and Rule
14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act a stockholder intends to present a proposal for business to be considered at the annual meeting of stockholders
but does not seek inclusion of the proposal in Bay Bancorp’s proxy statement for that meeting.

 
Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares’ bylaws provide that the board of directors or any stockholder of record (at the time of giving the

required notice) entitled to vote for the election of directors may make nominations for the election of directors.
 
Other than the existing board of directors, stockholders of Old Line Bancshares must make their nominations for director or proposals for an

annual meeting in writing to Old Line Bancshares’ Secretary. Nominations and proposals must be submitted not less than 60 nor more than 90 days
before the first anniversary of the date of the prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders, provided that if the date of the annual meeting is more than
30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date or no proxy statement was delivered in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting, the
notice must be delivered no later than 70 days before the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of the meeting is made. Notices of nominations must contain certain information regarding the identity, background and stock ownership of the
proposed nominee and the identity and stock ownership of the person making the nomination. Notices of other proposals must contain a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and certain
information about the proposing stockholder including stock holdings in Old Line Bancshares and any material interest of the stockholder in such
business.

 
Stockholders of Old Line Bancshares must also comply with Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 or 14a-4(c)(1), as applicable, in connection with

presenting proposals at an annual meeting of stockholders.
 

Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation
 

Bay Bancorp. Under the MGCL, amendments to Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation require the approval of its board of directors and
holders of two-thirds of all votes eligible to be cast on the matter.

 
Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation generally may be amended by affirmative vote of a majority of the

board of directors and the holders of at least two-thirds of the total votes eligible to be cast on the matter, provided that amendments to Article
FOURTH with respect to the election and removal of directors, article SEVENTH with respect to the vote required for certain business combinations
and article FOURTEENTH setting forth the general voting requirements to amend the articles of incorporation require the approval of 80% of the
total voting power of the company entitled to vote in the election of directors.

 
Amendments to Bylaws
 

Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s stockholders and board of directors may alter, amend and repeal the bylaws, except that the board of directors
may not alter or repeal any bylaws made by stockholders or the provision that allows the stockholders to alter, amend or repeal the bylaws.

 
Old Line Bancshares. In general, Old Line Bancshares’ board of directors has the power to alter, amend or repair its bylaws by a majority

vote of the board. Stockholders generally do not have the right to amend the bylaws.

Limited Liability
 

Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation provide that its directors and officers are not personally liable to Bay Bancorp or its
stockholders for money damages except:

 
· To the extent it is proved that such director or officer actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, for

the amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or services actually received; or
 

· To the extent that a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the director or officer is entered in a proceeding based on a finding in
the proceeding that such director’s or officer’s action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was
material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding.

 
Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation provide that its officers and directors are not personally liable to Old

Line Bancshares or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties, provided that such provision does not eliminate or
limit personal liability of an officer or director:

amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or services actually received;
 

· To the extent that a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the person is entered in a proceeding based on a finding in the
proceeding that the person’s action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of

· In an administrative proceeding or action instituted by an appropriate bank regulatory agency which proceeding or action results in a

final order requiring affirmative action by an individual or individuals in the form of payments to the company.
 
Indemnification
 

Bay Bancorp. Bay Bancorp’s bylaws provide that it will indemnify its present and former directors and officers, whether serving or having
served Bay Bancorp or at its request any other entity, to the full extent permissible under Maryland law.

 
The MGCL currently provides that a Maryland corporation may not indemnify a director or officer if it is established that:
 
· The act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was committed in bad faith or

was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;
 

· The director or officer actually received an improper benefit in money, property or services;
 

· In the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful; or
 

· In the case of a proceeding by or in the right of the company, the director or officer is adjudged to be liable to the company, unless the
court in which the suit was brought determines that indemnification is nevertheless proper, in which case indemnification is limited to
expenses.

 
Bay Bancorp’s articles of incorporation also provide that reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer who is or is threatened to be

made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, may be paid
or reimbursed by Bay Bancorp, upon the approval of the board of directors, in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding upon Bay Bancorp’s
receipt of (i) a written affirmation by the party seeking indemnification that he has a good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification as set forth above has been met and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the party seeking indemnification to repay the
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.

Old Line Bancshares. Old Line Bancshares’ articles of incorporation provide that, to the fullest extent under the MGCL, it will indemnify its

past, present and future directors and officers against all expenses, liability and losses reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which such officer or director is
a party or threatened to be made a party, by reason of his having been an officer or director of the company or, at the company’s request, any other
entity, provided, however, that the company will indemnify any such person in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if such
proceeding was authorized by the board of directors, except for a proceeding to enforce such person’s right to indemnification or advancement of
expenses.

 
Its articles of incorporation provide that Old Line Bancshares cannot indemnify any officer, director or employee against expenses, penalties

or other payments incurred in an administrative proceeding or action instituted by an appropriate bank regulatory agency which proceeding or action
results in a final order assessing civil monetary penalties or requiring affirmative action by an individual or individuals in the form of payments to the
company.

 
The articles of incorporation also provide for the right to advancement of expenses in connection with the indemnification rights set forth

above, provided such officer or director undertakes to reimburse such amounts if it is determined by a court that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and advancement of expenses. The articles of incorporation also permit Old Line Bancshares to indemnify any employee or agent to
the same extent as provided for officers and directors.

2018 ANNUAL MEETINGS

 
In order to be included in the proxy materials for Old Line Bancshares’ 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder proposals

submitted to Old Line Bancshares in compliance with SEC Rule 14a-8 (which concerns shareholder proposals that are requested to be included in a
company’s proxy statement) must be received in written form at Old Line Bancshares’ executive offices on or before December 21, 2017. In order to
curtail controversy as to compliance with this requirement, stockholders are urged to submit proposals to the Secretary of Old Line Bancshares by
Certified Mail—Return Receipt Requested.

 
Pursuant to the proxy rules under the Exchange Act, Old Line Bancshares’ stockholders are notified that the notice of any stockholder

proposal to be submitted outside of the Rule 14a-8 process for consideration at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by its
Secretary between February 23, 2018 and March 25, 2018; provided, however, that if the date of the 2018 annual meeting is advanced more than 30
days prior to May 24, 2018 or is delayed more than 60 days after such date, then to be timely such notice must be received by Old Line Bancshares
no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the
meeting is made. As to all such matters that Old Line Bancshares does not have notice on or prior to that date, discretionary authority to vote on such
proposal will be granted to the persons designated in Old Line Bancshares’ proxy related to the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.

 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for nominations for election to the board of directors at an annual meeting of stockholders

outside of the procedures established in the charter of the Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors of Old Line Bancshares and
even if the nomination is not to be included in the proxy statement, pursuant to Old Line Bancshares’ bylaws, the stockholder must give notice in
writing to the Secretary of Old Line Bancshares not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the preceding year’s annual
meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or is
delayed more than 60 days after such anniversary date, then to be timely such notice must be received by Old Line Bancshares no later than the later
of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting was made.

 
Please see Old Line Bancshares’ bylaws for a description of the information that must be contained in a notice for a stockholder proposal or

director nomination.
 
Bay Bancorp will hold a 2018 annual meeting of shareholders only if the merger is not completed. In that case, a Bay Bancorp stockholder

who desires to present a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act to be included in the proxy statement for and voted on at Bay
Bancorp’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders must submit such proposal in writing, including all supporting materials, to Bay Bancorp at its
executive offices no later than December 22, 2017 (i.e., 120 days prior to the date of mailing of the proxy statement for that meeting, based on the
proxy statement mailing date for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders) and meet all other requirements for inclusion in the proxy statement.
Additionally, pursuant to Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act, if a stockholder intends to present a proposal for business to be considered at the
2018 annual meeting of stockholders but does not seek inclusion of the proposal in Bay Bancorp’s proxy statement for that meeting, then Bay
Bancorp must receive the proposal by March 6, 2018 (i.e., 45 days prior to the date of mailing of the proxy statement for that meeting, based on the
proxy statement mailing date for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders) for it to be considered timely received. Rules 14a-8 and 14a-4(c)(1)
provide additional time constraints if the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders is changed by more than 30 days. If Bay Bancorp receives
a notice of a stockholder proposal that is not timely as set forth above, then the proxies will be authorized to exercise discretionary authority with
respect to the proposal.

In addition to any other applicable requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors of Bay Bancorp outside of the

procedures established by its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration of director candidates, and even if the nomination
is not to be included in the proxy statement, a stockholder of Bay Bancorp who is entitled to vote for the election of directors and who desires to
nominate a candidate for election to be voted on at an annual meeting of stockholders may do so only in accordance with Section 7 of Article I of
Bay Bancorp’s Bylaws. A stockholder’s notice shall be delivered to, or mailed to and received at, the principal executive offices of Bay Bancorp not
less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, as established pursuant to Section 1 of Article I of the Bay Bancorp
Bylaws, regardless of postponements, deferrals, or adjournments of that meeting to a later date; provided, however, that if less than 70 days’ notice or
prior public disclosure of the date of the scheduled annual meeting is given or made, then notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered
or received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which such notice of the date of the scheduled
annual meeting was mailed or the day on which such public disclosure was made. A stockholder’s notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom
the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director and as to the stockholder giving the notice (a) the name, age, business
address and residence address of such person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (c) the class and number of shares of Bay
Bancorp capital stock which are beneficially owned by such person on the date of such stockholder notice, and (d) any other information relating to
such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies with respect to nominees for election as directors, pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the Exchange Act; and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice, (a) the name and address, as they appear on the Bancorp’s books, of such
stockholder and any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominees and (b) the class and number of shares of Bay
Bancorp capital stock which are beneficially owned by such stockholder on the date of such stockholder notice and by any other stockholders known
by such stockholder to be supporting such nominees on the date of such stockholder notice.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the separate historical financial statements of Old

Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp after giving effect to the merger and the issuance of Old Line Bancshares common stock in connection therewith,
and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 is presented as if the merger with Bay Bancorp had occurred on
September 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 is presented as if the merger and Old Line Bancshares’ acquisition of DCB had occurred on January 1, 2016. The
historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are directly attributable to the merger and,
with respect to the income statements only, expected to have a continuing impact on consolidated results of operations.

 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting for

business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Old Line Bancshares is the acquirer for accounting
purposes. Old Line Bancshares has not had sufficient time to completely evaluate the significant identifiable long-lived tangible and identifiable
intangible assets of Bay Bancorp. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma adjustments, including the allocations of the purchase price, are preliminary
and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial information. Certain reclassifications
have been made to the historical financial statements of Bay Bancorp to conform to the presentation in Old Line Bancshares’ financial statements.

 
A final determination of the acquisition consideration and fair values of Bay Bancorp’s assets and liabilities, which cannot be made prior to

the completion of the merger, will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of Bay Bancorp that exist as of the date of completion of
the transaction. Consequently, amounts preliminarily allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangibles could change significantly from those
allocations used in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented below and could result in a material change in
amortization of acquired intangible assets.

 
In connection with the plan to integrate the operations of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp following the completion of the merger,

Old Line Bancshares anticipates that nonrecurring charges, such as costs associated with systems implementation, severance, and other costs related
to exit or disposal activities, could be incurred. Old Line Bancshares is not able to determine the timing, nature and amount of these charges as of the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. However, these charges could affect the results of operations of Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp,
as well as those of the combined company following the completion of the merger, in the period in which they are recorded. The unaudited pro forma
combined consolidated financial statements do not include the effects of the costs associated with any restructuring or integration activities resulting
from the transaction, as they are nonrecurring in nature and not factually supportable at the time that the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated
financial statements were prepared. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma adjustments do not give effect to any nonrecurring or unusual restructuring
charges that may be incurred as a result of the integration of the two companies or any anticipated disposition of assets that may result from such
integration. Direct transaction-related expenses estimated at $9.0 million are not included in the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated income
statements.

 
The actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the merger may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro

forma condensed combined financial statements as a result of:
 

• changes in the trading price for Old Line Bancshares’ common stock;
• net cash used or generated in Bay Bancorp’s operations between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger;
• the timing of the completion of the merger;

• other changes in Bay Bancorp’s net assets that occur prior to the completion of the merger, which could cause material differences in the

information presented below; and
• changes in the financial results of the combined company.

 
The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements are provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma

combined consolidated financial statements are not necessarily, and should not be assumed to be, an indication of the results that would have been
achieved had the transaction been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The preparation of the unaudited pro
forma combined consolidated financial statements and related adjustments required management to make certain assumptions and estimates. The
unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements should be read together with:

 
• the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements;
• Old Line Bancshares’ separate audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2016, included in Old Line Bancshares’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016;
• Old Line Bancshares’ separate unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the

nine months ended September 30, 2017, included in Old Line Bancshares’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2017;

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND STATEMENT OF INCOME
 

1. Old Line Bancshares will issue shares of its stock (“OLB Shares”) to stockholders of Bay Bancorp to effect the acquisition. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, each share of Bay Bancorp common stock (“BYBK Shares”) will be exchanged for a number of OLB
Shares (the “Per Share Consideration”) calculated by dividing $11.80 by the volume weighted average closing prices of Old Line
Bancshares common stock for the 20 trading days ending five trading days before the closing date of the Merger (the “Average Price”),
subject to a minimum Average Price of $25.65 and a maximum Average Price of $29.16 and adjustments for the proceeds recognized in the
recent settlement of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans. As such, the Per Share Consideration may be as low as 0.4047
OLB Shares if the Average Price is $29.16 or more and as high as 0.4600 OLB Shares if the Average Price is $25.65 or less, subject to the
adjustments provided for in the merger agreement. The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial information assumes that Old
Line Bancshares issues 4,669,584 shares (assuming an Average Price of $27.42 per share) of stock in exchange for Bay Bancorp stock
outstanding as of September 30, 2017. The OLB Shares to be issued includes OLB Shares equal in value to $1,546,490 in contingent
payments for the recent settlement of certain litigation and the resolution of certain loans. These assumptions result in an exchange ratio of
.4357 (calculated based on the number of shares of common stock of Bay Bancorp outstanding on September 30, 2017). The consideration
also includes cash of $1,203,732 for the value of unexercised Bay Bancorp stock options.

It is anticipated that Bay Bancorp’s stockholders will own approximately 27.25% of the voting stock of the combined company after the
acquisition. The shares of Old Line Bancshares common stock illustrated in this pro forma were assumed to be recorded at $27.42 per
share. Old Line Bancshares and Bay Bancorp cannot predict what the value or price of Old Line Bancshares’ stock will be at the closing
of the transaction or how the value or price of Old Line Bancshares’ stock may trade at any time, including the date hereof.

 
Old Line Bancshares will determine the final allocation of the purchase price after it has completed additional analysis to determine the
fair values of Bay Bancorp’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the date of the acquisition. Changes in the fair
value of the net assets of Bay Bancorp as of the date of the acquisition will likely change the amount of the purchase price allocable to
goodwill. The further refinement of transaction costs, changes in Bay Bancorp’s stockholders’ equity including net income between
September 30, 2017 and the date of the acquisition will likely change the amount of goodwill recorded. The final adjustments may be
materially different from the unaudited pro forma adjustments presented herein. Old Line Bancshares has prepared the pro forma
financial information to include the estimated adjustments necessary to record the assets and liabilities of Bay Bancorp at their respective
fair values and represents management’s best estimate based upon the information available at this time. The pro forma adjustments
included herein are subject to change as additional information becomes available and as we perform additional analyses. Furthermore,
Old Line Bancshares will determine the final allocation of the acquisition price after we complete the consolidation. The final acquisition
accounting adjustments may be materially different from the pro forma adjustment presented herein. Increases or decreases in the fair
value of certain balance sheet amounts including loans, securities, deposits and related intangibles and debt will result in adjustments to
the balance sheet and statement of operations. Such adjustments, when compared to the information shown in this document, may
change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill while changes to other assets and liabilities may impact the statement of
income due to adjustments in the yield and/or amortization/accretion of the adjusted assets and liabilities. We have included the
unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements only as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and the
year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information presented herein does not necessarily provide
an indication of the combined results of operations or the combined financial position that would have resulted had we actually
completed the consolidation as of the assumed consummation date, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the
future financial position of the combined company.
 
The total estimated purchase price for the purpose of this pro forma financial information is $129.2 million. The following table provides
the calculation and allocation of the purchase price used in the pro forma financial statements and a reconcilement of pro forma shares
outstanding.

3. Adjustment of $2.4 million to core deposit intangible to reflect the fair value of this asset and the related amortization adjustment based

upon an expected life of 10 years and using a straight line method. We expect the amortization of the core deposit intangible to increase
pro forma before tax non- interest expense by $240 thousand in the first year following consummation.

4. Adjustments to reflect the fair value of loans include:
 

a. An adjustment of $4.0 million to reflect the removal of the allowance for loan losses in connection with applying acquisition accounting
under ASC 805. We will apply this adjustment to loans accounted for within the scope of ASC 310-30 (ASC 310-30 occurs as a result of
the accounting for the differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor’s initial
investment in loans, including those acquired in a business combination, if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit
quality considerations). Old Line Bank’s management and independent loan review personnel determined this amount based on a review
of Bay Bancorp loans. This review considered payment history, relevant collateral values, debt service coverage ratios and other factors.
There is no estimated accretion for this credit quality adjustment in the pro forma statement of income.

 
b. An additional adjustment of $400,000 for loans accounted for within the scope of ASC 310-30 as outlined above. There is no estimated

accretion for this credit quality adjustment in the pro forma statement of income.
 

c. An adjustment of $3.8 million for loans accounted for within the scope of ASC 310-20 at acquisition. To determine the fair value of the
loans within the scope of ASC 310-20, Old Line Bank’s management and independent loan review personnel evaluated Bay Bancorp’s
loan portfolio and considered the risk characteristics within various pools of loans within the remaining loan portfolio. This review
included payment history, concentrations, quality of underwriting and economic weaknesses. We anticipate this adjustment will have no
impact on pro forma before tax income.

 
d. An adjustment of $3.6 million to eliminate the deferred fees associated with acquired loans. We anticipate this adjustment will decrease

pro forma before tax interest income by $830 thousand.
 

e. The following table reconciles the total loan adjustments:
 

ASC 310-30 (Allowance)  $ 4,049,647 
ASC 310-30   (400,000)
ASC 310-20   (3,802,092)
Deferred fees   3,590,051 
Total Loan Adjustments  $ 3,437,606 
 
f. Bay Bancorp has $3.2 million of credit and fair value marks on $27.7 million of purchased credit impaired loans acquired in prior merger

transactions. Of this amount $595,000 represents non-accretable discounts. Loan interest income for Bay Bancorp includes approximately
$1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $888,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. We have not eliminated
these items from the pro forma financial statements because we believe they represent a fair estimate of the discounts and accretion expected
upon completion of the merger.

 
5. An adjustment of $229,000 to reflect the fair value of other real estate owned, based on Old Line Bank’s management detailed

analysis of these assets that included site visits where possible and current tax assessed values. There is no estimated income for this
adjustment in the pro forma statement of income.

 
6. Adjustment to reflect the net deferred tax at a rate of 39.445% related to fair value adjustments on the balance sheet and a statutory tax

rate of 39.445% for book tax expense. We have not taken a tax benefit for certain merger obligations and cost that we do not consider
tax deductible.

7. Adjustment to remove net income from discontinued operations from Bay Bancorp. This is considered a non-recurring item.
 

8. We determine basic earnings per common share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding.

 
a. We calculate diluted earnings per common share by including the average dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the

period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of stock options, calculated using the treasury stock method.
 

b. For pro forma basic and diluted earnings per common share we have assumed that the shares issued at acquisition are outstanding for
the entire nine month or twelve month period, respectively.

Total average common shares including dilutive  shares   17,303,724   17,162,159 

 
9. In conjunction with the merger we expect to incur approximately $9.0 million in expenses associated with conversion of data processing

systems, severance, facility consolidation, fixed asset disposal, legal, accounting and consulting fees. Through September 30, 2017, we
have not incurred any expenses associated with the merger.

 
10. Estimated reduction in depreciation related to $1.4 million of fixed asset fair value adjustments associated with the acquisition of DCB.

 
11. Estimated additional core deposit premium amortization related to $3.7 million of cored deposit premium associated with the acquisition

of DCB.
 

12. Estimated accretion of the $706,000 in fair value adjustments on time deposits associated with the acquisition of DCB.
 

13. Estimated accretion of the $1.1 million of fair value adjustments on loans associated with the acquisition of DCB.
 

14. Estimated tax effect of the adjustments listed in notes 9 through 12.

Subject to any adjustments occurring after the date hereof as contemplated by Section 2.6 below, in the event that the Average Price is:

number of shares of BYBK Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such BYBK Common Stock Option by (ii) the difference between (A) the
Average Price multiplied by the Per Share Consideration (after giving effect to Section 2.6 of this Agreement) and (B) the exercise price per share of
BYBK Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such BYBK Common Stock Option. If such amount is a negative number, the BYBK Common
Stock Option shall be terminated without any payment therefor. Prior to the Effective Time, BYBK shall (i) obtain any necessary consents or make
any necessary amendments to the terms of any outstanding BYBK Common Stock Options to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.1(b), (ii) take all actions as may be necessary to terminate (and, except as provided in this Section 2.1(b), ensure that neither BYBK nor
Bay Bank remains bound by or liable for) any outstanding BYBK Common Stock Options or other Rights to acquire BYBK Common Stock and (iii)
ensure that any BYBK plans, agreements or other arrangements that allow the grant of BYBK Common Stock Options or other Rights in respect to

continue to be issued and outstanding.

 
Section 2.3                  Fractional Shares.
 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fractional shares of OLB Common Stock and no scrip, book-entry shares or
certificates therefor shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no dividend or distribution with respect to OLB Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of OLB. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, OLB shall pay to each former holder of BYBK Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of OLB Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent and without
interest, equal to the product of (a) the fraction of a share of OLB Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (b)
the Average Price. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all shares of BYBK Common Stock owned by a BYBK Common
Stockholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of OLB Common Stock issuable to such BYBK Common
Stockholder.

Section 2.4                  Objecting BYBK Common Stockholders.
 

(a)        Any Objecting BYBK Shares will not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration under this
Agreement, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 3-202 of the MGCL.

 
(b)        If any holder of Objecting BYBK Shares shall have failed to comply with Section 3-203 of the MGCL, or shall have effectively

withdrawn or lost the right granted thereunder, the Objecting BYBK Shares held by such holder shall be converted into a right to receive the Per
Share Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

 
(c)        All payments in respect of Objecting BYBK Shares, if any, will be made by OLB.
 
(d)        BYBK shall give OLB prompt (but in any event within two Business Days) written notice of any demands for appraisal of any

shares of BYBK Common Stock and any withdrawals of such demands, and OLB shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. BYBK shall not, except with the prior written consent of OLB, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

 
Section 2.5                  Exchange Fund; Exchange of BYBK Certificates.
 

(a)        Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, on or immediately prior to the Closing Date, OLB shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, in trust with or otherwise make available to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the BYBK Common Stockholders, for exchange in
accordance with this Agreement, through the Exchange Agent, (i) evidence of OLB Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section
2.1(a) for shares of OLB Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued to the BYBK Common Stockholders and (ii) cash
sufficient to pay holders of what would have been fractional shares of OLB Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Agreement (collectively,
the “Exchange Fund”).

 
(b)        As a condition to receiving the Per Share Consideration for each share of BYBK Common Stock held, each BYBK Common

Stockholder shall be required to duly execute and deliver to the Exchange Agent a letter of transmittal (each, a “Letter of Transmittal”). As promptly
as practicable, but in any event no later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, and provided that BYBK has delivered, or caused to
be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a BYBK Certificate a Letter of Transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the BYBK Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the BYBK Certificate to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the BYBK Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided for in this Agreement (such Letter of
Transmittal and instructions to include applicable provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s message” or other appropriate instructions with
respect to BYBK Certificates that are book-entry shares). Each BYBK Common Stockholder, upon proper surrender of BYBK Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by duly executed Letters of Transmittal, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Merger Consideration
to which such BYBK Common Stockholder shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a), and/or (ii) a check representing
the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares that such holder has the right to receive hereunder. Each BYBK Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each BYBK Certificate will be deemed for all purposes after the Effective Time to represent and evidence solely the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid therefor pursuant to this Agreement. Except as required by Law, no interest shall be payable with
respect to the cash payable for fractional shares or the cash payable for Objecting Shares. If any BYBK Common Stockholder is unable to locate any
BYBK Certificate(s) to be surrendered for exchange, the Exchange Agent shall deliver the corresponding share of the Merger Consideration to the
registered stockholder thereof upon receipt of a lost certificate affidavit and an indemnity agreement in a form acceptable to the Exchange Agent and
OLB.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 159/225

 

(c)        The delivery of the Merger Consideration following the Closing by the Exchange Agent shall occur as soon as practicable following
the Exchange Agent’s receipt of the applicable BYBK Certificate(s) and duly executed Letters of Transmittal. Unless otherwise agreed to by OLB,
the shares of OLB Common Stock delivered to each BYBK Common Stockholder pursuant to the Merger shall be in book-entry form.

 
(d)        No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to OLB Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be

paid to the holder of any unsurrendered BYBK Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such BYBK Certificate(s) in accordance with this
Section 2.5. Pending such surrender, any dividend or distribution payable in respect of such shares shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent to be
held as part of the Exchange Fund. Subject to applicable Laws, after the surrender of a BYBK Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.5, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of OLB Common Stock represented by such BYBK Certificate.

 
(e)        At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of BYBK shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration or

transfers of shares of BYBK Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Persons who held shares of BYBK Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except with respect to the right to receive the applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration and as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, BYBK Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent
or OLB for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

 
(f)         The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash portion of the Exchange Fund otherwise payable

pursuant to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions hereby to any holder of BYBK Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the BYBK Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
made by the Exchange Agent.

 
(g)        Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed

by the BYBK Common Stockholders for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to OLB. Any BYBK
Common Stockholder who has not theretofore complied with this Section 2.5 shall thereafter be entitled to look only to OLB for payment of the
BYBK Common Stockholder’s share of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of BYBK Common Stock such BYBK
Common Stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 
(h)        No Liability. None of OLB, BYBK or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them,

shall be liable to any Person in respect of any distributions from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any BYBK Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Regulatory
Authority), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of OLB, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto or their successors, assigns or personal representatives.

 
Section 2.6                  Adjustments.
 

(a)        Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event OLB changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the
exchange of, shares of OLB Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding OLB Common Stock, and the record
date therefor or the effective date thereof, as applicable, is prior to the Effective Time, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio
so as to provide the holders of the BYBK Common Stock the same economic benefit as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the Exchange Ratio if (a) OLB issues additional shares of
OLB Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party transaction, (b) OLB issues employee or director stock
grants or similar equity awards in the Ordinary Course, or (c) shares of OLB Common Stock are repurchased by or on behalf of OLB.

(b)        Litigation Adjustment. With respect to the after-tax income recognized, on or after August 4, 2017 and prior to the Effective Time,
by BYBK or Bay Bank from the settlement of the lawsuit captioned Lois F. Lapidus, et al. v. Bay Bank, FSB, No. RDB 16-03260 (the “Lawsuit”), in
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, (i) the value of the Merger Consideration shall be increased by such after-tax income
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio shall be increased by an amount determined by (A) dividing such after-tax income by the number of shares of BYBK
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (B) dividing the amount calculated pursuant to the
foregoing item (A) by the Average Price. Any income or other consideration received from settlement or other resolution of the Lawsuit after the
Effective Date will not be added to the Merger Consideration.

 
Example 2(b): Assume that there are 10,717,889 shares of BYBK Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and

the Average Price is $27.00, such that (i) the Exchange Ratio, prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement, is 0.4370 and (ii) the
Merger Consideration, prior to any adjustment, is 4,683,717.493 shares of OLB Common Stock, with an aggregate value of $126,460,372.311.
Assume further that Bay Bank recognizes after-tax income of $984,750 in connection with the resolution of the Lawsuit prior to the Effective Time.
In such case, (i) the value of the Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), would be increased to $127,445,122.311 and (ii)
the Exchange Ratio, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), would be increased by 0.0034 to 0.4404.

 
(c)        Loan Resolution. In the event and to extent that BYBK or Bay Bank recognizes, on or after August 4, 2017 and prior to the Effective

Time, after-tax income as of a result of a resolution of one or more of the loans listed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 2.6(c) (the “Loan Recovery
Amount”) and such Loan Recovery Amount exceeds the amount listed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 2.6(c) as the “5/31/17 Ledger Balance,” (i) the
value of the Merger Consideration shall be increased by the Loan Recovery Amount (the “Net Loan Recovery Amount”) and (ii) the Exchange Ratio
shall be increased by an amount determined by (A) dividing the Net Loan Recovery Amount by the number of shares of BYBK Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (B) dividing the amount calculated pursuant to the foregoing item (i) by the
Average Price, subject to the following limitations: (1) if the BYBK and Bay Bank net loan and lease charge-offs between August 4, 2017 and the
Effective Date exceeds $226,000, the Net Loan Recovery Amount will be reduced by such excess (the “Charge-off Reduction”); and (2) in no event
will the Charge-off Reduction exceed $500,000. Any income or other consideration received as a result of resolution of one or more of the loans
listed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 2.6(c) after the Effective Date will not be added to the Merger Consideration.

 
Example 2(c): Assume that there are 10,717,889 shares of BYBK Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and

the Average Price is $27.00, such that (i) the Exchange Ratio, prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement, is 0.4370 and (ii) the
Merger Consideration, prior to any adjustment, is 4,683,717.493 shares of OLB Common Stock, with an aggregate value of $126,460,372.311.
Assume further that the resolution of certain loans listed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 2.6(c) results in a Loan Recovery Amount of $750,000, and
the amount of Bay Bank’s net loan and lease charge-offs recognized prior to the Effective Time is equal to $275,000. In such case, (i) the Charge-Off
Reduction would be $49,000, (ii) the adjusted Net Loan Recovery Amount would be $701,000, (iii) the value of the Merger Consideration, as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.6(c), would be increased to $127,161,372.311, and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, as adjusted pursuant to this Section
2.6(c), would be increased by 0.0024 to 0.4394.

 
Combined Example: Assume that all of the facts and circumstances set forth in Example 2(b) and Example 2(c) were to occur. In such case,

(i) the value of the Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and Section 2.6(c), would be increased to $128,146,122.311 and (ii)
the Exchange Ratio, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and Section 2.6(c), would be increased by 0.0058 to 0.4428.

Section 2.7                  Other Matters.
 

Nothing set forth in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement shall be construed to:
 
(a)        Preclude any of the OLB Companies from acquiring or assuming, or to limit in any way the right of any of the OLB Companies to

acquire or assume, prior to or following the Effective Date, the stock, assets or liabilities of any financial services institution or Entity other than
BYBK or Bay Bank, whether for cash or by issuance or exchange of OLB Common Stock or any securities convertible into shares of OLB Common
Stock, unless such transaction would result in a Material Adverse Effect on OLB;

 
(b)        Preclude OLB from issuing, or to limit in any way the right of OLB to issue, OLB Common Stock or other securities in a

transaction(s) other than the Contemplated Transactions;
 
(c)        Preclude OLB from granting employee, director or compensatory options at any time with respect to OLB Common Stock or other

securities in the Ordinary Course;
 
(d)        Preclude option holders or equity compensation plan participants of OLB from exercising options at any time with respect to OLB

Common Stock or other securities; or
 
(e)        Preclude any of the OLB Companies from taking, or to limit in any way the right of any of them to take, any other action not

expressly and specifically prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
 
Provided, however, that OLB shall not take, or permit any OLB Company to take, any of the foregoing actions pursuant to this Section 2.7 if

doing so would impair the ability of OLB to perform its obligations under this Agreement and/or consummate the Contemplated Transactions as and
when otherwise required by this Agreement.

 
ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BYBK
 

BYBK represents and warrants to OLB, for itself and with respect to and on behalf of each of the BYBK Subsidiaries (to the extent
applicable), that the statements contained in this Article III (and as reflected on the BYBK Disclosure Schedules) are true and correct as of the date of
this Agreement and will be true and correct as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as though the Closing Date were substituted for the date
of this Agreement throughout this Article III, except that those representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of the date of this
Agreement or some other date shall be true and correct as of such date); provided, however, that no representation or warranty of BYBK contained in
this Article III shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and BYBK shall not be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence
of the existence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts,
circumstances or events inconsistent with any paragraph of Article III, has had or is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
BYBK, disregarding for these purposes (i) any qualification or exception for, or reference to, materiality in any such representation or warranty and
(ii) any use of the terms “material,” “materially,” “in all material respects,” “Material Adverse Effect” or similar terms or phrases in any such
representation or warranty; provided, however, that the foregoing standard shall not apply to representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1,
3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.14, 3.18, 3.27, 3.32 and 3.41, which shall be deemed untrue, incorrect and breached if they are not true and correct in all material
respects (the “Article III Standard”).

 
BYBK has made a good faith effort to ensure that the disclosure on each schedule of the BYBK Disclosure Schedules corresponds to the section
referenced herein. For purposes of the BYBK Disclosure Schedules, however, any item disclosed on any schedule therein is deemed to be fully
disclosed with respect to all schedules under which such item may be relevant as and to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such

and all material notices and claims thereunder have been filed in a due and timely fashion. BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.9(d) identifies all Insurance
Policies maintained by the BYBK Companies.

 
(e)        None of the BYBK Companies has received notice from any insurance carrier that:
 

(i)                   Any of its Insurance Policies will be cancelled, terminated or not renewed or that coverage thereunder will be
reduced or eliminated; or

(f)         Except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.9(f), there are presently no material claims pending under such Insurance
Policies and none of the BYBK Companies has received any notices under such Insurance Policies. All such Insurance Policies are valid and

which it has applied and, during such periods, it has not been denied indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its Insurance
Policies.

its business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with its employees conducting such business, except where noncompliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

 
(b)        Each of the BYBK Companies has, and since December 31, 2012, has had, all material permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and

approvals of all Regulatory Authorities that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its properties and carry on its business as it is presently
conducted, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith; all such permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and

Knowledge of BYBK no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result from the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, subject to obtaining the receipt of all requisite approvals or consents from the Regulatory
Authorities in order to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. None of the BYBK Companies is in default or violation of any such permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals. None of the BYBK Companies have been given notice or been charged with any violation of any Law
or condition to approval of any Regulatory Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect;

Section 3.13               ERISA.
 

(a)        BYBK has set forth in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a) a complete and accurate list of the BYBK Benefit Plans and made
available to OLB a copy of all available written documents regarding such BYBK Benefit Plans including:

 
(i)                   A copy of each of the BYBK Benefit Plans and any related trust agreements or other funding arrangements;
 
(ii)                 The most recent actuarial reports (if any) and financial reports it has received relating to the BYBK Benefit Plans that

constitute “qualified pension plans” under IRC Section 401(a);
 
(iii)                The most recently filed Form 5500, together with schedules and attachments, as required (if any) relating to the

BYBK Benefit Plans that have been filed with the United States Department of Labor;
 
(iv)               The most recent favorable determination letters (or opinion letter for a prototype plan) issued by the IRS that pertain

to any of the BYBK Benefit Plans that are “qualified pension plans” under IRC Section 401(a); and
 
(v)                 Summary plan descriptions and any amendments or material modifications thereto and any insurance, third party

administrator or administrative services only Contracts related to the BYBK Benefit Plans within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(1) or
3(2).

 
(b)        The BYBK Companies have paid in full any insurance premiums due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) with

respect to any defined benefit pension plans for the six years prior to, and through, the Effective Date. Except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure
Schedule 3.13(b), no pension plan (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2)) maintained or contributed to by any of the BYBK Companies has
been terminated or is under notice from the PBGC of any threat of termination under the procedures of the PBGC. To the Knowledge of BYBK, no
circumstance has occurred for which any reportable event under ERISA Section 4043(b) has been or would be required that has not been reported or
with respect to which the notice requirement has not been waived. Except as set forth on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.13(b), no BYBK Benefit Plan
is subject to IRC Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA, and as of the Effective Date, to the Knowledge of BYBK, no condition exists that will present a
material risk to OLB of incurring any liability to the PBGC or on account of the failure to comply with any such provisions in connection with any
such BYBK Benefit Plan. Except pursuant to Contracts relating to employment disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.8 or as disclosed in BYBK
Disclosure Schedule 3.13(b), no BYBK Benefit Plan provides, and none of the BYBK Companies has any obligation to provide, health or welfare
benefits to any individual following termination of such individual’s employment or service with it or an Affiliate (other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended or any similar state law).

 
(c)        To the Knowledge of BYBK, none of the BYBK Companies has ever contributed to, or otherwise incurred, any liability with respect

to a multi-employer plan (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)).
 
(d)        Each BYBK Benefit Plan complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the IRC, the Patient

Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and any other applicable Laws governing the BYBK Benefit Plan, and each BYBK Benefit Plan has at
all times been administered in all material respects in accordance with all requirements of applicable Law and in accordance with its terms. Each
pension plan adopted by the BYBK Companies that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC is so qualified, and, to the Knowledge
of BYBK, each trust established by each pension plan is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the IRC. Each of the pension plans
adopted by the BYBK Companies is, and from its establishment has been, exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the IRC. Each of
the pension plans adopted by the BYBK Companies has received, or is entitled to rely upon, a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter for a
prototype plan) from the IRS, and to the Knowledge of BYBK there are no circumstances that will or could result in revocation of, or inability to
continue to rely upon, any such favorable determination letter or opinion letter. No Litigation (other than routine claims for benefits) has been filed, is
pending or, to the Knowledge of BYBK, is threatened, with respect to any BYBK Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of BYBK, there is no fact or
contemplated event that would give rise to any Litigation (other than routine claims for benefits) with respect to any BYBK Benefit Plan. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of BYBK, the following are true:

(i)                   Each BYBK Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan subject to IRC Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA as
of the most recent actuarial valuation has an AFTAP determined under IRC Section 430 and 436 that exceeds the AFTAP level that would
impose any funding-based limit on such plan under IRC Section 436;

 
(ii)                 Each BYBK Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution pension plan that is intended to be qualified under IRC

Section 401(a) has had all contributions made to the plan trust in accordance with the terms of the plan on a timely basis under the IRC and
ERISA;

 
(iii)                With respect to each BYBK Benefit Plan, to the Knowledge of BYBK there is no occurrence or Contract that would

constitute any “prohibited transaction” within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the IRC or Section 406 of ERISA, which transaction is not
exempt under applicable Law, including Section 4975(d) of the IRC or Section 408 of ERISA;

 
(iv)               Except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.13(d)(iv), no BYBK Benefit Plan is an Employee Stock

(v)                 No BYBK Benefit Plan is a Qualified Foreign Plan as the term is defined in Section 404A of the IRC and no BYBK

Benefit Plan or any related trust assets or agreements are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America or
any state, county or municipality of the United States;

 
(vi)               None of the welfare plans adopted by the BYBK Companies is a Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association as

defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the IRC;

and have been administered in substantial compliance with (A) Section 4980B of the IRC and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA and all
U.S. Department of the Treasury and U.S. Department of Labor regulations issued thereunder, respectively, (B) the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (C) the applicable provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and (D)
the U.S. Department of Labor regulations issued with respect to such welfare benefit plans; and

 
(viii)            With respect to each BYBK Benefit Plan, BYBK or any BYBK ERISA Affiliate has the authority to amend or

terminate such BYBK Benefit Plan at any time, subject to the applicable requirements of ERISA and the IRC and the provisions of the
BYBK Benefit Plan.

 
(e)        There is no existing or, to the Knowledge of BYBK, contemplated, audit of any BYBK Benefit Plan by the IRS, the U.S.

Department of Labor, the PBGC, any Regulatory Authority or any other governmental authority. In addition, there is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of BYBK, threatened Litigation by, on behalf of or with respect to any BYBK Benefit Plan, or by or on behalf of any individual
participant or beneficiary of any BYBK Benefit Plan, alleging any violation of ERISA or any other applicable Laws, or claiming benefits (other than
claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course), nor, to the Knowledge of BYBK, is there any basis likely to enable such Litigation to prevail.

 
(f)         Except as disclosed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.13(f), (i) no payment contemplated or required by or under any BYBK Benefit

Plan and employment-related agreement would in the aggregate constitute excess parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the IRC
(without regard to subsection (b)(4) thereof), (ii) no BYBK Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of taxes under Sections 280G,
4999 or 409A of the IRC, and (iii) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of Contemplated Transactions will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of any of the BYBK Companies.

(h)        None of the BYBK Companies is a record-keeper, administrator, custodian, fiduciary, trustee or otherwise acts on behalf of any

plan, program or arrangement subject to ERISA (other than any BYBK Benefit Plan).
 

Section 3.14               Brokers and Finders.
 

Other than the BYBK Advisers, none of the BYBK Companies and, to the Knowledge of BYBK, no officer, director, employee,
independent contractor, agent or Affiliate of any BYBK Company on its behalf, has employed any broker, finder, investment banker or financial
advisor, or incurred any liability for any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, investment banker or financial advisor, in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions

 
Section 3.15               Real Property and Leases.
 

(a)        BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.15(a) contains a true, correct and complete list of all street addresses and fee owners of all real
property owned, leased or operated by the BYBK Companies or otherwise occupied by a BYBK Company or used or held for use by any BYBK
Company, including but not limited to all REO (the “BYBK Real Property”). Other than as set forth on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.15(a), there are
no Persons in possession of any portion of any of the BYBK Real Property owned or leased by any BYBK Company other than such BYBK
Company, and no Person other than a BYBK Company has the right to use or occupy for any purpose any portion of any of the BYBK Real Property
owned, leased or licensed by a BYBK Company. BYBK and the BYBK Subsidiaries own or lease all properties as are necessary to their operations
as now conducted. True, correct and complete copies of all deeds, surveys, title insurance policies and leases for the properties listed on BYBK
Disclosure Schedule 3.15(a), and of all mortgages, deeds of trust and security agreements to which such properties are subject, have been made
available to OLB to the extent BYBK possesses such deeds, surveys, title insurance policies, leases, mortgages, deeds of trust and security
agreements. There are no outstanding options, rights of first offer or refusal or other pre-emptive rights or purchase rights with respect to any BYBK
Real Property owned by a BYBK Company, or any portion thereof.

 
(b)        Except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.15(b), no lease with respect to any BYBK Real Property and no deed with

respect to any BYBK Real Property contains any restrictive covenant that materially restricts the use, transferability or value of such BYBK Real
Property. Each lease with respect to any BYBK Real Property is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and is in full force and effect. There are no
existing defaults by the BYBK Companies or, to the Knowledge of BYBK, the other party, under any lease with respect to any BYBK Real Property
and, to the Knowledge of BYBK, there are no allegations or assertions of such defaults by any party under any lease with respect to any BYBK Real
Property or any events that, with notice or lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other event, would constitute a default under any lease
with respect to any BYBK Real Property, except where the existence of such defaults, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is not
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 
(c)        To the Knowledge of BYBK, none of the buildings and structures located on any BYBK Real Property, nor any improvements or

appurtenances thereto or equipment therein, nor the operation or maintenance thereof, violates in any material manner any land use Laws or
restrictive covenants, or encroaches on any property owned by others, nor does any building or structure of third parties encroach upon any BYBK
Real Property, except for those violations and encroachments that in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.15(c), no condemnation or eminent domain proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge
of BYBK, threatened, that would preclude or materially impair the use of any BYBK Real Property in the manner in which it is currently being used.

(d)     The BYBK Companies have a valid and enforceable leasehold interest in or, to the Knowledge of BYBK, based on title insurance
owned by it, good and marketable title to, all BYBK Real Property and all improvements thereon, subject to no Liens of any kind except (i) as noted
in the BYBK Financials, (ii) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due or that are being contested in good faith, (iii) minor defects and
irregularities in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held, (iv) mechanics liens for
amounts not yet due or that are being contested in good faith, and (v) those assets and properties disposed of for fair market value in the Ordinary
Course since the date of the BYBK Financials. All BYBK Real Property used in the business of the BYBK Companies is in adequate condition
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and, to the Knowledge of BYBK, is free from defects that could materially interfere with the current or intended
future use of such facilities, provided such future use is substantially similar to its current use.

 
(e)        Except as listed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.15(e), there are no Contracts to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any of the

BYBK Real Property.
 

Section 3.16               Environmental Matters.
 

With respect to BYBK and each BYBK Subsidiary:
 
(a)        Neither the conduct nor operation of its business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or operated by it

(including REO) results or resulted in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a material liability (including a
material remediation obligation) upon BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of BYBK, no condition has existed or event has occurred
with respect to any of them or any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any material liability

(a)           BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.17(a) sets forth a complete and correct list of all trademarks, trade dress, trade names, service
marks, service names, brand names, domain names, logos, patents, technology, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, works of authorship
and other intellectual property rights used in the conduct of the existing business of each of the BYBK Companies for use in its business, and all
registrations, applications, technology rights, licenses or other Contracts relating thereto and all Contracts relating to third party intellectual property
that it is licensed or authorized to use in its business, including without limitation any software licenses (collectively, the “BYBK Intellectual
Property”) other than “shrink wrap,” “click wrap” or “browser wrap” licenses, free licenses, open source licenses or force placed software licenses.
To the Knowledge of BYBK, each of the BYBK Companies owns or possesses valid, binding and assignable licenses and other rights to use without
payment (other than as set forth in the applicable license) all BYBK Intellectual Property that is used in the conduct of its existing businesses free
and clear of all Liens (other than BYBK Permitted Liens) and any claims of ownership by current or former employees or contractors, other than
royalties or payments with respect to off-the-shelf software. With respect to each item of BYBK Intellectual Property that any of the BYBK
Companies is licensed or authorized to use, the license, sublicense or Contract covering such item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full
force and effect, and no BYBK Company is in default under or violation of any of its material BYBK Intellectual Property licenses. To the
Knowledge of BYBK, none of the BYBK Companies is infringing, diluting, misappropriating or violating the intellectual property of any other
Person, and, except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.17(a), none of the BYBK Companies has received any communications alleging
that it has infringed, diluted, misappropriated or violated any such intellectual property. Except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.17(a),
none of the BYBK Companies has sent any communications alleging that any Person has infringed, diluted, misappropriated or violated any BYBK
Intellectual Property and, to the Knowledge of BYBK, no Person is infringing, diluting, misappropriating or violating any of the BYBK Intellectual
Property. Subject to any trademark filings required by Law in connection with the Merger, the validity, continuation and effectiveness of all licenses
and other Contracts relating to material BYBK Intellectual Property used by any BYBK Company in the Ordinary Course and the current terms
thereof will not be affected by the Contemplated Transactions, the use of all material Intellectual Property of each of the BYBK Companies’
trademarks will be transferred to OLB in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and after the Effective Time, no Person besides OLB shall
have right and title to the “Bay Bank” or “Bay Bancorp, Inc.” trade names and trademarks when used in connection with the BYBK Companies’
currently-offered goods and services in the territories in which they currently operate. For the avoidance of doubt, all third-party rights used by any of
the BYBK Companies pursuant to software licenses that are not required to be listed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.17(a) are nevertheless within
the definition of “BYBK Intellectual Property.”

 
(b)           Each of the BYBK Companies has taken commercially reasonable actions to protect and maintain (a) all material BYBK

Intellectual Property and (b) the security and integrity of its software, databases, networks, systems, equipment and hardware and to protect the same
against unauthorized use, modification or access thereto, or the introduction of any disabling codes or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms,
viruses or other software or elements that permit or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption, impairment, disablement or destruction of, software,
data or other materials. To the Knowledge of BYBK, the computers, computer software, other information technology equipment, information
technology passwords and other credentials, and all associated documents and records owned or leased by the BYBK Companies (the “BYBK IT
Assets”), operate and perform in all material respects in accordance with their documentation and functional specifications as required by them in
connection with their business, and none of the BYBK IT Assets has materially malfunctioned or failed to meet its requirements within the past two
years except for such malfunctions or failures that have been remediated. To the Knowledge of BYBK, except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure
Schedule 3.17(b), no Person has gained unauthorized access to the BYBK IT Assets. Each of the BYBK Companies has implemented commercially
reasonable backup and disaster recovery policies, procedures, systems and technology consistent with industry practices for financial institutions of
comparable size and complexity, and sufficient to reasonably maintain the operation of the respective businesses of BYBK and each of the BYBK
Subsidiaries in all material respects.

 
(c)           BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.17(c) sets forth a complete and correct list of all Persons, other than directors, officers and

employees of the BYBK Companies, who have access to any of the BYBK IT Assets.

Section 3.19               Related Party Transactions.

Financials, and/or as disclosed in the BYBK SEC Reports, neither BYBK nor any BYBK Subsidiary is a party to any transaction (including any loan

transactions (i) were made in the Ordinary Course, (ii) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with Persons who are not related to or Affiliates of BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary, and (iii) did
not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

 
(b)        Except as set forth in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.19, as of the date hereof, no Credit Extension by any of the BYBK Companies

to any BYBK Subsidiary or Affiliate of BYBK is presently in material default or, during the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement, has
been in material default or has been restructured, modified or extended in order to avoid or cure a default, except for rate modifications pursuant to
its loan modification policy that is applicable to all Persons. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of BYBK, principal and interest with respect to
any such Credit Extension will be paid when due and the loan grade classification accorded such Credit Extension is appropriate.

 
Section 3.20               Loans.
 

(a)        Except as disclosed in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.20(a), all Credit Extensions reflected as assets in the BYBK Financials or
currently outstanding that will be reflected as assets in the BYBK Financials arose out of bona fide arm’s-length transactions, were made for good
and valuable consideration in the Ordinary Course, and are being transferred to OLB and/or Old Line with good and marketable title, free and clear
of any and all Liens, and are evidenced by notes, Contracts or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine, correct and what they purport to
be, and to the extent secured, are secured by valid Liens that are legal, valid and binding obligations of the maker thereof, enforceable in accordance
with the respective terms thereof, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or equitable principles affecting the enforcement
of creditors’ rights that have been perfected or (ii) the pledge of any Credit Extension to the FHLB as collateral to secure the performance by the
BYBK Companies of all obligations owed thereto. All Credit Extensions reflected, or currently outstanding that will be reflected, as assets in the
BYBK Financials were made in accordance in all material respects with sound banking practices, and to the Knowledge of BYBK, are not subject to
any defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, including without limitation any such as are afforded by usury or truth in lending Laws, except as may be
provided by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally or by general principles of equity. The notes or other credit or security documents with respect to each such outstanding
Credit Extension were in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of origination or purchase by any BYBK Company
and are complete and correct in all material respects.

(b)        To the Knowledge of BYBK, neither the terms of any Credit Extension by any of the BYBK Companies, any of the documentation
for any such Credit Extension, the manner in which any such Credit Extension has been administered and serviced, nor the practices of approving or
rejecting applications for a Credit Extension by the BYBK Companies, violate in any material respect any Law applicable thereto, including, without
limitation, the Truth In Lending Act and the CFPB’s Regulation Z, the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and any Laws relating to consumer
protection, installment sales and usury.

 
(c)        Except as disclosed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.20(c), none of the Contracts pursuant to which any of the BYBK Companies

has sold Credit Extensions or pools of Credit Extensions or participations in Credit Extensions or pools of Credit Extensions contains any obligation
to repurchase such Credit Extensions or interests therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Credit Extension. Except
as would not be material to the BYBK Companies as a whole, each Credit Extension included in a pool of Credit Extensions originated, securitized
or, to the Knowledge of BYBK, acquired by any BYBK Company (a “Pool”) meets all eligibility requirements (including all applicable requirements
for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion in such Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or,
if required, recertified in accordance with all applicable Laws, except where the time for certification or recertification has not yet expired. No Pools
have been improperly certified and, except as would not be material to BYBK and the BYBK Companies taken as a whole, no Credit Extension has
been bought out of a Pool without all required approvals of the applicable investors.

 
(d)        BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.20(d) sets forth a list of all Credit Extensions as of the date hereof by BYBK or Bay Bank to any

directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (as such terms are defined in the FRB’s Regulation O) of any of the BYBK Companies. There
are no employee, officer, director or other insider Credit Extensions by any of the BYBK Companies on which the borrower is paying a rate other
than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate that was not in compliance with
Regulation O and all such Credit Extensions are and were originated in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

Section 3.21               Allowance for Loan Losses.
 

The allowance for loan losses reflected in reports by the BYBK Companies to each Regulatory Authority has been and will be established in
compliance with the requirements of all regulatory criteria, and the allowance for loan losses shown in the BYBK Financials has been and will be
established and maintained in accordance with GAAP and applicable Law and in a manner consistent with Bay Bank’s internal policies. The
allowance for loan losses reflected in such reports and the allowance for loan losses shown in the BYBK Financials, in the opinion of management,
was or will be adequate as of the dates thereof. BYBK has disclosed to OLB on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.21 all Credit Extensions (including
participations) by and all interest-bearing assets of the BYBK Companies (a) that have been accelerated during the past 12 months, (b) that have been
terminated during the past 12 months by reason of a default or adverse development in the condition of the borrower or other events or circumstances

interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to pay in accordance with such initial terms, (i) where a specific reserve allocation exists in
connection therewith, (j) that are required to be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 15, (k) that were made pursuant to an exception to policy, and (l) that, to the extent not already disclosed pursuant to the foregoing
items (a) through (k), have been charged-off at any time since January 1, 2014, together with true, complete and materially correct copies of reports

supplied OLB with a copy of Bay Bank’s current CRA Statement, all letters and written comments received by Bay Bank since September 16, 2016
pertaining thereto and any responses by Bay Bank to such comments. Bay Bank has a rating of “satisfactory” or better as of its most recent CRA
compliance examination and BYBK and Bay Bank have received no communication from any Regulatory Authority that would lead BYBK to
believe that Bay Bank will not receive a rating of “satisfactory” or better pursuant to its next CRA compliance examination or that any Regulatory
Authority would seek to restrain, delay or prohibit any of the Contemplated Transactions as a result of any act or omission of Bay Bank under the
CRA.

 
Section 3.23               Anti-Money Laundering; OFAC; Sanctions; and Information Security.
 

(a)        To the Knowledge of BYBK, there do not exist any facts or circumstances that would cause any of the BYBK Companies: (i) to be
deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any Order issued with respect to anti-
money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”),
or any other applicable anti-money laundering Law, as well as the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program adopted by the
BYBK Companies; or (ii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy of customer
information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy Laws, including without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of
1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by the BYBK Companies.
To the Knowledge of BYBK, no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that
would cause any of the BYBK Companies to undertake any remedial action. The board of directors or other governing body of each BYBK
Company that is subject to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder has adopted, and each such BYBK Company has
implemented, a Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification
procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder and such Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
laundering program meets the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and it
has not received written notice from any Regulatory Authority that such program (A) does not contain adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures, or (B) has been deemed ineffective. Each of the BYBK Companies has complied in all material respects with
any requirements to file reports and other necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

 
(b)        No BYBK Company or, to the Knowledge of BYBK, any director, officer, agent, employee, Affiliate or other Person on behalf of

Kingdom’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (Her Majesty’s Treasury), or other relevant sanctions authority (collectively, “Sanctions ”),

defined in Section 14-3504(a) of the Commercial Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (the “Commercial Law Article”) with respect to
personal information maintained by any of the BYBK Companies, without regard to the application of Section 14-3507(b) of the Commercial Law

transmission, transfer, disclosure, destruction and use of personally identifiable information and (ii) taken commercially reasonable measures to
ensure that all personally identifiable information in its possession or control is reasonably protected against loss, damage and unauthorized access,
use, modification or other misuse. To BYBK’s Knowledge, there has been no loss, damage or unauthorized access, use, modification or other misuse
of any such information by BYBK, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person.

accurate record of all actions of their respective stockholders and boards of directors (and any committees thereof) and have been maintained in
accordance with applicable Law. All personnel files, reports, feasibility studies, environmental assessments and reports, strategic planning
documents, financial forecasts, deeds, leases, lease files, land files, accounting and tax records and all other records that relate to the business and
properties of the BYBK Companies that have been requested by OLB have been made available to OLB, its Representatives or its Affiliates, and are
located at the offices of the BYBK Companies at 7151 Columbia Gateway Drive, Suite A, Columbia, Maryland 21046.

 
(b)        BYBK maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the

Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions by or with the BYBK Companies are executed in accordance with
management’s general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions by or with the BYBK Companies are recorded as necessary (A) to permit the
preparation of financial statements and reports filed with any Regulatory Authority in conformity with GAAP consistently applied and any other
criteria applicable to such statements, and (B) to maintain accountability for assets and liabilities; (iii) access to the assets of, and the incurrence of
liabilities by, the BYBK Companies is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations; (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets and liabilities of the BYBK Companies is compared with existing assets and liabilities of the BYBK Companies at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences; and (v) extensions of credit by and other receivables of the
BYBK Companies are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. Except as disclosed in the BYBK SEC Reports or on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.25(b), since December 31, 2012, neither BYBK nor,
to BYBK’s Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or representative of any BYBK Company, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the adequacy of BYBK’s internal control over financial
reporting or integrity of the BYBK Financials or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect
to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of BYBK or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that BYBK or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices. To the Knowledge of BYBK there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal control
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect BYBK’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. To the Knowledge of BYBK, except as disclosed on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.25(b), there has occurred no fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in BYBK’s internal control over financial reporting.

waivers or approvals required from, any Regulatory Authority, or (b) cause a Regulatory Authority acting pursuant to applicable Law to seek to
prohibit or materially delay consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or impose a Burdensome Condition.

applicable accounting and regulatory requirements and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, except for (i) omission of
the notes from the financial statements, applicable to any interim period, and (ii) with respect to any interim period, normal year-end adjustments and

(b)        OLB did not, as of the date of the OLB Financials or any subsequent date, have any liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies of

any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, that are not fully reflected or reserved against in the balance sheets included in the
OLB Financials at the date of such balance sheets that would have been required to be reflected therein in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied or fully disclosed in a note thereto, except for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies that are not material in the aggregate and that are
incurred in the Ordinary Course, and except for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies that are within the subject matter of a specific
representation and warranty herein or that have not had a Material Adverse Effect and subject, in the case of any unaudited statements, to normal
recurring audit adjustments and the absence of notes thereto.

 
(c)        During the periods covered by the OLB Financials with respect to periods ended prior to the date of this Agreement, OLB’s

Neither OLB nor any OLB Subsidiary has suffered any adverse change in its assets (including loan portfolio), liabilities (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise), liquidity, net worth, property, financial condition or results of operations, or any damage, destruction or loss,
whether or not covered by insurance, since June 30, 2017, that in the aggregate has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the OLB Companies taken as a whole.

Taxing Authority by, or on behalf of, each of the OLB Companies have been filed on a timely basis in accordance with all applicable Laws, and such
OLB Returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects, or requests for extensions to file the OLB Returns have been timely filed, granted
and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to file, to be complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain in effect
individually or in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on OLB. All OLB Taxes shown to be due and payable on the OLB Returns
or on subsequent assessments with respect thereto have been paid in full or adequate reserves have been established in the OLB Financials for the
payment of such OLB Taxes, except where any such failure to pay or establish adequate reserves, in the aggregate, has not had, and is not reasonably
likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the OLB Companies. Each of the OLB Companies has timely withheld and paid over all OLB Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid over by it, and complied with all information reporting and backup withholding requirements, including
maintenance of required records with respect thereto, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor or

Persons, each of the OLB Companies has the right under valid, binding and existing leases to use such real and personal property in all material

accurate statements on any insurance renewal application. Each such Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and, except for Insurance Policies
insuring against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of OLB and the OLB Subsidiaries, OLB or the relevant OLB Subsidiary is
the sole beneficiary of such Insurance Policies. All premiums and other payments due under such Insurance Policies have been paid, and all material

connection therewith, and each of such reports, forms, filings, etc. were complete and accurate in all material respects and complied in all material
respects with all Laws under which it was filed (or was amended so as to be in compliance promptly following discovery of such noncompliance)

accounting principles and practices and, in the case of the OLB SEC reports, GAAP, throughout the periods covered by such filing, except to the
extent failure to timely file would not, individually or in the aggregate, be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; none of the OLB Reports
when filed with the SEC (the “OLB SEC Reports”), and if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; there (i) is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory Authority
with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations, inspections or investigations of OLB or any OLB Subsidiary (not including any

There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements to which any of the OLB Companies is a party. There is no union organizing effort
pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB, threatened, against any of the OLB Companies or involving employees of any of the OLB Companies. There
is no labor strike or labor dispute (other than routine employee grievances that are not related to union employees), work slowdown, stoppage,
lockout or other job action pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB, threatened, against any of the OLB Companies. No Litigation asserting that any of
the OLB Companies has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 or comparable state
law) or other violation of state or federal labor Law or seeking to compel any of the OLB Companies to bargain with any labor organization or other
employee representative as to wages or conditions of employment is pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB, threatened, with respect to any of the
OLB Companies before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Regulatory Authority
(other than routine employee grievances that are not related to union employees). Each of the OLB Companies is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and
is not engaged in any unfair labor practice. Except as described in OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.12, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB,
threatened, Litigation against any of the OLB Companies under any applicable labor or employment Law or brought or made by a current or former
employee or applicant for employment.

 
Section 4.13               ERISA.
 

(a)        OLB has set forth in OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.13(a) a complete and accurate list of the OLB Benefit Plans and made available to
BYBK a copy of all available written documents regarding such OLB Benefit Plans.

 
(b)        The OLB Companies have paid in full any insurance premiums due to the PBGC with respect to any defined benefit pension plans

for the six years prior to, and through, the Effective Date. Except as disclosed in OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.13(b), no pension plan (within the
meaning of ERISA Section 3(2)) maintained or contributed to by any of the OLB Companies has been terminated or is under notice from the PBGC
of any threat of termination under the procedures of the PBGC. To the Knowledge of OLB, no circumstance has occurred for which any reportable
event under ERISA Section 4043(b) has been or would be required that has not been reported or with respect to which the notice requirement has not
been waived. Except as set forth on OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.13(b), no OLB Benefit Plan is subject to IRC Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA, and
as of the Effective Date, to the Knowledge of OLB, no condition exists that will result in any liability to the PBGC or on account of the failure to
comply with any such provisions in connection with any such OLB Benefit Plan.

 
(c)        To the Knowledge of OLB, none of the OLB Companies has ever contributed to, or otherwise incurred any liability with respect to,

a multi-employer plan (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)).
 
(d)        Each OLB Benefit Plan complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the IRC, the Patient Protection

and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and any other applicable Laws governing the OLB Benefit Plan, and each OLB Benefit Plan has at all times been
administered substantially in all material respects in accordance with all requirements of applicable Law. To the Knowledge of OLB, each of the
pension plans adopted by the OLB Companies that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC and, to the Knowledge of OLB, its
trust, is exempt from federal income tax under IRC Section 501(a) has received, or is entitled to rely upon, a favorable determination letter (or
opinion letter for a prototype plan) from the IRS, and to the Knowledge of OLB there are no circumstances that will or could result in revocation of,
or inability to continue to rely upon, any such favorable determination letter or opinion letter. Without limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of
OLB, the following are true:

 
(i)                   Each OLB Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan subject to IRC Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA as of

the most recent actuarial valuation has an AFTAP determined under IRC Section 430 and 436 that exceeds the AFTAP level that would
impose any funding-based limit on such plan under IRC Section 436;

 
(ii)                 Each OLB Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution pension plan that is intended to be qualified under IRC Section

401(a) has had all contributions made to the plan trust in accordance with the terms of the plan on a timely basis under the IRC and ERISA;
 
(iii)                With respect to each OLB Benefit Plan, to the Knowledge of OLB there is no occurrence or Contract that would

constitute any “prohibited transaction” within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the IRC or Section 406 of ERISA, which transaction is not
exempt under applicable Law, including Section 4975(d) of the IRC or Section 408 of ERISA;

(iv)               Except as disclosed in OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.13(d)(iv), no OLB Benefit Plan is an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the IRC;

 
(v)                 No OLB Benefit Plan is a Qualified Foreign Plan as the term is defined in Section 404A of the IRC and no OLB

Benefit Plan or any related trust assets or agreements are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America or
any state, county or municipality of the United States;

 
(vi)               None of the welfare plans adopted by the OLB Companies is a Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association as

defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the IRC;
 
(vii)              All of the welfare plans adopted by the OLB Companies and their related trusts comply in all material respects with

and have been administered in substantial compliance with (A) Section 4980B of the IRC and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA and all
U.S. Department of the Treasury and U.S. Department of Labor regulations issued thereunder, respectively, (B) the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (C) the applicable provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and (D)
the U.S. Department of Labor regulations issued with respect to such welfare benefit plans; and

 
(viii)            With respect to each OLB Benefit Plan, OLB or any OLB ERISA Affiliate has the authority to amend or terminate

such OLB Benefit Plan at any time, subject to the applicable requirements of ERISA and the IRC and the provisions of the OLB Benefit
Plan.

 
(e)        There is no existing or, to the Knowledge of OLB, contemplated, audit of any OLB Benefit Plan by the IRS, the U.S. Department of

Labor, the PBGC, any Regulatory Authority or any other governmental authority. In addition, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB,
threatened material Litigation by, on behalf of or with respect to any OLB Benefit Plan, or by or on behalf of any individual participant or beneficiary
of any OLB Benefit Plan, alleging any violation of ERISA or any other applicable Laws, or claiming benefits (other than claims for benefits made in
the Ordinary Course), nor, to the Knowledge of OLB, is there any basis likely to enable such Litigation to prevail.

 
(f)         Except as disclosed on OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.13(f), (i) no payment contemplated or required by or under any OLB Benefit

Plan and employment-related agreement would in the aggregate constitute excess parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the IRC
(without regard to subsection (b)(4) thereof), (ii) no OLB Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of taxes under Sections 280G,
4999 or 409A of the IRC, and (iii) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of Contemplated Transactions will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of any of the OLB Companies.

 
(g)        None of the OLB Companies is a record-keeper, administrator, custodian, fiduciary, trustee or otherwise acts on behalf of any plan,

program, or arrangement subject to ERISA (other than any OLB Benefit Plan). Each OLB Benefit Plan (including employment Contracts or other
compensation arrangements) that constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the IRC has been
written, executed and operated in compliance with Section 409A of the IRC and the regulations thereunder or an applicable exemption therefrom.

 
Section 4.14               Brokers and Finders.
 
Other than Fig Partners, LLC, none of the OLB Companies and, to the Knowledge of OLB, no officer, director, employee, independent contractor,
agent or Affiliate of any OLB Company on its behalf, has employed any broker, finder, investment banker or financial advisor, or incurred any
liability for any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, investment banker or financial advisor, in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 4.15               Real Property and Leases.
 

(a)        OLB and the OLB Subsidiaries own or lease all properties as are necessary to their operations as now conducted. No deed or lease
with respect to any real property owned, leased or operated by the OLB Companies, including but not limited to all REO (the “OLB Real Property”)
contains any restrictive covenant that materially restricts the use, transferability or value of such OLB Real Property. Each lease with respect to any
OLB Real Property is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights
generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and is in full force and effect. There are no existing defaults by the OLB Companies or, to the
Knowledge of OLB, the other party, under any lease with respect to any OLB Real Property and, to the Knowledge of OLB, there are no allegations
or assertions of such defaults by any party under any lease with respect to any OLB Real Property or any events that, with notice or lapse of time or
the happening or occurrence of any other event, would constitute a default under any lease with respect to any OLB Real Property, except where the
existence of such defaults, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is not reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 
(b)        To the Knowledge of OLB, none of the buildings and structures located on any OLB Real Property, nor any improvements or

appurtenances thereto or equipment therein, nor the operation or maintenance thereof, violates in any material manner any land use Laws or
restrictive covenants, except for those violations and encroachments that in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No condemnation or eminent domain proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB, threatened, that would preclude or
materially impair the use of any OLB Real Property in the manner in which it is currently being used.

 
(c)        The OLB Companies have a valid and enforceable leasehold interest in or, to the Knowledge of OLB, based on title insurance

owned by it, good and marketable title to, all OLB Real Property and all improvements thereon, subject to no Liens of any kind except (i) as noted in
the OLB Financials, (ii) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due or that are being contested in good faith, (iii) minor defects and irregularities
in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held, (iv) mechanics liens for amounts not
yet due or that are being contested in good faith, and (v) those assets and properties disposed of for fair market value in the Ordinary Course since the
date of the OLB Financials. To the Knowledge of OLB, all OLB Real Property used in the business of the OLB Companies is free from defects that
could materially interfere with the current or intended future use of such facilities, provided such future use is substantially similar to its current use.

 
Section 4.16               Environmental Matters.
 

With respect to OLB and each OLB Subsidiary:
 
(a)        Neither the conduct nor operation of its business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or operated by it

(including REO) results or resulted in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a material liability (including a
material remediation obligation) upon OLB or any OLB Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of OLB, no condition has existed or event has occurred with
respect to any of them or any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to
OLB or any OLB Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither OLB nor any OLB Subsidiary during the past five years has received
any written notice from any Person or Regulatory Authority that OLB or any OLB Subsidiary or the operation or condition of any property ever
owned or operated by any of them are currently in violation of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under any Environmental Laws or relating to
Hazardous Materials (including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any Hazardous
Materials at, on, beneath or originating from any such property) for which a material liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon OLB or any
OLB Subsidiary;

 
(b)        There is no Order or Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of OLB threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other

forum against OLB or any OLB Subsidiary (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental
Law or (ii) relating to the presence, release, discharge, spillage or disposal into the environment of, any Hazardous Materials, whether or not
occurring at, on, under, adjacent to or affecting (or potentially affecting) a site currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by any OLB Company
or any OLB Real Property, nor, to the Knowledge of OLB, is there any reasonable basis for any such Litigation or Order;

(c)        To the Knowledge of OLB, (i) there are no underground storage tanks on, in or under any OLB Real Property, and (ii) no
underground storage tanks have been closed or removed from any OLB Real Property except in compliance with Environmental Laws in all material
respects; and

 
(d)        To the Knowledge of OLB, the OLB Real Properties (including, without limitation, soil, groundwater or surface water on, or under

the properties, and buildings thereon) are not contaminated with and do not otherwise contain any Hazardous Materials other than as permitted under
applicable Environmental Laws.

 
Section 4.17               Information to be Supplied.

time the Registration Statement is declared effective pursuant to the Securities Act, and as of the date the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is mailed to the
holders of OLB Common Stock and BYBK Common Stock, and up to and including the date of the OLB Common Stockholders’ Meeting and the

the OLB board of directors deems material to a vote on the Merger, and (iii) will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Registration Statement as promulgated by the SEC.

 
(b)        The information supplied by OLB for inclusion in the Applications will, at the time each such document is filed with any Regulatory

Authority and up to and including the dates of any required regulatory approvals or consents, as such Applications may be amended by subsequent
filings, be accurate in all material respects.

 
(c)        No document or certificate delivered to BYBK by or for OLB pursuant to a requirement of this Agreement contains any untrue

statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statement contained in such document or certificate, in light of the
circumstances under which it was made, not misleading.

 
Section 4.18               Related Party Transactions.
 

Except as set forth on OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.18, as is disclosed in the OLB Financials, and/or as disclosed in the OLB SEC Reports,
neither OLB nor any OLB Subsidiary is a party to any transaction (including any loan or other credit accommodation but excluding deposits in the
Ordinary Course) with any Affiliate of OLB or any OLB Subsidiary, and all such transactions were made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with Persons who are not related to or Affiliates of OLB or
any OLB Subsidiary.

 
Section 4.19               Loans.
 

(a)        Except as disclosed in OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.19, all Credit Extensions reflected as assets in the OLB Financials or currently
outstanding that will be reflected as assets in the OLB Financials arose out of bona fide arm’s-length transactions, were made for good and valuable
consideration in the Ordinary Course, and are evidenced by notes, Contracts or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine, correct and
what they purport to be, and to the extent secured, are secured by valid Liens that are legal, valid and binding obligations of the maker thereof,
enforceable in accordance with the respective terms thereof, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or equitable
principles affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights that have been perfected or (ii) the pledge of any Credit Extension to the FHLB as collateral
to secure the performance by the OLB Companies of all obligations owed thereto. All Credit Extensions reflected, or currently outstanding that will
be reflected, as assets in the OLB Financials were made in accordance in all material respects with sound banking practices and, to the Knowledge of
OLB, are not subject to any defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, including without limitation any such as are afforded by usury or truth in lending
Laws, except as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or by general principles of equity.

(b)        To the Knowledge of OLB, neither the terms of any Credit Extension by any of the OLB Companies, any of the documentation for
any such Credit Extension, the manner in which any such Credit Extension has been administered and serviced, nor the practices of approving or
rejecting applications for a Credit Extension by the OLB Companies, violate in any material respect any Law applicable thereto, including, without
limitation, the Truth In Lending Act and the CFPB’s Regulation Z, the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and any Laws relating to consumer
protection, installment sales and usury.

 
(c)        There are no executive officer or director (as such terms are defined in the FRB’s Regulation O) Credit Extensions by any of the

OLB Companies on which the borrower is paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security agreement or on
which the borrower is paying a rate that was not in compliance with Regulation O and all such Credit Extensions are and were originated in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

 
(d)        To the Knowledge of OLB, no shares of OLB Common Stock were purchased with the proceeds of a loan made by any of the OLB

Companies.
 

Section 4.20               Allowance for Loan Losses.
 

The allowance for loan losses reflected in reports by the OLB Companies to each Regulatory Authority has been and will be established in
compliance with the requirements of all regulatory criteria, and the allowance for loan losses shown in the OLB Financials has been and will be
established and maintained in accordance with GAAP and applicable Law and in a manner consistent with Old Line’s internal policies. The
allowance for loan losses reflected in such reports and the allowance for loan losses shown in the OLB Financials, in the opinion of management,
was or will be adequate as of the dates thereof. The REO and in-substance foreclosures included in any of Old Line’s non-performing assets are
carried net of reserves at the lower of cost or market value based on current independent appraisals or current management appraisals. OLB has
disclosed to BYBK on OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.20 all Credit Extensions (including participations) by and all interest-bearing assets of the OLB
Companies (a) that are in an amount of at least $1.0 million and have been accelerated during the past 12 months, (b) that are in an amount of at least
$1.0 million and have been terminated during the past 12 months by reason of a default or adverse development in the condition of the borrower or
other events or circumstances affecting the credit of the borrower, and (c) pursuant to which a borrower, customer or other party has notified any of
the OLB Companies during the past 12 months of, or has asserted against any of the OLB Companies, in each case in writing, any “lender liability”
or similar claim, and, to the Knowledge of OLB, each borrower, customer or other party that has given any of the OLB Companies any oral
notification of, or orally asserted to or against any of the OLB Companies, any such claim, and OLB shall provide an updated OLB Disclosure
Schedule 4.20 promptly to BYBK after the end of each month after the date hereof and on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

 
Section 4.21               Community Reinvestment Act.
 

Old Line is the only OLB Company that is subject to the CRA. To the Knowledge of OLB, OLB is in compliance in all material respects
with the CRA and all regulations promulgated thereunder. OLB has supplied BYBK with a copy of Old Line’s current CRA Statement, all letters and
written comments received by Old Line since March 6, 2017 pertaining thereto and any responses by Old Line to such comments. Old Line has a
rating of “satisfactory” or better as of its most recent CRA compliance examination and OLB and Old Line have received no communication from
any Regulatory Authority that would lead OLB to believe that Old Line will not receive a rating of “satisfactory” or better pursuant to its next CRA
compliance examination or that any Regulatory Authority would seek to restrain, delay or prohibit any of the Contemplated Transactions as a result
of any act or omission of Old Line under the CRA.

 
Section 4.22               Securities Activities of Employees.
 

To the Knowledge of OLB, the officers, employees and agents of the OLB Companies are now, and at all times in the past have been, in

licenses and permits.

Section 4.23               Books and Records; Internal Control.
 

(a)        The minute books and stock ledgers of the OLB Companies that have been made available to BYBK, its Representatives or its
Affiliates constitute all of the minute books and stock ledgers of the OLB Companies and as of their dates contain a materially complete and accurate
record of all actions of their respective stockholders and boards of directors (and any committees thereof) and have been maintained in accordance
with applicable Law. All personnel files, reports, feasibility studies, environmental assessments and reports, strategic planning documents, financial
forecasts, deeds, leases, lease files, land files, accounting and tax records and all other records that relate to the business and properties of the OLB
Companies that have been requested by BYBK have been made available to BYBK, its Representatives or its Affiliates.

 
(b)        OLB maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the

Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions by or with the OLB Companies are executed in accordance with
management’s general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions by or with the OLB Companies are recorded as necessary (A) to permit the
preparation of financial statements and reports filed with any Regulatory Authority in conformity with GAAP consistently applied and any other
criteria applicable to such statements, and (B) to maintain accountability for assets and liabilities; (iii) access to the assets of, and the incurrence of
liabilities by, the OLB Companies is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations; (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets and liabilities of the OLB Companies is compared with existing assets and liabilities of the OLB Companies at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences; and (v) extensions of credit by and other receivables of the OLB Companies
are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Except as
disclosed in the OLB SEC Reports, since December 31, 2012, neither OLB nor, to OLB’s Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of any OLB Company, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the adequacy of OLB’s internal control over financial reporting or integrity of the OLB Financials or the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
OLB or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that OLB or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. Except as disclosed in the OLB SEC Reports, to the Knowledge
of OLB there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal control over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect OLB’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information. To the
Knowledge of OLB, there has occurred no fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in OLB’s internal control over financial reporting.

 
(c)        Each of the OLB Companies makes and keeps Books and Records that, in reasonable detail and in all material respects, accurately

and fairly reflect its transactions in and dispositions of its assets and securities, and all such Books and Records have been and are being maintained
in the Ordinary Course in accordance with applicable Law and accounting requirements. None of the records, systems, controls, data or information
of the OLB Companies are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not
under the exclusive ownership and control of the OLB Companies or their accountants, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No attorney representing OLB or any OLB Subsidiary, whether or not employed by OLB or any OLB Subsidiary, has
reported evidence of a material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by OLB or any of its officers, directors or
employees to the board of directors of OLB or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of OLB. To OLB’s Knowledge, there has been no
instance of fraud by any OLB Company, whether or not material, that occurred during any period covered by OLB Financials.

 
Section 4.24               Investment Securities.
 

Each of the OLB Companies has good and marketable title to all securities that it owns (except those sold under repurchase agreements or
held in any fiduciary or agency capacity). None of the investment securities reflected in the OLB Financials under the headings “investment
securities available for sale” and “investment securities held to maturity” and, except as described in OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.24, none of the
investment securities acquired by the OLB Companies since June 30, 2017, are subject to any restrictions, whether contractual or statutory, that
materially impair such OLB Company’s ability to freely dispose of such investment securities at any time, and such OLB Company was permitted by
applicable Law to acquire such investment securities at the time they were acquired.

Section 4.25               Reorganization.
 

As of the date hereof, OLB does not have any reason to believe that the Merger will fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC. None of the OLB Companies will take any action that will cause, cause any action to be taken that will cause
or fail to take any action or fail to cause any action to be taken if such failure to act will have the effect of causing, the Merger not to qualify as a tax-
free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC, nor have any of the OLB Companies taken, caused, agreed to take or cause or
failed to take or cause any such action.

 
Section 4.26               Fairness Opinion.
 

OLB’s board of directors has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion,
dated no later than the date of this Agreement) from FIG Partners, LLC, to the effect that, as of the date thereof, and subject to the terms, conditions
and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration payable by OLB to stockholders of BYBK pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is fair, from
a financial point of view, to the stockholders of OLB. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 
Section 4.27               Materials Provided to Stockholders.
 

All proxy materials used in connection with the meetings of OLB’s stockholders held in 2015, 2016 and 2017, along with any other form of
correspondence between OLB and its stockholders during those years, including, without limitation, any annual or quarterly reports provided to
stockholders, either have been filed with the SEC and are publicly available to BYBK via EDGAR or have been provided to BYBK.

 
Section 4.28               Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.
 

None of the OLB Companies has any obligation or liability that is material to its financial condition or operations or that, when combined
with all similar obligations or liabilities, would be material to its financial condition or operations except (a) as disclosed in the OLB Financials
delivered or made available to BYBK prior to the date of this Agreement, or (b) as contemplated under this Agreement. Except as disclosed in OLB
Disclosure Schedule 4.28, since December 31, 2016, none of the OLB Companies has incurred or paid any obligation or liability that would be
material to its financial condition or operations, except for obligations that are (a) fully reflected or reserved against on the most recent balance sheet
contained in the OLB Financials or (b) paid in connection with transactions made in the Ordinary Course consistent with applicable Law.

 
Section 4.29               Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Information Security.
 

(a)        To the Knowledge of OLB there do not exist any facts or circumstances that would cause any of the OLB Companies: (i) to be
deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any Order issued with respect to anti-
money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any
other applicable anti-money laundering Law, as well as the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program adopted by the OLB
Companies; or (ii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy Laws, including without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by the OLB Companies. To the
Knowledge of OLB, no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would
cause any of the OLB Companies to undertake any remedial action. The board of directors or other governing body of each OLB Company that is
subject to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder has adopted, and each such OLB Company has implemented, a Bank
Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that comply with
Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder and such Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program meets the
requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and it has not received written notice
from any Regulatory Authority that such program (i) does not contain adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures, or
(ii) has been deemed ineffective. Each of the OLB Companies has complied in all material respects with any requirements to file reports and other
necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

(b)        OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.29(b) describes any event, circumstance or other occurrence, and the remedial steps taken by any of the
OLB Companies with respect thereto, since January 1, 2012, that constituted either (i) a “breach of the security of a system,” as such phrase is
defined in Section 14-3504(a) of the Commercial Law Article with respect to personal information maintained by any of the OLB Companies,
without regard to the application of Section 14-3507(b) of the Commercial Law Article, or (ii) any other data breach with respect to, or other

control is reasonably protected against loss, damage and unauthorized access, use, modification or other misuse. To OLB’s Knowledge, there has
been no loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use, modification or other misuse of any such information by OLB, any of its Subsidiaries or any other
Person.

 
Section 4.30               Intellectual Property.
 

To the Knowledge of OLB, each of the OLB Companies owns or possesses valid, binding and assignable licenses and other rights to use
without payment (other than as set forth in the applicable license) all trademarks, trade dress, trade names, service marks, service names, brand
names, domain names, logos, patents, technology, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, works of authorship and other intellectual
property rights used in the conduct of its existing business, and all registrations, applications, technology rights, licenses or other Contracts relating
thereto and all Contracts relating to third party intellectual property that it is licensed or authorized to use in its business, including without limitation
any software licenses (collectively, the “OLB Intellectual Property”). To the Knowledge of OLB, all OLB Intellectual Property that is used in the
conduct of the existing businesses of the OLB Companies is free and clear of all Liens (other than OLB Permitted Liens) and any claims of
ownership by current or former employees or contractors, other than royalties or payments with respect to off-the-shelf software. With respect to
each item of OLB Intellectual Property that any of the OLB Companies is licensed or authorized to use, to the Knowledge of OLB, the license,
sublicense or Contract covering such item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect. No OLB Company is in default under or

misappropriating or violating the intellectual property of any other Person, and none of the OLB Companies has received any communications
alleging that it has infringed, diluted, misappropriated or violated any such intellectual property. None of the OLB Companies has sent any
communications alleging that any Person has infringed, diluted, misappropriated or violated any OLB Intellectual Property and, to the Knowledge of
OLB, no Person is infringing, diluting, misappropriating or violating any of the OLB Intellectual Property. Each of the OLB Companies has taken
commercially reasonable actions to protect and maintain (a) all material OLB Intellectual Property and (b) the security and integrity of its software,
databases, networks, systems, equipment and hardware and to protect the same against unauthorized use, modification or access thereto, or the
introduction of any disabling codes or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other unauthorized, damaging or corrupting software
or elements that permit or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption, impairment, disablement or destruction of, software, data or other materials.
To the Knowledge of OLB, the computers, computer software, other information technology equipment, information technology passwords and other
credentials, and all associated documents and records owned or leased by the OLB Companies (the “OLB IT Assets”), operate and perform in all
material respects in accordance with their documentation and functional specifications as required by them in connection with their business, and
none of the OLB IT Assets has materially malfunctioned or failed to meet its requirements within the past two years except for such malfunctions or
failures that have been remediated. To the Knowledge of OLB, no Person has gained unauthorized access to the OLB IT Assets. The OLB
Companies have implemented commercially reasonable backup and disaster recovery policies, procedures, systems and technology consistent with
industry practices for financial institutions of comparable size and complexity, and sufficient to reasonably maintain the operation of the respective
businesses of the OLB Companies in all material respects.

Section 5.3                  Access; Confidentiality.
 

(a)        Through the Effective Time, each Party shall afford to the other, including its authorized Representatives, reasonable access to its
and its Subsidiaries’ businesses, properties, assets, Books and Records, and personnel, at reasonable hours and after reasonable notice; and the
officers of each Party shall furnish the other Party making such investigation, including its authorized Representatives, with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to such businesses, properties, assets, Books and Records, and personnel as the Party making such
investigation, or its authorized Representatives, shall from time to time reasonably request. Each Party agrees that it, and its authorized
Representatives, will conduct such investigation and discussions hereunder in a confidential manner and otherwise in a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the other Party’s normal operations and customer and employee relationships. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall
be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate the rights of its customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Party in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law or binding Contract entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
previous sentence apply. No investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and
Contracts of the other Party.

 
(b)        BYBK and OLB each agree that it will not, and will cause their Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this

Section 5.3 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with entering into this Agreement) for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. BYBK and OLB shall hold all information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.3
(as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with entering into this Agreement) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Parties agree
that such Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in accordance with its terms, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

 
Section 5.4                  Regulatory Matters.
 

Through the Effective Time:
 
(a)        OLB and BYBK shall cooperate with one another in the preparation of the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus/Proxy

Statement) and all Applications, which shall be prepared by OLB and OLB’s counsel, to the extent such Applications are required to be filed by an
OLB Company, and by BYBK and BYBK’s counsel, to the extent such Applications are required to be filed by a BYBK Company, and the making
of all filings for, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all necessary permits, consents, approvals, waivers
and authorizations of all Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and to comply with the terms
and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations; provided, however, that in no event shall OLB or BYBK be
required to agree to any prohibition, limitation or other requirement that would (i) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by OLB or
any OLB Subsidiary of all or any material portion of the business or assets of BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary, (ii) compel OLB or BYBK to dispose
of all or any material portion of either Party’s business or assets, (iii) impose a material compliance burden, penalty or obligation on OLB or BYBK,
or (iv) otherwise materially impair the value of BYBK to OLB (any such requirement alone, or more than one such requirement together, a
“Burdensome Condition”).

 
(b)        BYBK and OLB shall each promptly furnish the other with copies of written communications to, or received by them from, any

Regulatory Authority with respect to the Contemplated Transactions to the extent permitted by Law.
 
(c)        BYBK and OLB shall cooperate with each other in the foregoing matters and shall furnish the other with all information concerning

itself as may be necessary or advisable in connection with any Application or filing, including any report filed with the SEC, made by or on behalf of
such Party to or with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and in each such case, the information shall be
accurate and complete in all material respects. In connection therewith, BYBK and OLB shall use their reasonable good faith efforts to provide each
other certificates, “comfort” letters and other documents reasonably requested by the other to the extent such disclosure is permitted by Law. Each
Party shall have the right to review and approve in advance (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) all
characterizations of the information relating to it and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions with any Regulatory Authority. In addition, OLB and BYBK shall each give the other reasonable time to review the Registration
Statement and any Application to be filed by it prior to the time such Application is filed with the relevant Regulatory Authority, and each shall
consult the other with respect to the substance and status of such filings.

Section 5.5                  Taking of Necessary Actions.
 

Through the Effective Time, in addition to the specific agreements contained herein, each Party shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken by each of its Subsidiaries, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done by each of its Subsidiaries, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions as soon as practicable after the date
hereof including, if necessary, appealing any adverse ruling with respect to any Application.

 
Section 5.6                  Duty to Advise; Duty to Update of Disclosure Schedules.
 

Through the closing date, each of BYBK and OLB shall promptly advise the other of any change or event having or reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect or that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein. Through the Closing Date, BYBK shall update the BYBK Disclosure Schedules, and OLB
shall update the OLB Disclosure Schedules, as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of any event that, if such event had occurred prior to the
date hereof, would have been disclosed on such schedule. In addition, BYBK shall update and deliver to OLB the BYBK Disclosure Schedule
3.20(a) and the BYBK Disclosure Schedule 3.21, and OLB shall update and deliver to BYBK the OLB Disclosure Schedule 4.20, promptly after the
end of each calendar month during the Pre-Closing Period and on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The delivery of such
updated Disclosure Schedules shall not relieve either Party from liability for any breach or violation of this Agreement and shall not have any effect
for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Sections 6.1(b) or 6.2(b).

 
Section 5.7                  Other Undertakings by OLB and BYBK.
 

(a)        Undertakings of BYBK.
 

(i)                   Stockholder Approval. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, in accordance with applicable Law and this Agreement, BYBK shall submit the Merger to its stockholders for approval at the
BYBK Common Stockholders’ Meeting with the recommendation that its stockholders approve the Merger.

 
(ii)                 Acquisition Proposals. So long as this Agreement remains in effect, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this

Agreement, BYBK shall not, and it shall not authorize, permit or cause any BYBK Subsidiary or their respective Representatives to, directly
or indirectly: (A) initiate, solicit, induce or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or providing assistance), or take any
action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes, relates or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (B) respond to any inquiry relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (C) recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal;
(D) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person

(E) release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which
BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary is a party; or (F) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar instrument,
including any exclusivity agreement, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or
any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by BYBK or any of its Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of BYBK or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by BYBK. BYBK
and each BYBK Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions, negotiations and communications with any Person with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval of the Merger by BYBK’s stockholders at the BYBK Common Stockholders’
Meeting, BYBK may respond to an inquiry, furnish nonpublic information regarding itself and the BYBK Subsidiaries to, or enter into
discussions with, any Person in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to BYBK by such Person (and not
withdrawn) if: (A) BYBK’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its
outside legal counsel and the advice of the BYBK Advisers, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined below); (B) BYBK has not violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.7(a)(ii); (C) BYBK’s
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with and based upon the advice of its outside legal counsel and the advice of
the BYBK Advisers, that such action is required in order for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law; and (D) at least two Business Days prior to furnishing any nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions with, such Person,
BYBK provides OLB with written notice of the identity of such Person and of BYBK’s intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or
enter into discussions with, such Person and BYBK receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more
favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such Person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with BYBK. BYBK shall promptly provide to OLB any non-public information regarding BYBK or any BYBK
Subsidiary provided to any other Person that was not previously provided to OLB, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such other Person.

 
BYBK shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify OLB in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any

information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, BYBK, any BYBK Subsidiary
or any of their Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the
Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations
or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications)). BYBK agrees that it shall keep
OLB informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request). BYBK further agrees that it will provide OLB with the
opportunity to present its own proposal to the BYBK board of directors in response to any such proposal or offer and negotiate with OLB in
good faith with respect to any such proposal.

 
For purposes of this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal (or its most recently

amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal on terms that the BYBK
board of directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of BYBK’s outside legal
counsel and the BYBK Advisers: (A) would, if consummated, result in consideration that is more favorable to the stockholders of BYBK
than the Contemplated Transactions (taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the
Person making the proposal); (B) is not conditioned on obtaining financing (and with respect to which BYBK has reasonably assured itself
of such Person’s ability to fully finance its Acquisition Proposal); (C) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less
than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of BYBK Common Stock or all or substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the BYBK
Companies on a consolidated basis; and (D) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

 
Neither the BYBK board of directors nor any committee thereof shall: (A) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw,

qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to OLB in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including the Merger), its
recommendation to the stockholders of BYBK to approve the Merger, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the
BYBK Common Stockholders’ Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the recommendation to the stockholders of BYBK to approve the
Merger (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of such recommendation); (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; or (C) enter into (or cause BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement (1) related to any Acquisition Proposal or (2) requiring BYBK to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
any of the Contemplated Transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the BYBK Common Stockholders’ Meeting, BYBK’s board of directors may
approve or recommend to the stockholders of BYBK a Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation in
connection with the Agreement and the Merger or take any of the other actions otherwise prohibited by this Section 5.7(a)(ii) after the third
Business Day following the receipt by OLB of a notice (the “Notice of Superior Proposal”) from BYBK advising OLB that the BYBK
board of directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.7(a)(ii)) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that BYBK shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal in respect of any materially revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that BYBK proposes to accept and the
subsequent notice period shall be three Business Days) if, but only if, (A) the BYBK board of directors has reasonably determined in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and the advice of the BYBK Advisers, that the
failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) at the end of such three Business
Day period, after taking into account any adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been committed to in writing by OLB since
OLB’s receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal (provided, however, that OLB shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), the BYBK board of directors has again in good faith made the
determination (1) in clause (A) of this paragraph, and (2) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 
(iii)                Environmental Assessments.
 

(A)                OLB shall have the express right, but not the obligation, to conduct, at its sole cost and expense,
Environmental Assessments of the BYBK Companies’ assets, operations and secured interests, including, but not limited to, the
BYBK Real Properties. For any BYBK Real Property that is not owned by a BYBK Company, access to such BYBK Real Property
by OLB shall be conditioned on approval by the property owner.

 
(B)                If OLB, in its sole discretion, is unable to reasonably determine that the recognized environmental conditions

identified in the Environmental Assessments will not result in a Material Adverse Effect, OLB shall have the express right, but not
the obligation, to further assess, at its sole cost and expense, the recognized environmental conditions as OLB deems appropriate
subject to the following provisions of this Section 5.7(a)(iii)(B). For any BYBK Real Property that is owned by a BYBK Company,
such further assessment shall be subject to prior notice to BYBK. For any BYBK Real Property that is not owned by a BYBK
Company, such further assessment by OLB shall be conditioned on approval by the property owner.

 
(C)                OLB agrees to notify BYBK a reasonable time in advance of any Environmental Assessments scheduled

pursuant to this Section 5.7(a)(iii). Upon receipt of such notice, BYBK agrees to permit OLB and its Representatives to (1) conduct
such Environmental Assessments, (2) have access to the properties, facilities, environmental documents and personnel of the
BYBK Companies, and (3) conduct such consultations with the Persons conducting such examinations, as OLB shall deem
necessary; provided, however, that OLB agrees that the exercise of its rights under this Section 5.7(a)(iii) shall not unreasonably
disturb or interfere with the business activities or operations of the BYBK Companies. Upon request by BYBK, OLB shall provide
copies of reports prepared by OLB or its Representatives for the assessments conducted under this Section 5.7(a)(iii).

 
(iv)               Dissolve Non-Operational Subsidiaries. Prior to Closing, BYBK shall cause the liquidation and legal dissolution of

any and all Non-Operational Subsidiaries.

(v)                 401(k) Plans. If requested by OLB in a writing delivered to BYBK following the date hereof and prior to the Closing
Date, the BYBK Companies shall take all necessary action (including without limitation the adoption of resolutions and plan amendments
and the delivery of any required notices) to terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, any BYBK Benefit Plan that is
intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined contribution plan under IRC Section 401(k) (a “401(k) Plan”). BYBK shall provide OLB with
a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the termination of the 401(k) Plans in
advance and give OLB a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith by
BYBK), and prior to the Closing Date, BYBK shall provide OLB with the final documentation evidencing the termination of the 401(k)
Plans. In the event of termination of the 401(k) Plan, OLB and BYBK shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford participants in the
401(k) Plan who are Retained Employees with outstanding participant loans under such plan to elect a rollover of the loan balance from the
401(k) Plan to a 401(k) plan of OLB in connection with an election by such participant to rollover his or her entire account in the 401(k)
Plan to a 401(k) plan of OLB, subject to the terms and conditions of the OLB’s 401(k) plan and the requirements of the OLB’s 401(k) plan
record-keeper; provided, that each such loan satisfies all material legal requirements, is not a nonexempt “prohibited transaction” under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC and is not in default as of the date of the rollover. No action taken by BYBK or any of the
Bay Companies pursuant to this Section 5.1(a)(v) at the request of OLB, and no financial or other effect as a result thereof, whether taken
individually or in the aggregate, shall be deemed to have or constitute a Material Adverse Effect for any purpose contemplated by this
Agreement.

 
(vi)               Other BYBK Benefit Plans. To the extent requested by OLB prior to the Closing Date, the BYBK Companies shall

cooperate in good faith with OLB to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any BYBK Benefit Plan not covered by subsection (v) of this
Section 5.7(a) in accordance with the terms of such plan or agreement and applicable Law, to be effective as of the Effective Time (or at
such time mutually agreed to by the Parties), except that the winding up of any such plan or agreement may be completed following the
Closing Date; provided, however, that none of the Bay Companies shall be required to take any action to terminate the Carrollton Bank
Retirement Income Plan. BYBK shall provide OLB with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared
to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 5.7(a)(vi), as applicable, and give OLB a reasonable opportunity to comment on such
documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith by BYBK), and prior to the Closing Date, BYBK shall provide OLB with the
final documentation evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been effectuated. No action taken by BYBK or any of the Bay
Companies pursuant to this Section 5.1(a)(vi) at the request of OLB, and no financial or other effect as a result thereof, whether taken
individually or in the aggregate, shall be deemed to have or constitute a Material Adverse Effect for any purpose contemplated by this
Agreement.

 
(b)        Undertakings of OLB and BYBK.
 

(i)       Public Announcements. OLB and BYBK shall consult upon the form and substance of any press release or public statement
related to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions and shall not issue any press release or make any public statement without the
prior consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, but nothing contained herein shall prohibit either
Party, following notification to the other Party, from making any disclosure that its counsel deems necessary under applicable Law or the
rules and regulations of any securities exchange.

 
(ii)       Maintenance of Insurance. OLB and each OLB Subsidiary, and BYBK and each BYBK Subsidiary, shall maintain

Insurance Policies in such amounts as OLB and BYBK, respectively, believe are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in relation
to the character and location of its and their respective Subsidiaries’ properties and the nature of its and their respective Subsidiaries’
businesses.

 
(iii)       Maintenance of Books and Records. OLB and each OLB Subsidiary, and BYBK and each BYBK Subsidiary, shall

maintain Books and Records in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with past practice.
 
(iv)       Taxes. OLB and each OLB Subsidiary shall file all OLB Returns, and BYBK and each BYBK Subsidiary shall file all

BYBK Returns, required to be filed by them, respectively, on or before the date such returns are due, including any extensions, and pay all
taxes shown to be due on such returns on or before the dates such payments are due, except those being contested in good faith.

(v)       In-House Operations. OLB and BYBK shall cooperate with each other in the interest of an orderly, cost-effective
consolidation of operations.

 
(vi)       Delivery of Financial Statements. OLB and BYBK shall each deliver or make available to the other, promptly upon their

completion, but in each case by each respective delivery date, financial statements that (A) are true, accurate and complete in all material
respects, and that have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the Books and Records of the applicable Party and its Subsidiaries,
(B) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and
cash flows of such Party as of and for the periods ended on the dates thereof, and (C) comply in all material respects with applicable
accounting and regulatory requirements and, other than the Internal BYBK Financials, are prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied, except for (1) omission of the notes from the financial statements, applicable to any interim period, and (2) with respect to any
interim period, normal year-end adjustments and notes thereto.

 
(vii)       Delivery of Regulatory Filings and Documents. Except where prohibited by Law, OLB and BYBK shall each deliver to

the other copies of all reports filed with Regulatory Authorities promptly upon the filing thereof.
 

(c)       Undertakings of OLB.
 

(i)                   Stockholder Approval. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, in accordance with the Exchange Act, applicable Law and this Agreement, OLB shall submit the Merger to its
stockholders for approval at the OLB Common Stockholders’ Meeting with the recommendation that its stockholders approve the
Merger.

 
(ii)                 BYBK Director Nominees. Subject to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of OLB and Old Line, the MGCL,

any approvals and/or requirements of any Regulatory Authority relating to OLB and the continuing fiduciary duties of the OLB board
of directors, the OLB board of directors shall take such actions as may be necessary to (A) elect, as soon as is practicable following the
Effective Time, (1) Eric D. Hovde, (2) Joseph J. Thomas and (3) one other individual currently serving on BYBK’s board of directors as
the Parties mutually agree to at a later date (the “BYBK Nominees”) or, if applicable, a Replacement Nominee listed on BYBK
Disclosure Schedule 5.7(c)(ii), to serve on the OLB board of directors until the next annual meeting of OLB stockholders that occurs
after the Effective Time, (B) cause the BYBK Nominees to be elected, as soon as is practicable following the Effective Time, to serve
on the Old Line board of directors until the next annual meeting of Old Line’s stockholders that occurs after the Effective Time, (C)
nominate each of the BYBK Nominees (or, in each case, his Replacement Nominee) for re-election to the OLB board of directors at the
annual meeting of OLB’s stockholders that follows the Effective Time, with (1) the individual to be selected by the Parties at a later
date (or his Replacement Nominee, if applicable) to serve for a term of at least one year, (2) Joseph J. Thomas (or his Replacement
Nominee, if applicable) to serve for a term of at least two years and (3) Eric D. Hovde (or his Replacement Nominee, if applicable) to
serve for a term of at least three years, and (D) cause the BYBK Nominees to be elected to serve on the Old Line board of directors at
the annual meeting of Old Line’s stockholders that follows the Effective Time, to serve for a term consistent with those set forth in
subsection (C) hereof; provided, however, that if any of the BYBK Nominees shall be subject to a Disqualification Event or declines,
prior to the Effective Time, to serve on the OLB board of directors, OLB shall take such actions as may be necessary to fill the vacancy
created with one of the individual(s) set forth on BYBK Disclosure Schedule 5.7(c)(ii) (each a “Replacement Nominee”), with the
selection being at OLB’s discretion except as expressly provided otherwise in BYBK Disclosure Schedule 5.7(c)(ii).

 
On and after the Effective Time, (A) the directors of OLB duly elected and holding office immediately prior to the Effective Time,

and (B) provided the BYBK Nominees agree to serve as a director of OLB, the BYBK Nominees, shall be the directors of OLB, each to
hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or otherwise in accordance with applicable Law and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of OLB and Old Line, as applicable; further provided, that in no event shall OLB’s obligations under this section
apply with respect to any of the BYBK Nominees if such BYBK Nominee shall be subject to a Disqualification Event.

As used in this Agreement, the term “Disqualification Event” means, as to the BYBK Nominees, the occurrence of any of the
following events: (A) such nominee shall be prohibited by Law or otherwise from serving as a director of OLB; (B) such nominee shall
have been charged with or convicted of any felony or a crime of moral turpitude; (C) such nominee shall file (or any Entity of which such
nominee shall have been an executive officer or controlling person within the 90 days prior to filing shall file) a voluntary petition under any
applicable federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law, or such nominee shall become (or any Entity indebted to OLB of which such
nominee shall have been an executive officer or controlling person within the 90 days prior to filing shall become) the subject of an
involuntary petition filed under any such law that is not dismissed within 90 days; (D) such nominee shall be involved in any of the events
or circumstances enumerated in Item 401(f)(3)-(6) of Regulation S-K (or any successor or substitute provision of similar import)
promulgated by the SEC, or similar provisions of state “blue sky” laws; (E) the death, disability or other personal reasons beyond the control
of such nominee that prevents him from serving, as determined by OLB in its sole discretion, as a nominee; or (F) such nominee shall
violate any covenant or agreement contained in the Support Agreement. OLB will (A) take such actions as are necessary to cause Old Line,
subject to the fiduciary duties of the Old Line board of directors, Old Line’s articles of incorporation and bylaws and the eligibility
requirements of any Regulatory Authority relating to Old Line, and provided that the BYBK Nominees are not subject to a Disqualification
Event, to nominate the BYBK Nominees to serve as directors of Old Line during any time, and for the same term, that the BYBK Nominees
serve as directors of OLB, and (B) will, as the sole stockholder of Old Line, vote to elect the BYBK Nominee so nominated by Old Line.

 
(iii)                Employees, Severance Policy.
 

(A)                Subject to OLB’s or the applicable OLB Subsidiary’s personnel and employment qualification policies and
the provisions hereof, and subject to OLB’s right to require, in its sole discretion and as a condition of employment, such
individuals to execute confidentiality, non-competition and/or non-solicitation agreements, OLB will endeavor to continue the
employment of each individual who was an employee of BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary as of August 4, 2017 and was continuously
an employee of BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary until immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “BYBK Employee”) in a position
that will contribute to the successful performance of the combined organization as OLB deems appropriate, consistent with its
plans and strategies, for the efficient and effective operation of the OLB Companies after the Effective Time. All such employees
who accept offers of employment from an OLB Company (the “Retained Employees”) will be employed on an at-will basis.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.7(c)(iii), no provision of this Agreement shall create any
obligation of OLB or an OLB Subsidiary to retain any BYBK Employee or create any third party benefit except for the
Indemnified Parties’ rights under Section 5.7(c)(v), which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives. If a BYBK Employee is not retained as
contemplated and described in this Section 5.7(c)(iii)(A), or if OLB elects to eliminate a position or does not offer a BYBK
Employee comparable employment with an OLB Company (i.e., a position of substantially similar job descriptions or
responsibilities at substantially the same salary level), or a Retained Employee is terminated by an OLB Company without Cause
within six months of the Effective Date (each such BYBK Employee or Retained Employee, a “Displaced Employee”), then OLB
will make, or cause Old Line or the applicable OLB Subsidiary to make, severance payments to the Displaced Employee as set
forth in this Section 5.7(c)(iii).

 
(B)                Subject to the provisions of Section 5.7(c)(iii)(D), OLB will pay, or will cause Old Line or the applicable

OLB Subsidiary to pay, to any Displaced Employee:
 

(1) With respect to non-exempt Displaced Employees, two weeks of severance pay plus one additional week of
severance pay for each full year of employment with BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary, up to a maximum of 12 weeks of severance
pay;

 

 A-74  



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/859222/000117184318001135/defm14a_021318.htm 213/225

 

(2) With respect to Displaced Employees who are exempt officers or employees of a BYBK Company with less
than five full years of employment with BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary, six weeks of severance pay plus one additional week of
severance pay for each full year of employment with BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary, up to a maximum of ten weeks of severance
pay; and

 
(3) With respect to Displaced Employees who are exempt officers or employees of a BYBK Company with at

least five full years of employment with BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary, 12 weeks of severance pay plus two additional weeks of
severance pay for each full year of employment with BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary beyond five years of employment, up to a
maximum of 26 weeks of severance pay.

 
Severance benefits as set forth in this Section 5.7(c)(iii)(B) will be calculated based on the applicable Displaced

Employee’s base salary or other base rate of pay in effect for such Displaced Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Years of employment will be based on the applicable Displaced Employee’s number of full years employed with BYBK or a
BYBK Subsidiary or any predecessor thereto.

 
(C)                Any Retained Employee whose employment with OLB or an OLB Subsidiary is terminated without Cause

after six months from the Effective Date shall receive such severance benefit from OLB or such OLB Subsidiary as is provided for
in OLB’s or the applicable OLB Subsidiary’s general severance policy for such terminations (with full credit being given for each
full year of service with BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary).

 
(D)                Any BYBK Employee who has or is party to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in

control agreement or any other Contract (a “CIC Agreement”) that provides for any payment that would be triggered by the Merger
or the Bank Merger (“CIC Payment”) shall not receive any severance benefits as provided in Sections 5.7(c)(iii)(A) and (B) but
will receive the CIC Payment upon the occurrence of a triggering event under the CIC Agreement. Any BYBK Employee who
waives and relinquishes his or her right to a CIC Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in Sections 5.7(c)
(iii)(A) and (B).

 
(E)                OLB and any OLB Subsidiary’s obligation hereunder to make payments as provided in this Section 5.7(c)

(iii) is expressly subject to OLB obtaining a non-objection or waiver of any regulatory prohibition or limitation on such payment,
and OLB’s obligation hereunder is limited to such amount as determined by the Regulatory Authorities. BYBK will obtain written
acknowledgement of OLB’s obligation hereunder from all BYBK employees and officers who may be eligible for such payments.
OLB will use reasonable efforts to obtain any required regulatory approval or non-objection and shall file any required notice or
application to obtain such approval or non-objection no later than the later of (1) the date it files its application for approval of the
Bank Merger or (2) the date it becomes aware of the need to obtain any such approval or non-objection.

 
(iv)               Employee Benefits. As of the Effective Time, each Retained Employee shall be entitled to full credit for each year of

service with BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary for purposes of determining eligibility for participation and vesting and benefit accrual in
OLB’s or, as appropriate, in the OLB Subsidiary’s, employee benefit plans, programs and policies, except as prohibited by Law. OLB shall
use the original date of hire by BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary in making these determinations.

 
(v)                 Indemnification.

(A)                From and after the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, OLB (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of
the Effective Time (the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred after the Effective Time (“Costs”) in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (“Claim”), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, based in whole or in part, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or officer of BYBK or a BYBK Subsidiary or is or
was serving at the request of BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, trustee or other agent of any other
organization or in any capacity with respect to any BYBK Benefit Plan, including, without limitation, any matters arising in connection with
or related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, and will advance
expenses (including, for the avoidance of doubt, reasonable attorneys’ fees) to such Indemnified Party in connection therewith, to the fullest
extent to which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to the right to advancements of expenses or to be indemnified under the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of BYBK in effect on the date of this Agreement as though the Indemnified Parties were present or former
directors or officers of OLB, or were serving at the request of OLB or any OLB Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, trustee or other
agent of any other organization or in any capacity with respect to any OLB Benefit Plan, as of the Effective Time. OLB’s obligations under
this Section 5.7(c)(v) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years and one day from the Effective Date; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim.

 
(B)                In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (A) OLB shall have the

right to assume the defense thereof and OLB shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if OLB elects not to
assume such defense or independent legal counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there are substantive issues that raise conflicts of
interest between OLB and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it, and OLB shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that OLB
shall be obligated pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(v) and this Section 5.7(c)(vi) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties and
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; (B) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such Claim; and
(C) OLB shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further, that OLB shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall
have become final and not subject to further appeal, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 5.7(c)(v) to the contrary, OLB shall have no obligation to
indemnify an Indemnified Party in respect of a Claim if the Indemnified Party fails to provide notice of such Claim to OLB promptly after
becoming aware thereof and such failure to provide notice materially prejudices OLB with respect to such Claim. Any such notice from an
Indemnified Party will be effective if given in accordance with Section 8.6(a) of this Agreement, provided, however, that such notice must
be provided to OLB at its then-current main office.

 
(vi)               NASDAQ Listing. To the extent required, OLB agrees to timely file a “Listing of Additional Shares Notification

Form” with NASDAQ with respect to the shares of OLB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, and to use its best efforts to have the
review of such form completed prior to the Effective Time.

 
(vii)              Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance. Contemporaneously with the Closing, OLB shall purchase an extended

reporting period to BYBK’s current liability Insurance Policy(ies), for a period to last from the day after the Effective Date until at least the
date that is six years and one day after the Effective Date, for purposes of covering actions occurring prior to the Effective Time (the “Tail
Policy”). Provided that the aggregate cost of the Tail Policy will not exceed 150% of the current annual premium attributable to the
applicable officers’ and directors’ liability coverage in BYBK’s and/or Bay Bank’s liability Insurance Policy(ies) in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the “Maximum Premium”), the Tail Policy shall provide the same or better coverage for the individuals who are presently
covered by BYBK’s or Bay Bank’s officers’ and directors’ liability Insurance Policy(ies) and any other Insurance Policy(ies) providing
insurance coverage for BYBK’s or Bay Bank’s executive officers and directors (each such individual, an “Insured Person”), with respect to
actions, omissions, events, matters or circumstances occurring through the Effective Time. If OLB is unable to purchase the Tail Policy
having the coverage and aggregate limits contemplated by the foregoing sentence at a cost that does not exceed Maximum Premium, then
the Tail Policy purchased by OLB shall provide such coverage as may be reasonably purchased for a cost that does not exceed the
Maximum Premium. In either event, OLB may not cancel, modify or take any action to limit or terminate the Tail Policy purchased pursuant
to this Section 5.7(c)(viii) unless it replaces such Tail Policy with coverage provided by insurers having the same or better rating, coverage
and aggregate limits as such Tail Policy; provided, however, that OLB may, at its option, replace at any time such policy with another
Insurance Policy having the same or better coverage rate.

The Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. BYBK and OLB shall promptly notify the other Party if at any time it becomes aware that the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In
such event, BYBK shall cooperate with OLB in the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus/Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement that corrects such misstatement or omission, and OLB shall file an amended Registration Statement or supplement to the Registration
Statement with the SEC, and BYBK and OLB shall mail a Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any required amendment or supplement to holders of
BYBK Common Stock and the OLB Common Stock, respectively. OLB will provide BYBK and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Registration Statement and the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for additional information by and
replies to comments of the SEC prior to filing such with, or sending such to, the SEC, and will provide BYBK and its counsel with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC.

ARTICLE VII.

TERMINATION
 

Section 7.1                  Termination.
 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and notwithstanding receipt of the approval by the stockholders of both BYBK and
OLB of the Merger, this Agreement may be terminated on or at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 
(a)        By the mutual written agreement of BYBK and OLB;
 
(b)        By either BYBK or OLB (provided that the terminating Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,

covenant or other agreement contained herein in a manner that would entitle the other Party not to consummate the Contemplated Transactions) in
the event of a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of the other Party contained in this Agreement such that
(i) with respect to a representation or warranty, the condition set forth in the second clause of Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.2(b), as the case may be,
would not be satisfied, and (ii) with respect to a covenant or other agreement, the condition set forth in the first clause of Section 6.1(b) or Section

prior to the Closing; provided, that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period but may reasonably be cured within 60 days,
and such cure is being diligently pursued, no such termination shall occur prior to the expiration of such 60-day period;

(c)        By either BYBK or OLB if the Closing Date shall not have occurred prior to April 30, 2018 (except that if the Closing Date shall not
have occurred by April 30, 2018 because of a failure to obtain any required approval or consent of a Regulatory Authority, such date shall be June
30, 2018 unless the conditions of any such required regulatory approval or consent cannot be satisfied by June 30, 2018), except that if the Closing
Date shall not have occurred by such date because of a material breach of this Agreement by a Party, such breaching Party shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with this provision;

 
(d)        By either BYBK or OLB in the event any Regulatory Authority whose approval or consent is required for consummation of the

Condition;

 
(f)         By either BYBK or OLB if the holders of OLB Common Stock or the holders of BYBK Common Stock vote on, but fail to

approve, the Merger at the OLB Common Stockholders’ Meeting or the BYBK Common Stockholders’ Meeting, respectively;
 
(g)        By OLB if BYBK or any BYBK Subsidiary enters into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent or similar instrument

(ii)                 BYBK concurrently pays the BYBK Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.1(b); and
 
(iii)                the board of directors of BYBK concurrently approves, and BYBK concurrently enters into, a definitive agreement

with respect to such Superior Proposal;
 

(i)          By BYBK if OLB or any OLB Subsidiary enters into any definitive term sheet, letter of intent, agreement or similar type of
agreement with a view to being acquired by, or effecting a business combination, as a result of which OLB is not the surviving Entity or OLB’s
directors, as of the date of this Agreement, do not comprise the majority of the surviving Entity’s board of directors, with any person other than
BYBK, and the BYBK board of directors determines that, after considering the advice of counsel and the BYBK Advisers, such transaction is not in
the best interests of the BYBK Common Stockholders; provided, however, that BYBK must exercise the termination option under this Section 7.1(i)
within 30 calendar days after the date on which OLB is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC regarding events triggering the
termination option;

(j)         By OLB if the BYBK board of directors withdraws, changes or modifies its recommendation to its stockholders in any manner
adverse to OLB regarding this Agreement or the Merger, or the BYBK board of directors authorizes, recommends or publicly proposes, or publicly
announces an intention to authorize, recommend or propose, an agreement to enter into an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal;

 
(k)        By BYBK if the OLB board of directors withdraws, changes or modifies its recommendation to its stockholders in any manner

adverse to BYBK regarding this Agreement or the Merger;
 
(l)          By either BYBK or OLB if any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the

Contemplated Transactions shall have become final and nonappealable, provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(l) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and remove such Law; or

 
(m)      By BYBK if, at any time during the five-day period commencing with the fifth Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective

Date (the “Determination Date”), both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 

(i)                   The number obtained by dividing the average of the daily closing prices for the shares of OLB Common Stock
for the 20 consecutive full trading days on which such shares are actually traded on NASDAQ (the “Average Closing Price”) by the
Starting Price (the “OLB Ratio”) shall be less than 0.90; and

 
(ii)                 the OLB Ratio shall be less than 0.85 of the quotient of (x) the Final Index Price divided by (y) the Index Price

on the Starting Date (each as defined below) (the “Index Ratio”);
 

provided, however, that if BYBK elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(m), it shall give prompt written notice to
OLB (and provided that such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day period). During the
five-day period commencing with receipt of such notice, OLB shall have the option to increase the Merger Consideration by (A) increasing the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) or (B) provided that such payment will not result in the Merger failing to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC, making a cash payment of all or part of the increase so that, in either case, the value
of the Per Share Consideration (calculated on the basis of the Closing Price) equals the lesser of:

 
(i)                   the product of the Starting Price, 0.90 and the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any increase in

the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 7.1(m)); and
 
(ii)                 an amount equal to (A) the product of the Index Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately prior

to any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 7.1(m)), and the Average Closing Price, divided by (B) the OLB Ratio.
 

If OLB so elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to BYBK of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.1(m) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms,
provided that any references in this Agreement to the “Exchange Ratio” shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as increased
pursuant to this Section 7.1(m).

 
For purposes of this Section 7.1(m), the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
 
“Final Index Price” means the average of the Index Prices for the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior to the

Determination Date.
 
“Index Group” means the NASDAQ Bank Index.
 
“Index Price” means the closing price on such date of the Index Group.

“Starting Date” means September 26, 2017, the last trading day immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement of entry
into this Agreement.

 
“Starting Price” means $27.00.
 
If the outstanding shares of OLB Common Stock or any company belonging to the Index Group shall be changed into a different number of

shares by reason of any stock dividend, reclassification, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of the
Agreement and the Determination Date, then the Starting Price, the Average Closing Price and the other amounts in this Section 7.1(m) shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

 
Exhibit D hereto includes an example of how this Section 7.1(m) would operate under various assumptions.

ARTICLE VIII.
MISCELLANEOUS

 
Section 8.1                  Expenses and Other Fees.
 

(a)        General Expenses. Whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are consummated, each Party to this Agreement will pay its
respective expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to
indemnify the other Party against any cost, expense or liability (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and including those costs of any Party’s
enforcement of the rights afforded under this Section 8.1) in respect of any claim made by any Party for a broker’s or finder’s fee in connection with
the Merger other than one based on communications between the Party and the claimant seeking indemnification. OLB shall be responsible for and
shall pay all filing fees, trustee or exchange agent fees and expenses, and blue sky fees and expenses, if any. The expenses of separate counsel to any
stockholder of BYBK shall be borne by such stockholder and not borne or reimbursed by BYBK or OLB.

 
(b)        BYBK Termination Fee. In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by OLB while structuring and

pursuing the Merger, BYBK shall pay to OLB by wire transfer of immediately available funds a termination fee equal to $5,076,000 (the “BYBK
Termination Fee”) as follows:

 
(i)       if OLB terminates this Agreement pursuant to: (A) Section 7.1(b); (B) Section 7.1(c) because the Closing failed to occur

prior to April 30, 2018 or June 30, 2018, as applicable, and such failure resulted from the knowing, willful and intentional actions or
inactions of BYBK or Bay Bank (provided that OLB is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement); (C) Section 7.1(d) because a Regulatory Authority refused to issue a consent or approval required
for the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions and such refusal resulted from the knowing, willful and intentional actions
or inactions of BYBK or Bay Bank (provided that OLB is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement); or (D) Section 7.1(j) (provided that OLB is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement), then BYBK shall pay the BYBK Termination Fee as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within three Business Days) after termination of the Agreement; or

 
(ii)        if OLB or BYBK terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(g) or 7.1(h), then BYBK shall pay the BYBK

Termination Fee at or prior to the time of such termination.

If payment of the BYBK Termination Fee is timely made, then OLB will have no other rights or claims against BYBK and its officers,
directors, attorneys and financial advisors under this Agreement, it being agreed that the acceptance of the BYBK Termination Fee under this Section
8.1 will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of OLB against BYBK and its officers, directors, attorneys and financial advisors.

 
(c)        OLB Termination Fee. In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by BYBK while structuring and

pursuing the Merger, OLB shall pay to BYBK by wire transfer of immediately available funds a termination fee equal to $5,076,000 (the “OLB
Termination Fee”) if BYBK terminates this Agreement pursuant to: (i) Section 7.1(b); (ii) Section 7.1(c) because the Closing failed to occur prior to
April 30, 2018 or June 30, 2018, as applicable, and such failure resulted from the knowing, willful and intentional actions or inactions of OLB or Old
Line (provided that BYBK is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement);
(iii) Section 7.1(d) because a Regulatory Authority refused to issue a consent or approval required for the consummation of any of the Contemplated
Transactions and such refusal resulted from the knowing, willful and intentional actions or inactions of OLB or Old Line (provided that BYBK is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement); or (iv) Section 7.1(k) (provided
that BYBK is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement). In any such
case, OLB shall pay the OLB Termination Fee as promptly as practicable (but in any event within three Business Days) after termination of the
Agreement.

 
If payment of the OLB Termination Fee is timely made, then BYBK will have no other rights or claims against OLB and its officers,

directors, attorneys and financial advisors under this Agreement, it being agreed that the acceptance of the OLB Termination Fee under this Section
8.1 will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of BYBK against OLB and its officers, directors, attorneys and financial advisors.

 
Section 8.2                  Non-Survival.
 

All representations, warranties and, except to the extent specifically provided otherwise herein, agreements and covenants shall terminate as
of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 1.1, 1.2 1.3(b), 1.3(c), 1.3(d), 1.5, 2.5(b) through (h), 5.3(b) and 5.7(c)(ii) through (vi) and
(viii) shall survive the Closing.

 
Section 8.3                  Amendment, Extension and Waiver.
 

(a)        Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior to the Closing, the Parties may:
 

(i)       Amend this Agreement;
 
(ii)       Extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of either Party;
 
(iii)       Waive any term or condition of this Agreement, any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or

in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or
 
(iv)       Waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in Articles V and VI hereof or otherwise.
 

(b)        This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed, by authorized officers, on behalf of the Parties. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such Party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 
Section 8.4                  Entire Agreement.
 
This Agreement, the schedules and exhibits hereto, and any other documents to be executed in connection herewith, including, without limitation, the
Bank Merger Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement, contain the entire, complete and integrated agreement between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous Contracts between the Parties, written or oral, express or implied, that may

Information contained on either the BYBK Disclosure Schedule or the OLB Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to cover the express
disclosure requirement contained in a representation or warranty of this Agreement and any other representation or warranty of this Agreement of
such Party where it is readily apparent it applies to such provision. The mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a Party that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is or could result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 
Section 8.8                  Tax Disclosure.
 

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party (and its Representatives) may disclose to any and all Persons,
without limitation of any kind, the federal income tax treatment and federal income tax structure of any and all Contemplated Transactions and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to any Party (or to any Representative of any Party)
relating to such tax treatment or tax structure; provided, however, that this authorization of disclosure shall not apply to restrictions reasonably
necessary to comply with Securities Laws. This authorization of disclosure is not effective until the earlier of (a) the date of the public announcement
of discussions relating to the Contemplated Transactions, (b) the date of the public announcement of the Contemplated Transactions, or (c) the date
of execution of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into the Contemplated Transactions.

 
Section 8.9                  No Assignment.
 

Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any other person, without the prior written consent of the other Party.
 

Section 8.10               Captions; Interpretation.
 

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The Background Section hereof constitutes an integral part of this Agreement. References to Sections include
subsections, which are part of the related Section. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The phrases “the date of this Agreement,” “the date hereof” and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Recitals to this Agreement. All
words used in this Agreement shall be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise specifically noted,
the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereunder” and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section,
subsection, paragraph, clause or other subdivision of this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

 
Section 8.11               Counterparts; Electronic Signatures.
 

This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which together will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages
by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in
lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to
be their original signatures for all purposes.

 
Section 8.12               Severability.
 

The Parties agree that the provisions and covenants contained in each of the Sections of this Agreement, and within the Sections themselves,
are intended to be separate and divisible provisions and covenants and if, for any reason, any one or more of them shall be held to be invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, by a court of competent jurisdiction, then (a) the same shall not be held to affect the validity of any other
provision or covenant contained in this Agreement and (b) the same shall be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary for it to be
legally enforceable. The Parties hereby expressly request any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any such provision or covenant or to modify
any provision thereof so that it shall be enforced by such court to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
