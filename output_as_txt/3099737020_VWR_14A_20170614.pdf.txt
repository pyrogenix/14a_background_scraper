Dear Fellow Stockholder:
It is my pleasure to invite you to join us at a special meeting of the stockholders of VWR Corporation (“VWR,” the
“Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), which will be held on Thursday, July 13, 2017 at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time at The
Radnor Hotel, 591 E. Lancaster Avenue, St. Davids, Pennsylvania 19087 (the “special meeting”).

At the special meeting`, holders of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “VWR common stock”), will be asked
to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time,
the “merger agreement”), dated as of May 4, 2017, by and among Avantor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Avantor”), Vail
Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avantor (“Merger Sub”), and the Company,
relating to the proposed acquisition of the Company by Avantor. Avantor and Merger Sub are affiliates of the private equity
investment firm New Mountain Capital L.L.C. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company (the “merger”) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Avantor, and, pursuant to the Merger, each share of VWR common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (other than shares of VWR common stock held by the Company, Avantor or Merger Sub and
shares of VWR common stock held by stockholders who are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of their
shares of VWR common stock, do not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and are entitled to and properly
exercise their appraisal rights with respect thereto under Delaware law) will be converted at the effective time of the
merger into the right to receive $33.25 in cash and without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The
Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable the merger and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (iii) irrevocably approved for all purposes, to
the extent permitted by law, Avantor, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates not to be subject to any “moratorium,”
“control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “interested shareholder,” “affiliate transaction,” “business combination,” or other
antitakeover laws (including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) of any jurisdiction that
may purport to be applicable to the Company, Avantor, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with respect to any of the foregoing and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of VWR common stock vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger. The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote “FOR”
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. At the special meeting, stockholders will also be asked to vote on (i) a
proposal to approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, specified compensation that may become payable to the
named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and (ii) a proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger
agreement. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” each of these proposals.
The enclosed proxy statement describes the merger agreement and the merger and provides specific information
concerning the special meeting. In addition, you may obtain information about the Company from documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to, and you should, read the entire proxy statement

carefully, and its appendices, including the merger agreement, as it sets forth the details of the merger agreement and
other important information related to the merger.

Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares of VWR common stock you own. Whether or not
you plan to attend the special meeting, please mark, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy
card in the accompanying postage-paid envelope, or submit your proxy electronically by telephone by calling
1-800-454-8683 or over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. The merger cannot be completed unless stockholders holding
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock entitled to vote thereon affirmatively vote in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you fail to vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, the
effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement.
While stockholders may exercise their right to vote their shares of VWR common stock in person, we recognize that many
stockholders may not be able to attend the special meeting or may wish to have their shares of VWR common stock voted
by proxy even if they are able to attend. Accordingly, we have enclosed a proxy card that will enable your shares of VWR
common stock to be voted on the matters to be considered at the special meeting regardless of whether you are able to
attend. Please mark, sign and date the proxy card to indicate your voting instructions and return it in the enclosed postage-
paid envelope. You also may submit your proxy by telephone by calling 1-800-454-8683 or over the Internet at
www.proxyvote.com. We have provided instructions on the proxy card for using these convenient services. Submitting a
proxy will ensure that your shares of VWR common stock are represented at the special meeting, but will not prevent you
from submitting a subsequent proxy to change your voting instructions or from voting your shares of VWR common stock
in person if you subsequently choose to attend the special meeting.

If you hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” through a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you
should follow the directions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct your
brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of VWR common stock. Without following those
instructions or obtaining a legal proxy to vote your shares of VWR common stock through your brokerage firm,
bank, trust or other nominee, your shares of VWR common stock will not be voted, which will have the same
effect as voting against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares of VWR common stock, please contact our proxy
solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., toll free at 1 (877) 283-0325.

Thank you for your continued trust in VWR and your investment in our business.

Sincerely,
 

Manuel Brocke-Benz
Director, President and Chief Executive
Officer

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or
disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of the merger or passed upon the adequacy or
accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

June 13, 2017.

Notice of 2017 Special Meeting of Stockholders
The special meeting of stockholders of VWR Corporation (“VWR” or the “Company”) will be held on Thursday, July 13, 2017 at 11:00
a.m. EDT, at The Radnor Hotel, 591 E. Lancaster Avenue, St. Davids, Pennsylvania 19087 (the “special meeting”). Stockholders of
record of shares of VWR common stock at the close of business on June 12, 2017 are entitled to vote at the special meeting. You have
received these proxy materials because our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares of VWR common
stock at the special meeting.

The purposes of the special meeting are:
 

 

1. To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the
“merger agreement”), dated as of May 4, 2017, by and among Avantor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Avantor”), Vail Acquisition
Corp, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avantor (“Merger Sub”), and the Company, relating to the
proposed acquisition of the Company by Avantor. Avantor and Merger Sub are affiliates of the private equity investment firm
New Mountain Capital L.L.C. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company (the “merger”) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avantor;

 2. To approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s namedexecutive officers in connection with the merger; and

 
3. To consider and vote on a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent

permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the time of the special
meeting, sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement.

Our Board has fixed the close of business on June 12, 2017 as the record date for the purpose of determining the stockholders who are
entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. Only stockholders of
record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and at any adjournment or
postponement of such special meeting (unless the Board fixes a new record date for stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to
vote at, any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting in accordance with the merger agreement and the Company’s
amended and restated bylaws). Each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting is entitled to one vote for each share of VWR
common stock held by such stockholder on the record date.

The Board has unanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the
“Transactions”) are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable the merger and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the merger
agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) irrevocably approved for all purposes, to the extent
permitted by law, Avantor, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates not to be subject to any “moratorium,”
“control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “interested shareholder,” “affiliate transaction,” “business combination,”
or other antitakeover laws (including Section 203 of the DGCL) of any jurisdiction that may purport to be
applicable to the Company, Avantor, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or the merger agreement or
the Transactions with respect to any of the foregoing and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of
VWR common stock vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

Table of Contents

The Board unanimously recommends that the VWR stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, “FOR” the advisory and non-binding proposal to approve specified compensation that may become
payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and “FOR” the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the
extent permitted by the merger agreement.
VWR stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the
fair value of their shares of VWR common stock, as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), if they deliver a demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the merger agreement and comply
with all the requirements of Delaware law, including Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in the accompanying proxy
statement. Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in its entirety in Annex D to the accompanying proxy statement and is incorporated
therein by reference.

Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, please mark, sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying postage-paid envelope, or submit your proxy electronically by telephone by calling 1-800-454-8683 or
over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com as promptly as possible to ensure that your shares of VWR common stock are represented at
the special meeting. If you receive more than one proxy because you own shares of VWR common stock registered in different names
or addresses, each proxy should be submitted. If you fail to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement, the effect will be the
same as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted. You
also may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote at the special meeting by following the procedures outlined in the accompanying
proxy statement.

If you hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee
how to vote your shares of VWR common stock in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank,
brokerage firm, trust or other nominee. Your bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals,
including the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, without your instructions, which would have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

On behalf of VWR’s Board of Directors,
 

George Van Kula
Senior Vice President, Human Resources, General Counsel and Secretary

Whether or not you are able to attend the special meeting in person, please follow the instructions included on the enclosed proxy card
and submit your proxy by telephone by calling 1-800-454-8683 or over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, or mark, sign and date the
enclosed proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided as promptly as practicable. If you have Internet access, the
Company encourages you to submit your proxy over the Internet. Submitting a proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail will not
limit your right to vote in person at the special meeting. If you attend the special meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from
voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the advisory and
non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting to solicit additional
proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. If you fail to submit a proxy over the Internet, by
telephone or by mail and otherwise fail to attend the special meeting and cast your vote in person, or if you hold your shares
of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is
otherwise present, it will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on
specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the
merger agreement. If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to vote, your
shares of VWR common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the approval of the advisory and
non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent
permitted by the merger agreement.

over the Internet, you must do so by 11:59 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on July 12, 2017. If you intend to submit your proxy by mail, your
completed proxy card must be received no later than July 12, 2017. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that your
shares of VWR common stock are voted, please submit a proxy to vote your shares of VWR common stock by marking, signing, dating
and returning the enclosed proxy card or by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card or by using the Internet voting
instructions printed on your proxy card.

If you submit your proxy but do not indicate how you wish your shares of VWR common stock to be voted, your shares of VWR common
stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve the advisory and non-binding
proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection
with the merger and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

If any of your shares of VWR common stock are held in “street name,” you should instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee on how to vote such shares of VWR common stock by following the instructions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or
other nominee. If any of your shares of VWR common stock are held in “street name,” you must obtain a legal proxy from such nominee
in order to vote such shares of VWR common stock in person at the special meeting. If you fail to provide your nominee with instructions
on how to vote your shares of VWR common stock held in “street name,” your nominee will not be able to vote such shares of VWR
common stock at the special meeting.

Vote Required. The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of VWR
common stock entitled to vote thereon. If you abstain from voting, fail to submit a proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail
and also fail to attend the special meeting and cast your vote in person, or, with respect to shares of VWR common stock you
hold in “street name,” fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The approval of the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger and, if a quorum is present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,
if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the
time of the special meeting, sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement, require the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on
the subject matter. If a quorum is not present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority the shares of VWR common stock present in

person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting. If you attend the special meeting in person or by
proxy and abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the non-binding proposal on specified
compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting. If you fail to submit a proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail and also fail to
attend the special meeting and vote in person, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee, it will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified
compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger or the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, assuming a quorum is present.

A list of the VWR stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at the special meeting and at
Radnor Corporate Center, Building One, Suite 200, 100 Matsonford Road, Radnor, PA 19087 during ordinary business hours, for ten
days prior to the special meeting.

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Varietal Distribution Holdings, LLC (“Varietal”), which held
approximately 34.7% of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock as of June 12, 2017, delivered to Avantor and Merger Sub a
voting and support agreement (the “Voting and Support Agreement”), pursuant to which Varietal agreed, among other things, to vote its
shares of VWR common stock in favor of the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement and to grant an irrevocable proxy to
Avantor with respect thereto. See “The Special Meeting—Voting and Support Agreement,” on page 20 of this proxy statement, for
additional information. A copy of the Voting and Support Agreement is attached hereto as Annex B.

Revocability of Proxy. Any holder of record of shares of VWR common stock may revoke his, her or its proxy at any time before it is
voted at the special meeting by any of the following actions:
 
•  delivering to the Company’s Corporate Secretary a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy,

stating that the proxy is revoked and that is received by the Company’s Corporate Secretary no later than July 12, 2017;
•  attending the special meeting and voting such stockholder’s shares of VWR common stock in person (your attendance at the meeting

will not, by itself, revoke your proxy, you must also vote in person at the special meeting);
•  signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares of VWR common stock and bearing a later date and that is received

no later than July 12, 2017; or
•  submitting a new proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 12, 2017.

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of any proxies should be addressed to:

Attn: Corporate Secretary

If you are a “street name” holder of shares of VWR common stock, you may change your voting instructions by submitting new voting
instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee in accordance with the instructions provided by your brokerage firm,
bank, trust or other nominee. You must contact your nominee to obtain instructions as to how to change or revoke your prior voting
instructions.

The Merger (Page 27)
The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation
(the “surviving corporation”) in the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Avantor.

If the merger is completed, each share of VWR common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than
(i) shares of VWR common stock owned by the Company (excluding any shares of VWR common stock owned by any subsidiary of the
Company, which will remain outstanding), Avantor or Merger Sub and (ii) shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly
demanded and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of

Delaware (the “DGCL”)) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $33.25 in cash and without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding taxes (such amount, the “merger consideration”).

The merger consideration of $33.25 per share of VWR common stock to be received by VWR stockholders represents:
 

•  a 17% premium to the unaffected closing price of VWR common stock on May 2, 2017 (the last trading day prior to the publication of
market speculation regarding a potential sale of VWR);

•  a 20% premium over the 30 trading day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017; and
•  a 24% premium over the 90 trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017.

The closing sale price of a share of VWR common stock on NASDAQ on June 12, 2017 was $32.97. You are encouraged to obtain
current market quotations for a share of VWR common stock in connection with voting your shares of VWR common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, shares of VWR common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system and
will only represent the right to receive the merger consideration (or if you are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal of your
shares of VWR common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of your shares of VWR common stock,
together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, subject to Section 262 of the DGCL, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery). You will not own any shares of the surviving corporation. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement. Please read it carefully and in its entirety.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (Page 32)
The Board of Directors of VWR (the “Board”) unanimously (i) determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger and the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of the merger agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) irrevocably approved for all purposes, to the extent
permitted by law, Avantor and Merger Sub and their respective affiliates not to be subject to any antitakeover laws that may purport to be
applicable to the Company, Avantor, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or the merger agreement or the Transactions with
respect to any of the foregoing and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of VWR common stock vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger and merger agreement. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that holders of shares of VWR
common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

For the factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision to approve and recommend the merger agreement, see “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 32 of this proxy statement.

The Board also unanimously recommends that holders of shares of VWR common stock vote “FOR” the advisory and
non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary
and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement.

Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor (Page 37 and Annex C)
In connection with the merger, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”), VWR’s financial advisor,
delivered to the Board a written opinion, dated May 4, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the
opinion, to the holders of shares of VWR common stock, of the merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger. A
copy of the written opinion, dated May 4, 2017, of BofA Merrill Lynch, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this document and is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BofA Merrill Lynch provided its opinion to the Board (in its capacity as such) for
the benefit and use of the Board in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a
financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and no opinion or view
was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available
to VWR or in which VWR might engage or as to the underlying business decision of VWR to proceed with or effect the merger.
BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and does

The respective obligation of each party to effect the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the effective time of
certain conditions, including, among other conditions, the following:
 

•  no judgment issued by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or law or other legal prohibition (each, a “legal restraint”)
preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the merger being in effect;

specified date), other than for such failures to be true and correct that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company material adverse effect;

•  the representations and warranties of Avantor and Merger Sub being true and correct as of the date of the merger agreement and as
of the closing date as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent any such representation and warranty expressly
relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date), other than for such failures to be true and correct that

Transactions or the ability of Avantor or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under the merger agreement in any material respect;
and

•  the Company, Avantor and Merger Sub having performed, in all material respects, their respective obligations required to be
performed at or prior to the closing under the merger agreement.

Go-Shop; No-Solicitation; Competing Takeover Proposals (Page 59)
Under the merger agreement, the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers and other representatives are
permitted to, among other things, until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on June 8, 2017 (the “go-shop period end-date”):
 

•  directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage any takeover proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
VWR Board Recommendation”) or the making thereof, including by way of furnishing non-public information and other access to any
person or its representatives pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement provided that prior to or substantially concurrently
with the time it is provided to such other person (and in any event within 24 hours), the Company will make available to Avantor any
material non-public information with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries furnished to such other person not previously
furnished to Avantor; and

•  directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to,
or take any other action to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any

With respect to any person other than an excluded party (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—VWR Board
Recommendation”), beginning on the date immediately following the go-shop period end-date, the Company, its subsidiaries and their
respective directors and officers will not, and the Company will direct its and its subsidiaries’ other representatives not to:
 

•  directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, or the submission of, any takeover proposal;

•  execute or enter into any agreement or understanding with respect to any takeover proposal;

•  directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any party any information with respect to, or

take any other action to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
takeover proposal;

•  take any action to make the provisions of any applicable law or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
the Company’s organizational documents inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a takeover proposal; or

•  authorize, commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, beginning on the date immediately following the go-shop period end-date, the
Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, except with respect to any excluded party
immediately:
 

•  cease all communications, solicitations, discussions and negotiations regarding any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a takeover proposal or otherwise in connection with a takeover proposal or potential
takeover proposal;

•  request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any party within the last six months for
the purposes of evaluating a possible takeover proposal; and

•  terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible takeover proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, prior to obtaining the company requisite vote and after the
go-shop period end-date, in response to an unsolicited bona fide takeover proposal, or a takeover proposal from an excluded party, in
each case that did not result from a material breach of the foregoing, and that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior company proposal (as
defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—VWR Board Recommendation”) (such proposal, a “qualifying company takeover
proposal”) and the failure to take any such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, the Company may:
 

•  furnish non-public information and other access to the party making such qualifying company takeover proposal and its
representatives pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement so long as the Company also provides Avantor, in accordance
with the terms of its confidentiality agreement and substantially concurrently with the time such information or access is provided to
such party (and in any event within 24 hours), any material non-public information or access with respect to the Company or its
subsidiaries furnished to such other party that was not previously furnished to Avantor; and

•  enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with such party and its representatives regarding such qualifying
company takeover proposal, including soliciting, encouraging and facilitating the making of a revised qualifying company takeover
proposal.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 68)
The Company, Merger Sub and Avantor may terminate the merger agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the closing
date. In addition, either Avantor or the Company may terminate the merger agreement at any time before the closing date if:
 

•  if the closing date has not occurred on or before the outside date (an “outside date termination”) provided that this right to terminate
the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose material breach of the merger agreement has been the primary cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the merger to occur on or prior to such date; provided further, however, that if the conditions relating to
the (i) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and certain foreign antitrust laws, (ii) obtainment of
any required clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under any applicable foreign antitrust law, (iii) obtainment of required
approvals by CFIUS, if applicable and (iv) receipt of written notice of no objections under the FATA or the preclusion of objections
under the FATA due to passage of time have not been satisfied or waived as of the outside date, then the outside date will
automatically extend, without any action on the part of Company, Merger Sub or Avantor, to the date that is three months after the
outside date;

•  if CFIUS notifies Avantor or the Company in writing that CFIUS intends to send a report to the President of the United States for
decision on the matter recommending that the Transactions be suspended or prohibited or the U.S. Department of Defense, Defense
Security Service (“DSS”) refuses to accept any remedial actions whatsoever to mitigate foreign ownership, control or influence;

•  if any legal restraint permanently preventing or prohibiting the merger is in effect and becomes final and non-appealable; provided

that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause complies in all material respects with its obligations relating
to such legal restraint (treating Avantor and Merger Sub as one party); or

•  the approval by the stockholders of the Company required for the consummation of the merger is not obtained by reason of the failure
to obtain the company requisite vote at the special meeting (or any adjournments or postponements thereof) at which the merger is
voted upon (a “vote down termination”).

Avantor may also terminate the merger agreement if:
 

•  the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in the merger agreement,
which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in the merger agreement and cannot be or has
not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 30 days after the giving of written notice to the Company of such breach and (y) the second
business day prior to the outside date (provided that Avantor and Merger Sub are not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in the merger agreement) (a “Company breach termination”); or

•  prior to the date of the special meeting an adverse recommendation change (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—VWR Board Recommendation”) has occurred;

The Company may also terminate the merger agreement if:
 

•  Avantor or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in the merger
agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in the merger agreement and
cannot be or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 30 days after the giving of written notice to Avantor or Merger Sub of such
breach and (y) the second business day prior to the outside date (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in the merger agreement);

•  (i) the Board has received a superior company proposal that did not result from a breach of the Company’s obligations under the
go-shop and non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, (ii) the Company has complied with its obligations with respect to
the provisions of the merger agreement relating to an adverse recommendation change and (iii) the Company has paid, or
simultaneously with the termination of the merger agreement pays, the Company termination fee; or

•  (i) all of the conditions precedent to Avantor and Merger Sub’s respective obligation to consummate the merger have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the effective time but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied at the effective time), (ii) Avantor or Merger Sub fail to complete the closing by the date the closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement, (iii) the Company has delivered an written notice to Avantor confirming
that, if the financing is funded, it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Transactions and (iv) Avantor and Merger Sub fail
to consummate the merger within two business days following delivery of such written confirmation to Avantor.

Termination Fees and Expenses (Page 68)
The Company has agreed to pay Avantor or its designee a fee of $85 million if the merger agreement is terminated during the go-shop
period or after the go-shop period in connection with a takeover proposal (as described in “The Merger Agreement—VWR Board
Recommendation,” but substituting “50%” for each reference to “20%”) from an excluded party, or, otherwise, $170 million if the merger
agreement is terminated under certain other circumstances. Avantor has agreed to pay the Company $300 million in cash upon the
termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances.

Except as expressly set forth in the merger agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement, the
Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the merger is consummated.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
(Page 42)
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that the
Company’s executive officers and directors have economic interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of VWR
stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Board was aware of and

considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger and in reaching
its determination that the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and decision to approve
and declare advisable the merger agreement and the merger. These material interests are summarized below.
 

•  the receipt of payments and benefits by executive officers under individual employment arrangements that were in place prior to the
execution of the merger agreement upon certain types of terminations of employment that may occur in connection with the merger;

•  the full accelerated vesting of VWR equity awards upon the effective time consistent with the terms of the merger agreement;
•  retention bonuses and gross-up payments to be paid by the Company to certain of its executive officers; and
•  continued indemnification rights in favor of directors and officers of the Company.

Financing of the Merger (Page 50)
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Transactions, including the refinancing of our existing indebtedness, will be
approximately $6.6 billion, which will be funded by a combination of preferred equity financing and debt financing, together with available
cash on hand at each of Avantor and, after consummation of the merger, the Company. This amount includes the funds needed to
(1) pay stockholders the amounts due under the merger agreement, (2) make payments in respect of VWR’s outstanding equity-based
awards and existing TRA (as defined in the subsection entitled “The Merger—Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Income Tax Receivable Agreement” beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement), as applicable, pursuant to
the merger agreement and (3) pay all fees and expenses payable by Avantor and Merger Sub under the merger agreement. In
connection with the Transactions, (a) Avantor and Vail Holdco Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Vail Holdco”) and the entity that will be the
direct parent of Avantor (“Issuer”) have obtained preferred equity financing commitments of $2.65 billion from Broad Street Principal
Investments, L.L.C. (“BSPI”), an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and an affiliate of a fund that has been invested in VWR since
prior to its initial public offering and (b) Avantor has obtained debt financing commitments of $7.75 billion from certain debt financing
parties (in each case, pursuant to the terms and conditions as described further under “The Merger—Financing of the Merger” beginning
on page 50 of this proxy statement). The merger is not conditioned on Avantor’s or Merger Sub’s ability to obtain preferred equity
financing or debt financing.

Regulatory Matters (Page 74)
Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until, among other things,
 

•  the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and certain foreign antitrust laws have expired or terminated;
•  the obtainment of any required clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under any applicable foreign antitrust law;
•  the obtainment of required approval by CFIUS, if applicable; and
•  the receipt of written notice of no objections under the FATA or the preclusion of objections by the FATA due to passage of time.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 71)
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of VWR common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Stockholders will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received and the adjusted tax basis of the shares of VWR common stock surrendered. VWR stockholders who are U.S. Holders
(as defined in the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement)
will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the merger. VWR stockholders who are
Non-U.S. Holders (as defined in the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71 of
this proxy statement) will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the merger
unless the stockholder has certain connections to the United States. The tax consequences of the merger to VWR stockholders will
depend upon their particular circumstances. VWR stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax
consequences of the merger to them, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction.

Appraisal Rights (Page 76)
Under Delaware law, if the merger is completed, VWR stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement will
have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of VWR common stock as determined by the Delaware Court

of Chancery, but only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal prior to the vote on the merger agreement, perfect their
appraisal rights by complying with all of the required Delaware law procedures, which are summarized in this proxy statement, and are
entitled to maintain a judicial proceeding for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex D
to this proxy statement. Please read it carefully and in its entirety.

Treatment of Shares of VWR Common Stock and Outstanding Equity Awards
(Page 43)
Stock Options. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, pursuant to the merger agreement and consistent with the terms of VWR’s
2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “company equity plan”), each VWR stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the effective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess of the merger consideration, if any, over the exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such
stock option by (ii) the number of shares of VWR common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time;
provided that any VWR stock option with an exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such stock option that equals or
exceeds the merger consideration will be cancelled without the payment of consideration.

Restricted Stock Units. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, pursuant to the merger agreement and consistent with the terms of
the company equity plan, each restricted stock unit (“RSU”) that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time will
be converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the merger consideration.

Consummation of the Merger
We currently expect the merger to be completed in the third quarter of 2017. However, the Company cannot predict the exact timing of
the consummation of the merger or whether the merger will be consummated at all. In order to consummate the merger, VWR
stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting and the other closing conditions under the merger
agreement, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals, must be satisfied or, to the extent legally permitted, waived.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Questions and Answers About the Merger and the Special Meeting (continued)
 
  
 

Q: How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of VWR common stock?
 

A: The merger consideration of $33.25 per share to be received by VWR stockholders represents:
 

 •  a 17% premium to the unaffected closing price of VWR common stock on May 2, 2017 (the last trading day prior to thepublication of market speculation regarding a potential sale of VWR);
 •  a 20% premium over the 30 trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017; and
 •  a 24% premium over the 90 trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017.

The closing sale price of a share of VWR common stock on NASDAQ on June 12, 2017 was $32.97. You are encouraged to
obtain current market quotations for a share of VWR common stock in connection with voting your shares of VWR common stock.

 
 

Q: When is the merger expected to be completed?
 

A: We currently expect the merger to be completed in the third quarter of 2017. However, the merger is subject to various closingconditions, including VWR stockholder and regulatory approvals, and it is possible that the failure to timely meet these closing
conditions or other factors outside of the Company’s control could delay the completion of the merger. The Company cannot
assure you that it will complete the merger on this schedule or at all.

 
 

Q: When and where will the special meeting be held?
 

A: The special meeting will be held on Thursday, July 13, 2017 starting at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, at The Radnor Hotel,591 E. Lancaster Avenue, St. Davids, Pennsylvania 19087.

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) a proposal to approve, on anadvisory and non-binding basis, specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger and (3) a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary and to
the extent permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the time of the
special meeting, sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement.

 
 

Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed for any reason?
 

A: If the merger is not completed for any reason, VWR stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of VWR commonstock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain a stand-alone public company, and shares of VWR
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Questions and Answers About the Merger and the Special Meeting (continued)
 
  
 

Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on executive compensationthat may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: The approval of the advisory and non-binding proposal on executive compensation that may become payable to the Company’snamed executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote on this
proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Avantor. If the merger agreement is approved by the
stockholders and completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company’s named executive officers even if
stockholders do not approve this proposal.

 
 

Q: Who is entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting?
 

A: The record date for the special meeting is June 12, 2017. If you are the record owner of shares of VWR common stock as of theclose of business on the record date, you are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment of the
special meeting. As of the record date, there were approximately 131,823,770 shares of VWR common stock issued and
outstanding held collectively by approximately two stockholders of record. If you hold your shares of VWR common stock in
“street name” you must obtain and present a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee in order to attend and
vote your shares of VWR common stock in person at the special meeting.

 
 

Q: How many votes are required to adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Under Delaware law, stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock entitled to votethereon must affirmatively vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
 
 

Q: Are there any stockholders who have already committed to vote in favor of the merger?
 

A: Yes. Varietal, which held approximately 34.7% of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock as of June 12, 2017, executedthe Voting and Support Agreement with Avantor and Merger Sub, pursuant to which it agreed, among other things and subject to
certain limitations, to vote the Varietal Securities (as described under “The Special Meeting—Voting and Support Agreement,” on
page 20) in favor of the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement and to grant an irrevocable proxy to Avantor with
respect thereto. See “The Special Meeting—Voting and Support Agreement,” on page 20, for additional information.

 
 

Q: How are votes counted?
 

A: Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed by the Company for the special meeting. For the proposal to adoptthe merger agreement, you may vote “FOR”, “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” If you abstain from voting, fail to submit a proxy,
or if you hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage
firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.
The approval of the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger and, if a quorum is present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company
has not obtained, at the time of the special meeting, sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement,
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. If a quorum is not present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting. If you attend the special meeting in person or by proxy
and abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified
compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting. If you fail to attend the special meeting in person or by proxy, or if you hold your shares
of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it
will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation that
may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Questions and Answers About the Merger and the Special Meeting (continued)
 
  
 

Q: What is a quorum?
 

A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock outstanding and entitled to vote are presentin person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting
may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained in accordance with the merger agreement and the
Company’s amended and restated bylaws.
If you mark, sign, date and return a proxy card (or otherwise properly submit a proxy over the Internet or by telephone) but
abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares of VWR common stock
will be counted for purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares of VWR common stock are held in “street name” by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee and you do
not obtain a proxy from your broker or other nominee and attend the special meeting in person or do not instruct the nominee how
to vote your shares of VWR common stock, these shares of VWR common stock will not be voted at the special meeting, nor will
they be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

 
 

Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the annexes and the otherdocuments referred to in this proxy statement, please vote your shares of VWR common stock as described below. You have one
vote for each share of VWR common stock you own as of the record date.

 
 

Q: How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?
 

A: You may:
 

 •  submit a proxy by telephone by calling 1-800-454-8683 and following the telephone voting instructions printed on yourproxy card;

 •  submit a proxy over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com and following the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxycard;

 •  submit a proxy by marking, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and each additional proxy card you receive fromthe Company and returning each proxy card in its accompanying postage-paid envelope; or
 •  vote your shares of VWR common stock in person by appearing and casting your vote at the special meeting.

If you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on July 12, 2017. If you are submitting a proxy by mail, your completed proxy card must be received no later than
July 12, 2017.

Submitting a proxy by telephone over the Internet, or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person at the special
meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail even if you plan to attend the special
meeting in person, to ensure that your shares of VWR common stock are represented at the special meeting.

If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to have your shares of VWR
common stock voted, your shares of VWR common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
“FOR” the approval of the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to
solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. With respect to any other matter that
properly comes before the special meeting, shares of VWR common stock represented by proxies received by the Company will
be voted with respect to such matter in accordance with the judgment of the persons named as attorneys-in-fact in the proxies.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Questions and Answers About the Merger and the Special Meeting (continued)
 
  
 

Q: How do I vote if my shares of VWR common stock are held by my brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee?
 

A: If your shares of VWR common stock are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then thebrokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to those shares of VWR
common stock. However, you still are considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares of VWR common stock, with your
shares of VWR common stock being held in “street name.” “Street name” holders cannot vote their shares of VWR common stock
directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares of VWR common
stock. Your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of VWR common stock for you
at the special meeting if you instruct it how to vote. Therefore, it is important that you promptly follow the directions provided by
your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct it to vote your shares of VWR common stock. If you
wish to vote your shares of VWR common stock held in “street name” in person at the special meeting, you must obtain, and
present at the special meeting, a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee authorizing you to vote such
shares of VWR common stock at the special meeting. Failure to obtain a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee authorizing you to vote at the special meeting and to instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to
vote your shares of VWR common stock will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement but will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified
compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger or the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger
agreement.
In addition, because any shares of VWR common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different
stockholder than any shares of VWR common stock you hold of record, shares of VWR common stock held in “street name” will
not be combined for voting purposes with shares of VWR common stock you hold of record. To be sure your shares of VWR
common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting, you should instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee on how to vote your shares of VWR common stock held in “street name.”

 
 

Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy?
 

A: If you receive more than one proxy, it means that you hold shares of VWR common stock that are registered in more than oneaccount. For example, if you own your shares of VWR common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your
spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will need to mark, sign, date and return, a
separate proxy card for those shares of VWR common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership.
Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of VWR common stock are voted, you will need to mark, sign, date and return each
proxy card you receive or submit a proxy by telephone or over the Internet for each proxy card you receive by using the different
control number(s) on each proxy card.

 
 

Q: May I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have delivered my proxy?
 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record of shares of VWR common stock, you have the right to change or revoke your proxy beforethe vote is taken at the special meeting:
 

 
•  by delivering to the Company’s Corporate Secretary a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the

date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked and that is received by the Company’s Corporate Secretary no later
than July 12, 2017;

 •  by attending the special meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke yourproxy; you must also vote in person at the special meeting);

 •  by signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares of VWR common stock and bearing a later date andthat is received no later than July 12, 2017; or
 •  by submitting a new proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 12, 2017.

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to me?
 

A: The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of VWR common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transactionfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. You will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of VWR common stock. If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the
section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement), you will
generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the merger. If you are a Non-U.S.
Holder (as defined in the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71 of this
proxy statement), you will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the
merger unless you have certain connections to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to
withhold a portion of your merger consideration under applicable tax laws. The tax consequences of the merger to you will
depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the merger will affect
you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the merger, see “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement.

 
 

Q: What will the holders of VWR stock options and RSUs receive in the merger?
Pursuant to the merger agreement and consistent with the terms of the company equity plan, all equity awards outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be subject to the following treatment, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties:

 

 

•  each VWR stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time will become fully
vested and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the
excess of the merger consideration, if any, over the exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such
stock option by (ii) the number of shares of VWR common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the
effective time; provided that any VWR stock option with an exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying
such stock option that equals or exceeds the merger consideration will be cancelled without the payment of
consideration; and

 •  each RSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into a vested right toreceive cash in an amount equal to the merger consideration.
 
 

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
 

A: If the merger is completed, VWR stockholders who hold their shares of VWR common stock of record and who do not vote infavor of the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting and who also hold their shares of VWR common stock
through the effective date of the merger, will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of VWR common
stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair
value, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, but only if such VWR stockholders submit a written demand
for such an appraisal prior to the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting and otherwise comply with all of the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL necessary to properly perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law, as described
in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 76 of this proxy

 statement. A copy of the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. Failure to strictlycomply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights.
 
 

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
 

A: No. If the merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal with detailed written instructions for exchanging your sharesof VWR common stock for the merger consideration. If your shares of VWR common stock are held in “street name” by your
brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee
as to how to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares of VWR common stock in exchange for the merger consideration.
PLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES AT THIS TIME.

 
 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of VWR common stock before the special meeting?
 

A: The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and theexpected closing date of the merger. If you transfer your shares of VWR common stock after the record date but before the
special meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but will transfer
the right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transferred your shares of VWR common stock.
In addition, if you sell your shares of VWR common stock prior to the special meeting or prior to the effective time, you will not be
eligible to exercise appraisal rights with respect to those shares of VWR common stock in respect of the merger. For a more
detailed discussion of appraisal rights and the requirements for perfecting your appraisal rights, see “Appraisal Rights” beginning
on page 76 and Annex D of this proxy statement.

 
 

Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
 

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to anyhousehold at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the applicable
stockholder provides advance notice and follows certain procedures.

In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the special meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage
firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of shares of VWR common stock held through such firms. If your
family has multiple accounts holding shares of VWR common stock, you may have already received householding notification
from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy
statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral
request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

 
 

Q: Who can answer further questions?
 

A: For additional questions about the merger, assistance in submitting proxies or voting shares of VWR common stock, or to requestadditional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact the Company’s proxy solicitor at:

may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “likely,”
“outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “projection,” “propose,” “seek,” “can,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will,” the negatives thereof
and other words and terms of similar meaning.

Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions; they are not guarantees of performance. You
should not place undue reliance on these statements. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current
expectations and projections about future events. Although the Company believes that its assumptions made in connection with the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot assure you that the assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct; and no
assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking
statements. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to those discussed in the Company’s filings with the
SEC, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 and Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2016 and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, could affect the
Company’s future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in its
forward-looking statements:
 

•  the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement by either
party or result in negative consequences to VWR or VWR stockholders;

•  the Company’s failure to obtain the required vote of its stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, the parties’ failure to obtain any
required regulatory approval, the prohibition of consummating the merger by a court or other governmental authority or the failure to
satisfy any of the other closing conditions to the merger, and delays in connection with the foregoing;

•  Avantor’s failure to obtain the necessary financing arrangements set forth in the debt commitment letter and the preferred equity
commitment letter delivered pursuant to the merger agreement or have the required amount of cash available at closing;

•  risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Avantor a termination fee;
•  risks related to distraction of management due to the substantial commitments of time and resources required for matters relating to

the merger;
•  risks related to the requirements under the merger agreement to operate in the ordinary course of business and refrain from taking

certain actions with respect to business and financial affairs;
•  risks related to the influence on the decisions of the Company’s directors and executive officers regarding support for the merger

based upon interests different from stockholders (including, for example, accelerated vesting and payment for certain stock-based
incentive awards). See “Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this
proxy statement;

•  the effect of the announcement of the merger on the Company’s stock price, on its ability to retain and hire key personnel and on its
ability to maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and employees, and on its operating results and business generally;

•  the fact that, if the merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the
successful execution of the Company’s current strategy as an independent company;

•  the outcome of any litigation related to the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against the Company to
perform the Company’s obligations under the merger agreement; and

•  other risks and uncertainties detailed in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the information contained under the caption
“Risk Factors” herein and information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in tour Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

The Special Meeting
 

Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting
This proxy statement is being furnished to VWR stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company’s officers, directors
and employees for use at the special meeting to be held on Thursday, July 13, 2017 starting at The Radnor Hotel, 591 E. Lancaster
Avenue, St. Davids, Pennsylvania 19087, Eastern Daylight Time, at 11:00 a.m., or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The
purpose of the special meeting is for VWR stockholders to consider and vote on the following:

1. a proposal to adopt the merger agreement;

2. a proposal to approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger; and

3. a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger
agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the time of the special meeting, sufficient affirmative
stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement.

VWR stockholders must adopt the merger agreement in order for the merger to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety.

Record Date and Quorum
Our Board has fixed the close of business on June 12, 2017 as the record date for the purpose of determining the stockholders who are
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. Only holders of record of shares of VWR common stock on the record
date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and at any adjournment or postponement of that meeting
(unless the Board fixes a new record date for stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting in accordance with the merger agreement and the bylaws of the Company). As of June 12, 2017
there were 131,823,770 shares of VWR common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of VWR common stock entitles its
holder to one vote on all matters properly coming before the special meeting.

A majority of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes a
quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals. Shares of VWR common stock held by stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting but not voted, including shares of VWR common stock for which proxies have been duly
executed, dated and received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes
of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business. If a quorum fails to attend the special meeting,
the presiding officer may adjourn the special meeting. See “— Adjournments” below.

Vote Required for Approval
You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST”, or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, each proposal to be considered and voted on at the special
meeting.

Consummation of the merger requires the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of VWR common stock entitled to vote thereon. Therefore, if you abstain or fail to
submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail and otherwise fail to attend the special meeting and cast your vote
on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, or, with respect to shares of VWR common stock you hold in “street name,” if
you fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote
against the adoption of the merger agreement.

The approval of the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger and, if a quorum is present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting
if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the
time of the special meeting, sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement, require the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter. If a quorum is not present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Special Meeting (continued)
 
 
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting. If you attend the special meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from voting, it will
have the same effect as a vote against the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if
necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. If you fail to attend the special meeting in person or by proxy, or if you
hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee, it will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation
that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement.

Voting and Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Varietal, which held approximately 34.7% of the outstanding
shares of VWR common stock as of June 12, 2017 (the “Varietal Securities”), delivered to Avantor and Merger Sub the Voting and
Support Agreement. The form of the Voting and Support Agreement is attached to the proxy statement as Annex B. Pursuant to the
terms of the Voting and Support Agreement, Varietal agreed, among other things, to vote the Varietal Securities in favor of the approval
of the merger agreement and the approval of the Transactions and against (i) any change in the Board, (ii) any takeover proposal (as
described under “The Merger Agreement—VWR Board Recommendation,” beginning on page 60) or any other proposal made in
opposition to the merger agreement or the Transactions, and (iii) any other proposal or action that would constitute a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of VWR under the merger agreement or of Varietal under the
Voting and Support Agreement or that is intended or could reasonably be expected to prevent, frustrate, impede, interfere with,
materially delay or adversely affect the Transactions, in each case subject to the limitations set forth in the Voting and Support
Agreement, and has also granted an irrevocable proxy to Avantor with respect thereto.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Voting and Support Agreement prohibits transfers by Varietal of any of the Varietal Securities prior to
the termination of the Voting and Support Agreement and certain other actions that would impair the ability of Varietal to fulfill its
obligations under the Voting and Support Agreement.

The Voting and Support Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) termination of the merger agreement, (ii) the effective
time, (iii) any change to the merger agreement without the prior written consent of Varietal that reduces any consideration payable to
Varietal or changes the form of consideration payable to Varietal and (iv) the mutual consent of Avantor, Merger Sub and Varietal.

Voting and Proxies
Holders of record of shares of VWR common stock may vote their shares of VWR common stock by attending the special meeting and
voting their shares of VWR common stock in person. Alternatively, you may have your shares of VWR common stock voted in one of the
following three ways, whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting:
 

•  by submitting a proxy by telephone by calling 1-800-454-8683 and following the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy
card;

•  by submitting a proxy over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com and following the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy
card; or

•  by marking, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it in its accompanying postage-paid envelope.

If you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight
Time on July 12, 2017. If you are submitting a proxy by mail, your completed proxy card must be received no later than July 12, 2017.

Submitting a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person at the special meeting. You are
encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail, even if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that
your shares of VWR common stock are represented at the special meeting.

All shares of VWR common stock represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the special meeting will be
voted at the special meeting in the manner specified by the holder. If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Special Meeting (continued)
 
 
do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares of VWR common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, “FOR” the approval on an advisory and non-binding basis, of specified compensation that may become payable to
the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and “FOR” the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. With respect to any other matter
that properly comes before the special meeting, all shares of VWR common stock represented by proxies received by the Company will
be voted with respect to such matter in accordance with the judgment of the persons named as attorneys-in-fact in the proxies.

If your shares of VWR common stock are held in “street name,” you will receive instructions from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or
other nominee that you must follow in order to have your shares of VWR common stock voted. If you have not received such voting
instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee,
as the case may be. Brokers who hold shares of VWR common stock in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares of VWR
common stock typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from
the beneficial owner. However, brokers are not allowed to vote with respect to the approval of matters that are “non-routine,” such as
adoption of the merger agreement, without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes, with respect to any
proposal, are shares of VWR common stock held by a broker or other nominee present in person or represented at a meeting at which
at least one “routine” proposal is presented, but with respect to which the broker or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial
owner of such shares of VWR common stock to vote on the particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power
on such proposal. Because all proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, the Company anticipates that
there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any proposal. If your broker or other nominee holds your shares of VWR
common stock in “street name,” your broker or other nominee will vote your shares of VWR common stock only if you provide
instructions on how to vote. If your broker or other nominee holds your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” and you do not
obtain a proxy from your broker or other nominee to vote such shares of VWR common stock at the special meeting and do not provide
your broker or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of VWR common stock, your shares of VWR common stock will
not count toward the determination of a quorum and this will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the advisory and non-binding proposal on specified
compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting. Please follow the directions on the voting instruction form sent to you by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or
other nominee with this proxy statement.

Revocation of Proxies
Proxies received by the Company before the vote being taken at the special meeting, which have not been revoked or superseded
before being voted, will be voted at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record of shares of VWR common stock, you have
the right to change or revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the special meeting by taking any of the following actions:
 

•  delivering to the Company’s secretary a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that
the proxy is revoked and that is received by the Company’s Corporate Secretary no later than July 12, 2017;

•  attending the special meeting and voting your shares of VWR common stock in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by
itself, revoke your proxy; you must also vote in person at the meeting);

•  signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares of VWR common stock and bearing a date later than the date of the
earlier proxy and that is received no later than July 12, 2017; or

•  submitting a new proxy over the Internet or by telephone by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 12, 2017.

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of any proxies should be addressed to:

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Special Meeting (continued)
 
 
If you are a “street name” holder of shares of VWR common stock, you may change your voting instructions by submitting new voting
instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee in accordance with the instructions provided by your brokerage firm,
bank, trust or other nominee. You must contact your nominee to obtain instructions as to how to change or revoke your prior voting
instructions.

Adjournments
The Company is submitting a proposal for consideration at the special meeting to authorize the named proxies to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, if at the time of the special
meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to adopt the merger agreement. Even though a
quorum may be present at the special meeting, it is possible that the Company may not have received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes to adopt the merger agreement by the time of the special meeting. In that event, the Company would expect to adjourn
the special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies. The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting
for purposes of soliciting additional proxies to obtain the requisite stockholder approval to adopt the merger agreement. Any other
adjournment of the special meeting, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, including an adjournment required because of the
absence of a quorum, would be voted upon pursuant to the discretionary authority granted by the proxies and by those present in
person at the special meeting.

The approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent permitted by
the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the time of the special meeting, sufficient
affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement, requires, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter and, if
a quorum is not present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the special meeting. If you attend the special meeting in person or by proxy
and abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adjourn the special meeting. If you fail to attend the
special meeting in person or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give voting
instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the special meeting.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Properly executed proxies will be voted “FOR”
the adjournment proposal, unless otherwise noted on the proxies. If the special meeting is adjourned and the time for and place of the
reconvened meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, the Company is not required to give notice of the
time and place of the adjourned meeting unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or the Board fixes a new record date for
determining stockholders entitled to receive notice of, or to vote at, the adjourned special meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and the Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. The Company’s directors, officers and
employees may solicit proxies on its behalf in person, by telephone, email or facsimile. These persons will not be paid additional
remuneration for their efforts. The Company has also retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. (“D.F. King”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies at
a fee estimated not to exceed $25,000, plus reasonable expenses. The Company will also request brokers and other fiduciaries to
forward proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of shares of VWR common stock that the brokers and fiduciaries hold of
record. Upon request, the Company will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Company will pay all
expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement, including solicitation expenses. The Company has also agreed to indemnify
D.F. King against liabilities arising out of or relating to the rendering of services by D.F. King in connection with its proxy solicitation
services.

Stockholder List
A list of VWR stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at the Company’s principal executive
offices located at Radnor Corporate Center, Building One, Suite 200, 100 Matsonford Road, Radnor, PA 19087 at least ten days prior to
the date of the special meeting and continuing through the special meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting. The list will also be
available at the special meeting for inspection by any stockholder present at the meeting.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

Proposals Submitted to VWR Stockholders
 

The Merger Agreement Proposal
(Item 1 on the Proxy Card)

The Company is asking its stockholders to adopt the merger agreement that the Company has entered into with Avantor and Merger
Sub. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the merger agreement
carefully and in its entirety.

For a summary and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger agreement and the merger
throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Merger” beginning on page 27 of this
proxy statement and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement.

Under Delaware law, stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock entitled to vote thereon
must affirmatively vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement in order for the Company to complete the merger. If you abstain
from voting, fail to submit a proxy over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or otherwise fail to attend the special meeting and
cast your vote in person or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the
same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The Board unanimously approved and declared the merger advisable, and determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders and unanimously resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the
merger agreement. See “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 32 of this proxy
statement.

The Board unanimously recommends that holders of shares of VWR common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

The Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal
(Item 2 on the Proxy Card)

Pursuant to by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, the Company is required to submit a
proposal to approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger. This proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachutes” (the “named executive
officer merger-related compensation proposal”), gives the VWR stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory and non-binding
basis, on the compensation that the named executive officers may be entitled to receive from the Company that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger. This compensation is summarized in the table and the footnotes thereto under “The Merger—Interests
of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 47 of this proxy
statement.

The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this
proxy statement.

The Board unanimously recommends that the VWR stockholders adopt the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of VWR Corporation hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation to be paid
or become payable by VWR Corporation to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed
in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the section titled “Golden Parachute Compensation”
and the corresponding table and the footnotes thereto.”

The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-
related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Avantor. Accordingly, if the merger
agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the VWR stockholders.

Table of Contents

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Proposals Submitted to VWR Stockholders (continued)
 
 
The above resolution approving, on an advisory and non-binding basis, specified compensation that may become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of VWR
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. If you attend
the special meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the non-binding proposal
on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. If you
fail to attend the special meeting in person or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give
voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the
advisory and non-binding proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger.

The Board unanimously recommends that holders of shares of VWR common stock vote “FOR” the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal.

The Adjournment Proposal
(Item 3 on the Proxy Card)

The Company is asking its stockholders to approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent permitted
by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not obtained, at the time of the special meeting, sufficient
affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement. If the VWR stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, the Company
could adjourn the special meeting, and any adjourned session of the special meeting, and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies.

If, at the special meeting, the number of shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is not sufficient to approve that proposal, the Company may move to adjourn the special
meeting in order to enable the Company’s directors, officers and employees to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the merger
agreement. In that event, the Company will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the proposal to approve the advisory and non-binding
proposal on specified compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the
merger and the adjournment proposal, and not the merger agreement proposal. If a quorum is present, the approval of the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if the
Company has not obtained, at the time of the special meeting, sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement,
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the subject matter. If a quorum is not present, the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of VWR common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting. If you attend the special meeting in person or by proxy and abstain from voting, it will have
the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adjourn the special meeting. If you fail to attend the special meeting in person or by
proxy, fail to submit a proxy over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or otherwise fail to attend the special meeting and cast your vote, or
if you hold your shares of VWR common stock in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or
other nominee, it will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting.

The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting occurring for purposes of soliciting additional proxies
for adoption of the merger agreement proposal in the event that, at the time of the special meeting, the Company has not received a
sufficient number of votes to approve that proposal. The Company retains full authority to the extent set forth in its bylaws and Delaware
law (subject to the terms of the merger agreement) to adjourn the special meeting for any other purpose, or to postpone the special
meeting before it is convened, without the consent of the VWR stockholders.

The Board unanimously recommends that holders of shares of VWR common stock vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

The Merger
 

Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. The following
chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board, members of Company senior management or the
Company’s representatives and other parties.

As a matter of course and in their ongoing effort to enhance stockholder value, the Board and management of VWR (for purposes of this
section, “management”) have regularly reviewed and evaluated the Company’s business plan and strategy, including the review of a
variety of strategic alternatives (including the sale of businesses or assets, or the acquisition of businesses or assets) to take into
account the changing developments, trends, risks and conditions impacting the business and its industry generally. During the process
leading up to VWR’s initial public offering in 2014, representatives of Varietal contacted numerous potential financial and strategic
buyers to assess interest in a sale of VWR by Varietal as an alternative to the initial public offering, and ultimately engaged in detailed
discussions with four potential strategic buyers. None of the contacted parties, however, ultimately expressed interest in pursuing a sale.

These reviews and evaluations of potentially available transactions and strategies are an important factor in the Company’s belief that it
and the Board are knowledgeable about the opportunities for strategic transactions and acquisitions involving companies in its industry
generally and the Company in particular.

From time to time prior to its engagement by VWR to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”), not acting on behalf of VWR and without access to non-public information about
VWR, held discussions with certain third parties as part of its ordinary course investment banking dialogue regarding potential strategic
alternatives involving VWR. VWR understands that, between April 2016 and February 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch investment bankers who
were later retained to advise VWR in connection with the Transactions had participated in such discussions with 16 parties, including
both financial and strategic potential bidders, and that, of this group, initial interest at a value that BofA Merrill Lynch thought would be
acceptable to VWR stockholders was expressed by only one party and a limited partner of such party (together, “Party A”), which was a
potential financial bidder that Varietal had not contacted in 2014.

Over the week of January 9, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch organized introductory meetings during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in
San Francisco among Tim Sullivan and Nick Alexos, members of the Board and managing directors at Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC
(“MDP”), and representatives of Party A, and among certain members of management and representatives of Party A, in order to
discuss Party A’s interest in the Company based on publicly available information.

On the evening of January 9, 2017, representatives of VWR, including management and Mr. Alexos, and representatives of Avantor,
including management and Matt Holt and Andre Moura, managing directors of New Mountain and members of the Avantor board of
directors, met for dinner during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. For several years, VWR and Avantor have shared a distribution
and supply relationship, and the discussion among these representatives covered their ordinary course business relations and the
healthcare markets generally. There was no discussion of a potential strategic transaction involving the companies.

On January 20, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting attended by certain members of management to discuss Party A’s expressed
interest in the Company. The Board discussed with management the need to enter into a nondisclosure and standstill agreement with
Party A.

On January 24, 2017, the Company entered into a nondisclosure agreement with Party A. The nondisclosure agreement contained
customary standstill provisions, which did not prohibit confidential proposals from being made to the Board.

On January 25, 2017, Party A met with management in order to receive certain historical financial information and the annual budget of
the Company and to conduct oral due diligence on such matters as would enable Party A to refine its level of interest in VWR.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
On February 8, 2017, the Company received a non-binding proposal from Party A, in which it offered to acquire all of the Company’s
outstanding shares of common stock (for purposes of this section, “shares”) at a price between $28.00 and $30.00 per share, and
potentially at an even higher price upon completion of its due diligence.

On February 13, 2017, at a special meeting of the Board, the Board determined that it was not prepared to engage in a transaction with
Party A based upon the per share consideration set forth in the proposal. The Board authorized management to consider ways in which
Party A might be convinced to increase the per share consideration in its proposal. A representative of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland &
Ellis”), the Company’s legal advisor, discussed the Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of considering a possible sale of the Company,
including the obligations for directors to inform themselves fully of all relevant facts and to avoid conflicts of interest (and to disclose
promptly any such conflict that should arise), advised that no discussion of employment terms should occur between management and
any potential bidder, reviewed a typical timeline for a transaction should an actionable proposal be presented to the Board and
responded to questions from directors. At the meeting, the Board instructed management to prepare five-year financial projections of the
Company to be shared with Party A and any other interested bidder in order to allow for a full and proper valuation of the Company. Also
at the meeting, the Board authorized the engagement of BofA Merrill Lynch as the Company’s exclusive financial advisor because of
BofA Merrill Lynch’s familiarity with VWR over time and BofA Merrill Lynch’s familiarity with the potential bidder community as a result of
the numerous conversations it held with potentially interested parties between April 2016 and February 2017 (the fact of which had by
then been disclosed to the Board).

On February 14, 2017, Mr. Kraemer, on behalf of the Board, responded to Party A in writing and conveyed its unwillingness to engage in
a transaction at the per share consideration set forth in the proposal, but noted that the Board had instructed the Company’s
management team to consider ways in which it might assist Party A in getting to a value range that could be the basis for further
discussions.

On February 21-22, 2017, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Chicago, Illinois that was attended in part by certain
members of management and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and BofA Merrill Lynch. The Board discussed with management the
preparation of the five-year financial projections and the fact that it would need to have a high degree of confidence in the achievability
of such projections before directing that such projections be shared with BofA Merrill Lynch or any potential bidder. Representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the Board the potential interest level of possible bidders for the Company, including the willingness and
ability of Party A to increase its level of indicative interest and BofA Merrill Lynch’s previous outreach to potential strategic and financial
bidders. The Board then questioned management about certain of the assumptions and sensitivities that management was preparing to
factor into its preliminary preparation of the five-year financial projections.

On March 2, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting attended by certain members of management and representatives of Kirkland &
Ellis and BofA Merrill Lynch. During this meeting, management reviewed its draft five-year projections, and BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed,
among other things, the market’s reaction to the Company’s recent earnings announcement, general market conditions, and its updated
preliminary financial analysis of a potential leveraged buy-out transaction proposed by Party A. Following its thorough review of the five-
year projections and after considering management’s responses to its questions with respect to the projections, the Board directed
management to share such projections with Party A at a meeting subsequently scheduled for March 14, 2017. For more information
about the management projections, see “— Certain Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 35 of this proxy statement.

On March 14, 2017, certain members of management met with Party A in order to discuss the Company’s projections and certain other
due diligence matters.

On March 24, 2017, Party A contacted representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch by telephone and conveyed that it would not increase its
offer price above $30.00 per share, after which Party A ceased communicating with the Company regarding its independent interest in
acquiring the Company.

During the week of March 27, 2017, Messrs. Holt and Moura initiated conversations with Mr. Alexos regarding Avantor’s interest in an
acquisition of the Company. Mr. Alexos provided contact information for Mr. Kraemer for the submission of a proposal by Avantor and
New Mountain, which Messrs. Holt and Moura confirmed would be financed in part through equity capital from one or more third parties.
During that week, Mr. Moura also discussed with Mr. Alexos that Party A had previously initiated discussions and engaged with New
Mountain regarding Party A providing equity financing for a possible strategic business combination of Avantor and the Company.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
On March 30, 2017, the Company received an indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain at a potential acquisition price
of $30.00 per share. Based upon the Board’s discussions at its previous meeting, during which time it had reviewed the proposal from
Party A, Mr. Kraemer informed Avantor and New Mountain that the price per share offered to the Company was not a basis for further
discussions.

On March 31, 2017, the Company received a revised indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain at a potential
acquisition price of $30.00 to $32.00 per share.

On March 31, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting attended by certain members of management and a representative from
Kirkland & Ellis. After discussion of the latest proposal from Avantor and New Mountain, the Board authorized management to enter into
a nondisclosure and standstill agreement with Avantor and New Mountain, organize a meeting among the parties to allow further
discussion of the proposed transaction and share management’s five-year financial projections at such meeting.

On April 2, 2017, the Company entered into a nondisclosure agreement with Avantor and New Mountain. The nondisclosure agreement
contained customary standstill provisions, which did not prohibit confidential proposals from being made to the Board, and allowed for
Avantor to share confidential information about itself to permit the Company to evaluate the potential for synergies and determine
Avantor’s and New Mountain’s ability to finance a purchase price that would be attractive to VWR stockholders. The nondisclosure
agreement also limited Avantor and New Mountain’s ability to communicate about the transaction with potential financing sources other
than those specifically identified and consented to by the Company.

During the week of April 3, 2017, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch discussed with Messrs. Holt and Moura potential equity financing
sources that could facilitate Avantor and New Mountain raising their bid price and, as a result of such discussions, Avantor and New
Mountain requested permission to talk to Party A as a potential equity financing source.

On April 4, 2017, certain members of management met with senior management of Avantor, as well as Mr. Moura and other
representatives of New Mountain, and their respective advisors to discuss various due diligence matters, including high-level operating
data and anticipated synergies. At this meeting, the Company reviewed its five-year projections with Avantor and New Mountain, which
were the same projections as were shared with Party A.

On April 6, 2017, the Company authorized Avantor and New Mountain to contact Party A to discuss the transaction as a potential equity
financing source.

On April 10, 2017, following discussions between representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and New Mountain, the Company received a
further revised indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain reflecting an offer price of $31.00 per share and indicating
that New Mountain was in discussions with Party A to provide equity financing in support of the bid. The indication of interest letter was
accompanied by a highly confident equity commitment letter from Party A describing its support of the transaction and willingness to
provide equity financing in respect of the merger of the Company and Avantor.

Later on April 10, 2017, upon review of the latest offer with BofA Merrill Lynch, Mr. Kraemer informed Avantor and New Mountain that
the offer price was not adequate.

Later on April 10, 2017, the Company received an updated indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain at an acquisition
price of $32.75 per share. Avantor and New Mountain also requested permission, as required by the nondisclosure agreement, to
contact other potential sources of equity financing identified to the Company.

In the morning of April 11, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting attended by certain members of management and representatives
of Kirkland & Ellis and BofA Merrill Lynch. After discussion of the updated indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain,
the Board directed BofA Merrill Lynch to counter with a price of $33.75 per share. Later that afternoon, the Board reconvened
telephonically and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reported that they had relayed to Messrs. Holt and Moura the request to raise
the offer price to $33.75 per share but had not received any response. On behalf of the Company, BofA Merrill Lynch advised Avantor
and New Mountain that, given concerns for confidentiality and the lack of specificity on the transaction, they would not be permitted to
contact additional equity sources, despite Avantor and New Mountain’s continued emphasis of their need for an equity partner.

On April 12, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting attended by certain members of management and representatives of Kirkland &
Ellis and BofA Merrill Lynch. The Board directed Messrs. Sullivan and Alexos to contact Messrs. Holt and Moura to understand Avantor’s
and New Mountain’s approach to obtaining equity and debt financing commitments and to further encourage Avantor and New Mountain
to raise the offer price. The Board authorized Messrs. Sullivan and Alexos to grant

permission to Avantor and New Mountain to contact the other potential sources of equity financing identified to the Company on April 10,
2017. Later that day, Messrs. Sullivan and Alexos contacted representatives of New Mountain by telephone to affirm the requirement to
increase the offer price meaningfully as well as to discuss the proposed equity financing, following which they authorized Avantor and
New Mountain to contact the other potential financing sources identified to the Company in order to obtain equity financing
commitments.

On the morning of April 13, 2017, the Company received an updated indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain
reflecting an increased offer price of $33.25 per share and accompanied by the previously provided highly confident equity commitment
letter from Party A. This offer price represented a 22.1% premium to the closing sale price of VWR common stock on April 12, 2017 of
$27.23, and a 19.7% premium to the volume-weighted average price of VWR common stock over the 30 trading days ending April 12,
2017 of $27.78. The letter also included a requirement for a 30-day exclusivity period during which the Company would not solicit offers
from any other bidder and would deal exclusively with Avantor and New Mountain. Later that day, the Board held a telephonic meeting
attended by certain members of management and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis. Mr. Kraemer described the discussions that had
taken place with New Mountain, including New Mountain’s outreach to additional sources of equity financing and its commitment to
complete due diligence promptly and begin negotiations of a merger agreement. Mr. Kraemer further reported that earlier that day the
Company had received a further revised indication of interest letter from Avantor and New Mountain. The Board then discussed the
terms proposed by Avantor and New Mountain, concluded that an offer price of $33.25 per share did form the basis for negotiations and
that the requested 30-day exclusivity period was acceptable because VWR was not then, and was not reasonably expected during this
period to be, in discussions with any other bidder. The Board directed management to countersign the indication of interest letter and to
negotiate with Avantor and New Mountain a merger agreement based on the terms outlined therein.

On April 16, 2017, an initial draft of the Agreement and Plan of Merger was sent by Kirkland & Ellis, on behalf of the Company, to
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson Thacher”), legal counsel for Avantor and New Mountain. The initial draft of the merger
agreement contemplated, among other things, a 45-day go-shop period during which the Company would be permitted to solicit
alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and a termination fee of 1.5% of the equity value of the Company (based on the offer
price of $33.25 per share) upon termination of the merger agreement prior to the end of the go-shop period or, if after the end of the
go-shop period in connection with a company takeover proposal from an excluded party, 3.0% of such equity value. The initial draft
merger agreement also contemplated that the Company’s largest stockholder, Varietal, would execute an agreement with Avantor in
support of the merger.

On April 18, 2017, the Company granted Avantor, New Mountain and their pre-approved list of potential sources for equity financing
access to an electronic data room to further assist the conduct of due diligence. Representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and Simpson
Thacher also discussed the initial draft of the merger agreement.

During the period between April 19 and April 20, 2017, representatives of the Company, Avantor, New Mountain and Party A and their
respective advisors held several meetings and conference calls to discuss various due diligence matters, including the identification and
quantification of potential synergies.

On April 20, 2017, the Company granted New Mountain permission to disclose the existence of discussions regarding a transaction and
to disclose other pertinent information to potential debt financing sources.

On April 21, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting attended by certain members of management and certain representatives of
Kirkland & Ellis and BofA Merrill Lynch. A representative from BofA Merrill Lynch provided updates on meetings that had taken place
between Avantor, New Mountain and their other potential equity investors as well as the meetings among management, Avantor, New
Mountain and Party A. A representative from Kirkland & Ellis reviewed the sequence for arranging and finalizing terms of financing,
certain aspects of the merger agreement and the expected timing of regulatory filings required in connection with the proposed
transaction based on the then-available information.

Between April 24 and April 28, 2017, management participated in numerous due diligence calls and meetings with, and responded to
numerous due diligence requests from, representatives of Avantor and New Mountain and their advisors and advisors of Party A.

On April 25, Kirkland & Ellis delivered to Simpson Thacher an initial draft of a tender and support agreement between Varietal and
Avantor, which was later converted into a voting and support agreement in connection with the change in the transaction structure from
a two-step tender offer to a one-step merger.

Table of Contents

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
On April 27, 2017, management held due diligence meetings with potential debt financing sources as well as separate meetings with
several potential sources of equity and preferred equity financing, including Party A and BSPI, which was considering a senior preferred
equity investment. Representatives of Avantor and New Mountain also participated in these due diligence meetings.

On April 27, 2017, Simpson Thacher delivered to Kirkland & Ellis a list of issues in the April 16 draft merger agreement that raised
concerns for Avantor and New Mountain and their proposals with respect to these issues. On April 28, 2017, representatives of
Kirkland & Ellis and Simpson Thacher discussed the issues identified on such list and negotiated certain provisions in the merger
agreement, including, among others, the transaction structure (i.e., a one-step merger as opposed to a two-step tender offer and
merger), certain closing conditions, the circumstances under which the Board could change its recommendation to the VWR
stockholders in favor of the proposed transaction, the length and commencement date of the go-shop period, which Avantor and New
Mountain proposed last 20 days after the signing of the merger agreement, the terms on which the merger agreement could be
terminated, and the amount of the proposed termination fees, including Avantor’s proposal that it be reimbursed for expenses under
certain circumstances after termination of the merger agreement, which the Company rejected.

On April 28, 2017, VWR executed its engagement letter with BofA Merrill Lynch to be VWR’s exclusive financial advisor in connection
with the Transactions. In connection with its engagement, BofA Merrill Lynch also provided the Board with disclosure memoranda which
noted that (i) over the past year, BofA Merrill Lynch discussed with certain third parties the Company as a potential strategic/acquisition
opportunity and (ii) BofA Merrill Lynch prepared materials for discussions with Party A (in which employees of BofA Merrill Lynch
currently advising VWR with respect to the Merger participated) that included (x) analyses of implied financial metrics (including
premium to current market price and multiples of EBITDA and earnings per share) in respect of a potential transaction with the Company
at illustrative purchase prices ranging from $32.50 to $40.00 per share and (y) a hypothetical case study illustrating the achievability of a
leveraged buyout of the Company at a price of $35.00 per share and leverage of 7.0x EBITDA, in each case based on publicly available
(street) estimates of the Company’s future financial performance and certain BofA Merrill Lynch extrapolations and adjustments thereto,
together with an analysis of the sensitivity of equity returns to changes in purchase price (using the aforementioned illustrative prices).
These materials, which were prepared by BofA Merrill Lynch in June 2016, did not reflect any information furnished by, or the views of,
the Company or Party A.

In the early morning of April 29, 2017, Simpson Thacher distributed a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland & Ellis. The
Board held a telephonic meeting that afternoon, attended by certain members of management and representatives of Kirkland & Ellis
and BofA Merrill Lynch. A representative from BofA Merrill Lynch provided updates on Avantor and New Mountain’s efforts to arrange
financing for the transaction, as well as on the proposed capital structure of the acquiring entity. The Board conveyed to its financial and
legal advisors its expectation that the commitment letters with respect to the financing of the transaction be as firm as possible. A
representative from Kirkland & Ellis reviewed with the group the status of the merger agreement negotiations, including some of the
more significant provisions that had not yet been agreed, and the expected timing of the regulatory review of the transaction.

Between April 29 and May 4, 2017, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and Simpson Thacher and certain members of the Board and
Avantor and New Mountain continued negotiating and revising the merger agreement, disclosure letter, voting and support agreement
and financing commitment letters. On April 29, 2017, Kirkland & Ellis distributed a revised draft of the merger agreement, which
proposed a go-shop period of 40 days and a reverse termination fee payable by Avantor of $450 million, which represented
approximately 10% of the equity value of the Company based on the offer price of $33.25 per share, and drafts of the merger agreement
continued to be exchanged between April 29 and May 4, 2017. Avantor and the Company ultimately agreed to key terms on the merger
agreement, including (i) a go-shop period of 35 days, (ii) a reverse termination fee payable by Avantor of $300 million, which
represented approximately 6.7% of the equity value of the Company (based on the offer price of $33.25 per share) if the merger
agreement is terminated under certain conditions, and (iii) a termination fee, payable by the Company if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain conditions prior to the end of the go-shop period, of $85 million, which represented approximately 1.9% of such
equity value or, if after the end of the go-shop in connection with a company takeover proposal from an excluded party, $170 million,
which represented approximately 3.8% of such equity value.

On May 2 and 3, 2017, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Radnor, Pennsylvania attended by certain members of
management and in part by representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and BofA Merrill Lynch. During the meeting, a representative of Kirkland &
Ellis discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties in the context of a contemplated sale of control of the Company and

its consideration of other alternatives. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch then reviewed with the Board BofA Merrill Lynch’s financial
analyses of the $33.25 per share price to be received by VWR stockholders and indicated that it was expected that BofA Merrill Lynch
would be in a position to render, at a subsequent Board meeting following the completion of merger negotiations, its oral opinion with
respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to such stockholders. Representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch and Kirkland & Ellis discussed the status of negotiations and advised the Board that Avantor and New Mountain had
confirmed that their due diligence investigation of the Company was complete.

On May 3, 2017, Mr. Moura informed BofA Merrill Lynch that Party A would not be participating in the equity financing and that BSPI
would be providing a preferred equity financing commitment.

Later on May 3, 2017, following the increase in the trading price of VWR common stock above the negotiated merger price following the
publication of market speculation of a sale of VWR to New Mountain, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch contacted Avantor and New
Mountain to press for a further price increase to $33.75 per share but were told that $33.25 per share was the best and final price that
Avantor and New Mountain would offer.

In the evening of May 4, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting to consider the Transactions. Management reported that
negotiations with Avantor and New Mountain regarding the merger had been completed, and a representative of Kirkland & Ellis
described the material terms of the fully negotiated merger agreement and related documents and reviewed once again certain fiduciary
responsibilities of the Board. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of the $33.25 per share
merger consideration and delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 4,
2017, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the
merger consideration to be received by VWR stockholders, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For more information
about the BofA Merrill Lynch opinion and its related financial analyses, see “— Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor” beginning
on page 37 of this proxy statement. The full text of the written opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch is attached to this proxy statement as Annex
C and is incorporated by reference in its entirety in this proxy statement. The Board considered various reasons to approve the merger
agreement (see “— Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 32 of this proxy statement),
including certain countervailing factors. The Board then resolved unanimously to (i) determine that the Transactions are fair and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approve and declare advisable the merger and the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) irrevocably approve for all
purposes, to the extent permitted by law, Avantor, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates not to be subject to any “moratorium,”
“control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “interested shareholder,” “affiliate transaction,” “business combination,” or other antitakeover laws
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to the Company, Avantor, Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates or the merger agreement or the Transactions with respect to any of the foregoing and (iv) recommend that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the merger, for an advisory and non-binding
proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection
with the merger and for a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting of stockholders to solicit additional
proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger agreement. The Board then instructed the representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch to commence the go-shop process on May 5, 2017 by contacting potential additional bidders promptly the next morning.

Later in the evening of May 4, 2017, the parties executed the merger agreement, Avantor delivered executed financing commitment
letters to the Company concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement and Varietal, Avantor and Merger Sub executed the
voting and support agreement concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement. The Company and Avantor issued a joint press
release to announce the execution of the merger agreement before the U.S. stock markets opened on the morning of May 5, 2017.

After the commencement of the “go-shop” period, the Company, with the assistance of its advisors, contacted or responded to inbound
interest from 26 market participants about pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company, including 5 strategic buyers and 21
financial buyers. During the “go-shop” period, none of the potential strategic or financial buyers submitted an alternative proposal.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 

Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger
Recommendation of the Board
The Board has unanimously approved and declared the merger advisable, and determined that the Transactions are fair to and
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the merger
agreement.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the advisory
and non-binding proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of the
Company in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary and to the extent
permitted by the merger agreement, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement
at the time of the special meeting.

Reasons for the Merger
The Board has unanimously (i) determined that the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
merger agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) irrevocably approve for all purposes, to the extent permitted by law,
Avantor, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates not to be subject to any “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “fair price,”
“interested shareholder,” “affiliate transaction,” “business combination,” or other antitakeover laws (including Section 203 of the DGCL)
of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to the Company, Avantor, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or the
merger agreement or the Transactions with respect to any of the foregoing and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of
VWR common stock vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

In connection with its determination to recommend the merger, the Board considered a variety of factors, including without limitation, the
following:
 

•  The current and historical market price per share of VWR common stock, including the market performance of VWR common stock
relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the merger
consideration of $33.25 per share of VWR common stock represents a 17% premium to the unaffected closing price per share of
VWR common stock on May 2, 2017 (the last trading day prior to the publication of market speculation regarding a potential sale of
VWR), a 20% premium over the 30 trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017 and a 24% premium over the 90
trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017;

•  The merger consideration of $33.25 per share of VWR common stock is more favorable to the Company’s stockholders than the
potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including, but not limited to, a merger
with a different buyer, a leveraged recapitalization or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company, acquisitions, dividends,
stock repurchases and the continued operation of the Company on a standalone basis in light of a number of factors, including the
risks and uncertainty associated with those alternatives;

•  In the negotiations between the parties, the merger consideration of $33.25 per share of VWR common stock was the highest price
per share for VWR common stock that Avantor was willing to pay, and the combination of Avantor’s agreement to pay that price, the
market testing that the Company’s financial advisor had done prior to such negotiations, the Company’s “go-shop” rights and the
ability of the Company to engage in negotiations and discussions with respect to unsolicited proposals that are reasonably likely to
lead to superior proposals described below and under “The Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals”
would result in a sale of the Company at the highest price per share for VWR common stock that is reasonably attainable;

•  There were extensive arm’s-length negotiations which, among other things, resulted in an increase in the offered merger
consideration from $30.00 per share of VWR common stock to a final price of $33.25 per share of VWR common stock. Both on
April 11, 2017 and later when the trading price on May 3, 2017 surpassed the negotiated merger price based on the publication of
market speculation of a sale of VWR, representatives of VWR pressed New Mountain and Avantor for a further price increase but
were told that $33.25 is the best and final price that Avantor would offer. The price of $33.25 is also well above the range initially
offered by Party A of $28.00 and $30.00 per share of VWR common stock;

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
•  The Company negotiated for, and secured, the right to conduct a thorough process during the “go-shop” period. During the “go-shop”

period, the Company, with the assistance of its advisors, contacted or responded to inbound interest from 26 market participants
about pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company, including 5 strategic buyers and 21 financial buyers;

•  The timing of the merger and the risk that if the Company did not accept New Mountain and Avantor’s offer at the time it was made,
the Company might not have had another opportunity to do so, particularly if the markets for private and public debt and private equity
fluctuated in a manner that made it more difficult to finance the merger;

•  The Board’s understanding of the Company’s business, assets, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position and
historical and projected financial performance, as well as the business, economic and regulatory environment;

•  The Board’s understanding of developments in the Company’s primary end users, including in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology,
industrial, education, government and healthcare industries, and potential changes to certain of such industries and the Company’s
customer relationships resulting from consolidation;

•  The Board’s understanding of the evolution of the industry due to transactions among the Company’s primary suppliers, and potential
changes in the Company’s relationships with such suppliers that could result from such transaction activity;

•  The all-cash merger consideration, providing the Company’s stockholders with certainty of value and immediate liquidity for their
shares of VWR common stock, especially when viewed against the risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s business,
including the potential for any of the following to occur:

 

 •  a reduction in revenues from and/or less favorable pricing or terms with new and existing customers;
 •  an inability to expand the Company’s customer base in existing or new markets;
 •  an increase in product prices from the Company’s suppliers that the Company is not able to pass through to its customers;

 •  a reduction in research, development or production spending by the Company’s customers, especially those in the biopharmaindustry;
 •  an inability to access additional capital or refinance existing indebtedness;
 •  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
 •  a need to record impairment charges against the Company’s goodwill, other intangible and/or other long-lived assets; and
 •  other risks described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
•  The fact that New Mountain and Avantor did not require management participation in the merger (either via continued employment

with the combined company or the rollover of management’s equity ownership in the Company) as a condition to executing the
merger agreement;

•  The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and related transaction documents, including:

 

•  the Company’s right, subject to certain conditions, for a period of 35 days from the date of the merger agreement, directly or
indirectly to (A) solicit, initiate or encourage any takeover proposal or the making thereof, including by furnishing non-public
information and other access to any party or its representatives pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement provided that
the Company will make available to Avantor any material non-public information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries
furnished to such other party not previously furnished to Avantor, and (B) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any party any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal;

 

•  the Board’s right to terminate the merger agreement in specified circumstances relating to a superior proposal, subject to the
payment of a termination fee of $170 million (which amount is reduced to $85 million under specified circumstances relating to the
“go-shop” period), as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page
68 of this proxy statement;

 •  the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement;

 •  the fact that Avantor and Merger Sub have obtained committed debt financing and preferred equity financing for the merger, aswell as the limited number and nature of the conditions to the debt and preferred equity financing; and

 

•  the right of the Company, in the event of any breach by Avantor or Merger Sub of any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger agreement that gives rise to a failure of Avantor or Merger Sub, as applicable,
to fulfill a closing condition under the merger agreement, to terminate the merger agreement and to receive from Avantor a
termination fee of $300 million, as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses”
beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement.

Table of Contents

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
•  The availability of appraisal rights for the Company’s stockholders who properly exercise their rights under Delaware law, which gives

these stockholders the ability to seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the “fair value” of their shares of VWR common
stock;

•  The likelihood of obtaining the required regulatory approvals;
•  The ability of the Company’s stockholders to obtain value for a portion of the synergies of the combination of the Company with

Avantor through a premium to the market price per share of VWR common stock;
•  The opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, dated May 4, 2017, to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date

of the opinion, to the holders of shares of VWR common stock (other than shares of VWR common stock held in the treasury of the
Company, shares of VWR common stock owned by the Company (excluding any shares of VWR common stock owned by any
subsidiary of the Company), Avantor or Merger Sub) and shares of VWR common stock as to which appraisal rights have been
properly demanded and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) of the merger consideration to be received by such
holders, as more fully described in “Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor;” and

•  The Voting and Support Agreement with Varietal terminates in the event that the merger agreement is terminated, which would permit
Varietal to support a transaction involving a “superior proposal.”

In the course of its deliberations, the Board also identified and considered a number of countervailing factors and risks to the Company
and its stockholders relating to the merger and the Transactions, including:
 

•  If the merger is completed, the Company’s stockholders will no longer hold an interest in the Company and will not participate in any
potential future earnings or growth of the Company;

•  The merger may not be completed for a variety of reasons, including the failure of one or more closing conditions to be satisfied;
•  Although the Board does not believe that the terms of the merger agreement would preclude a person interested in making a superior

proposal from doing so, or preclude the Board from evaluating such a proposal, certain provisions of the merger agreement, including
the provisions providing Avantor matching rights and the termination fee payable by the Company, may have the effect of
discouraging the submission of alternative proposals;

•  The merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business during the pendency of the merger and
these covenants may limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities that may arise or take other actions it may
otherwise wish to take during the pendency of the merger;

•  The directors and executive officers of the Company may have potential interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally, as described under “—Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement;

•  The announcement of the merger may result in distracting shareholder litigation;
•  The merger will have an impact on the Company’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as described under “U.S.

Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement; and
•  Under the merger agreement, the Company is required to pay a termination fee to Avantor if the merger agreement is terminated by

Avantor or the Company, as applicable, under specified circumstances.

The Board concluded that the potentially negative factors associated with the merger and the Transactions were outweighed by the
benefits that it expected the Company’s stockholders would receive as a result of the merger. For the reasons described above, the
Board unanimously concluded that (i) the merger agreement and the Transactions were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders and (ii) the consideration to be paid by Avantor as contemplated by the merger agreement was the
best value reasonably available to the Company’s stockholders.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the
information and factors considered by the Board, but includes the material factors considered by the Board. In view of the variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition,
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.

Portions of this explanation of the Company’s reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking
in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the section entitled “Cautionary Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 

Certain Prospective Financial Information
The Company’s senior management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance or earnings
beyond the then-current fiscal year and is especially wary of making projections for extended earnings periods due to the unpredictability
of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, financial forecasts for the years 2017 through 2022 prepared by management
were made available to the Board, Avantor and Merger Sub in connection with their respective considerations of the merger and to BofA
Merrill Lynch who were authorized to use and rely upon such projections. Such projections are referred to as the VWR management
forecasts in the section “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 37 of this proxy statement. The Company
has included the summary financial projections (the “Projections”) below to give its stockholders access to certain nonpublic information
provided to Avantor, Merger Sub and its financial advisors for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion of the
Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Avantor, Merger Sub or the Board, BofA Merrill Lynch or any other recipient of
this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results. Management prepared only
one set of projections in connection with the consideration of the merger, and the Board instructed management to provide that same set
of projections to both BofA Merrill Lynch and Avantor.

The Company advised the recipients of the Projections that its internal financial forecasts upon which the Projections were based are
subjective in many respects. The Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, including future expansion and acquisition efforts, many of which are
difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond the Company’s control. As a result, there
can be no assurance that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. The
Projections were prepared for internal use and to assist the Board, Avantor and Merger Sub in connection with their respective
considerations of the merger and not with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of
the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of prospective financial information. The Projections included herein have been prepared by or at the direction of, and are
the responsibility of, the Company. KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has not examined or
compiled any of the Projections, and accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The KPMG LLP report included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement, relates to the Company’s historical financial information. It does not extend to the Projections and
should not be read to do so.

The presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” in the Projections is defined as the Company’s net income or loss adjusted for the following
items: (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision or benefit, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) net foreign
currency remeasurement gains or losses relating to financing activities, (v) losses on extinguishment of debt, (vi) equity offering costs,
(vii) charges associated with restructurings and other cost reduction initiatives, (viii) impairment charges, (ix) gains or losses upon
business disposals, (x) share-based compensation expense and (xi) other costs or credits that are either isolated or cannot be expected
to recur with any regularity or predictability.

The presentation of “Adjusted EPS” in the Projections is defined as the Company’s net income, adjusted for certain items, divided by the
Company’s fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding as determined under GAAP. For the purposes of calculating adjusted net
income, the Company’s net income or loss is first adjusted for the following items: (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) net
foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses relating to financing activities, (iii) impairment charges, (iv) losses on extinguishment of
debt, (v) equity offering costs, (vi) income from changes to estimated fair value of contingent consideration and (vii) other costs or credits
that are either isolated or cannot be expected to recur with any regularity or predictability. After those adjustments, the Company then
adds or subtracts an assumed incremental income tax impact on the above noted pre-tax adjustments, using estimated tax rates and
any other tax items that are either isolated or cannot be expected to recur with any regularity or predictability.

Projections of this type are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to factors such as industry performance,
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as changes to the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company, including the factors described under “Cautionary Factors Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” which factors may cause the Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. Since the Projections cover
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Projections do not take into account
any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the Projections set forth
below. No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the information included in the
Projections.

For the foregoing reasons, as well as the basis and assumptions on which the Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific
portions of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such Projections will be an accurate
prediction of future events, and they should not be relied on as such. Except as required by applicable securities laws, the Company
does not intend, and expressly disclaims any responsibility, to update, or otherwise revise the Projections or the specific portions
presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that
any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.

Certain of the measures included in the Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and
non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.
The Company has not prepared a reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures in the projections because no such reconciliation is
available without unreasonable effort due to the variability and complexity of the reconciling items that the Company excludes from such
non-GAAP financial measures.

Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor
VWR has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as VWR’s financial advisor in connection with the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. VWR selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as VWR’s financial advisor in connection with the
merger on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch’s experience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community
and its familiarity with VWR and its business.

On May 4, 2017, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the merger, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which
was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 4, 2017, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and
subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of
VWR common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch’s written opinion to the Board, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this document
and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its opinion to the Board for the benefit and use
of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a
financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and no opinion or view
was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available
to VWR or in which VWR might engage or as to the underlying business decision of VWR to proceed with or effect the merger.
BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed merger or any related matter.

In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch, among other things:
 
(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to VWR;
 
(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of VWR

furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of VWR, including certain financial forecasts relating to VWR
prepared by the management of VWR (for purposes of this section, “VWR management forecasts”);

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
(iii) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of VWR with members of senior

management of VWR;
 
(iv) reviewed the trading history for VWR common stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of other

companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 
(v) compared certain financial and stock market information of VWR with similar information of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch

deemed relevant;
 
(vi) compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Merrill

Lynch deemed relevant;
 
(vii) considered the results of BofA Merrill Lynch’s efforts on behalf of VWR to solicit, at the direction of VWR, indications of interest

from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of VWR;
 
(viii) reviewed drafts (a) dated May 4, 2017, of the merger agreement, (b) dated May 4, 2017, of the debt commitment letter (as defined

herein) (c) dated May 4, 2017, of the preferred equity commitment letter (as defined herein), and (d) dated May 3, 2017, of the
Voting and Support Agreement (for purposes of this section, such debt commitment letter, preferred equity commitment letter and
Voting and Support Agreement, together with the merger agreement, the “Transaction Agreements,” and such drafts, the “Draft
Transaction Agreements”); and

 
(ix) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch deemed

appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness
of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied
upon the assurances of the management of VWR that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information
or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the VWR management forecasts, BofA Merrill Lynch was
advised by VWR, and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good
faith judgments of the management of VWR as to the future financial performance of VWR. BofA Merrill Lynch did not make and was not
provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of VWR, nor did it make any
physical inspection of the properties or assets of VWR. BofA Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of VWR, Avantor or
any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed,
at the direction of VWR, that the merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory
and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture
requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on VWR or the contemplated
benefits of the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of VWR, that the final executed Transaction Agreements would
not differ in any material respect from the Draft Transaction Agreements reviewed by it.

BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other than the merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any related
transactions or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the merger or
otherwise. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of VWR common stock and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration
received in connection with the merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In
addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect
of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the
merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison
to other strategies or transactions that might be available to VWR or in which VWR might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of VWR to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and
BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction of VWR, upon the assessments of representatives of VWR regarding, legal, regulatory,
accounting, tax and similar matters relating to VWR or the merger, as to which matters BofA Merrill Lynch understood that VWR
obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or
recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the merger or any related matter.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 
BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as
in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that
subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Merrill Lynch.
Except as described in this summary, VWR imposed no other limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA
Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

The discussion set forth below in the section entitled “VWR Financial Analyses” represents a brief summary of the material financial
analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the Board in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill
Lynch, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. Considering the data set forth in the tables below
without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill
Lynch.

VWR Financial Analyses
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for
VWR and the following seven publicly traded companies in the specialty pharmaceutical distribution and life science tools industries:
 
•  Henry Schein, Inc.
•  Patterson Companies, Inc.
•  Agilent Technologies, Inc.
•  Becton, Dickinson and Company
•  Danaher Corporation
•  PerkinElmer, Inc.
•  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as equity
values based on closing stock prices on May 4, 2017, plus debt and minority interests and less cash, as a multiple of calendar year 2017
estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-
based compensation expense. The observed multiples ranged from 11.8x to 16.6x. BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed per share equity
values, based on closing stock prices on May 4, 2017, of the selected publicly traded companies as a multiple of calendar year 2017
estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to as EPS, adjusted to reflect stock-based compensation expense and to exclude
amortization. The observed multiples ranged from 18.5x to 25.7x. The low to high adjusted EBITDA multiples and adjusted EPS
multiples for VWR in the two-year period ended on May 2, 2017 were 10.2x to 12.3x and 13.2x to 18.5x, respectively. BofA Merrill Lynch
then applied calendar year 2017 adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.2x to 12.3x derived from the selected publicly traded companies
(including VWR) to VWR’s calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted EBITDA and applied calendar year 2017 adjusted EPS multiples of
13.5x to 18.5x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to VWR’s calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted EPS. Estimated
financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated
financial data of VWR were based on the VWR management forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per
share equity value reference ranges for VWR, as compared to the merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for VWR   Consideration
2017E Adjusted EBITDA   2017E Adjusted EPS     

$24.25—$32.25   $25.25—$34.50   $33.25

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to VWR. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is
not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which VWR was
compared.

The Merger (continued)
 
 
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to
the following 15 selected transactions involving companies in the distribution/specialty distribution industry and life science tools
industry:
 
Date Announced   Acquiror   Target
06/05/15   •    Cardinal Health, Inc.   •    The Harvard Drug Group
05/04/15   •    Patterson Companies, Inc.   •    Animal Health International, Inc.
01/12/15   •    AmerisourceBergen Corporation   •    MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc.
08/05/14   •    Walgreen Co.   •    Alliance Boots GmbH (55%)
07/17/14   •    GTCR   •    Cole-Parmer Instrument Company
10/23/13   •    McKesson Corporation   •    Celesio AG
02/14/13   •    Cardinal Health, Inc.   •    AssuraMed, Inc.
10/25/12   •    McKesson Corporation   •    PSS World Medical, Inc.
06/19/12   •    Walgreen Co.   •    Alliance Boots GmbH (45%)
09/22/14   •    Merck KGaA   •    Sigma-Aldrich Corporation
04/15/13   •    Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.   •    Life Technologies Corporation
02/07/11   •    Danaher Corporation   •    Beckman Coulter Inc.
02/28/10   •    Merck KGaA   •    Millipore Corporation
05/02/07   •    Madison Dearborn Partners   •    VWR International, Inc.
02/16/04   •    Clayton, Dubilier & Rice   •    VWR International, Inc.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed transaction value, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company based on the
consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s last twelve months EBITDA. The observed
multiples ranged from 7.4x to 19.8x. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied last twelve months EBITDA multiples of 11.0x to 14.5x, derived from
the selected transactions and based on BofA Merrill Lynch’s professional judgment and experience, to VWR’s last twelve months actual
EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly
available information. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for VWR, as
compared to the merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value
Reference Ranges for VWR   Consideration

LTM Adjusted EBITDA     
$25.00—$37.25   $33.25

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to VWR or the merger. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other
values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which VWR and the merger were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of VWR to calculate the estimated
present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that VWR was forecasted to generate from the second fiscal quarter
of 2017 through fiscal year 2022 based on the VWR management forecasts. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for VWR by
applying terminal multiples of 10.5x to 12.5x, which range was selected based on BofA Merrill Lynch’s professional judgment and
experience, to VWR’s estimated fiscal year 2022 adjusted EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present
value as of March 31, 2017 using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 9.25%, which were based on an estimate of VWR’s weighted
average cost of capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for VWR as
compared to the merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value
Reference Range for VWR   Consideration

$30.00—$41.00   $33.25

Other Factors
BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s material financial analyses
with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
 
•  historical trading prices per share of VWR common stock during the 52-week period ended May 2, 2017, which ranged between

$24.75 and $31.32; and
•  one-year forward analyst price targets discounted by one year at VWR’s estimated midpoint cost of equity of 10.5%, which ranged

between $25.25 and $31.75.

Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “VWR Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial
analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all
analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is
a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and
the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA
Merrill Lynch further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been
referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to
in the summary.

In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of VWR. The estimates of the future performance of VWR in or underlying BofA Merrill
Lynch’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of
BofA Merrill Lynch’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of VWR common stock of the merger
consideration to be received by such holders and were provided to the Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch’s
opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at
which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations
resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be
BofA Merrill Lynch’s view of the actual values of VWR.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between the parties, rather than by
any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Board. As
described above, BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of
the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to the merger or
the merger consideration.

VWR has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be
approximately $30 million, $2 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent
upon consummation of the merger. VWR also has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with BofA Merrill Lynch’s engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any controlling person of BofA Merrill Lynch and
each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the
federal securities laws.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and
derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate
and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and
products to a wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Merrill Lynch and
its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions,
finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of VWR, and certain of its affiliates (including MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio
companies) and Avantor and certain of its affiliates (including New Mountain and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies).

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to VWR and certain of its affiliates, including MDP and certain of its affiliates and
portfolio companies, and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including
(i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to certain affiliates of VWR, including certain affiliates and portfolio companies of MDP, in
connection with certain M&A transactions, (ii) having acted or acting as a book-running manager and/or underwriter for certain debt and
equity offerings of VWR and certain of its affiliates, including certain affiliates and portfolio

companies of MDP, (iii) having acted or acting as a bookrunner and/or manager for certain block trades by MDP of shares of VWR
common stock, (iv) having acted as a dealer manager for a debt tender offer of an affiliate and portfolio company of MDP, (v) having
acted or acting as an administrative agent, collateral agent, bookrunner and arranger for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans,
letters of credit, credit facilities and other credit arrangements of VWR and/or certain of its affiliates, including MDP and/or certain of its
affiliates and portfolio companies (including acquisition financing), (vi) having provided or providing certain trading services to VWR
and/or certain of its affiliates, including MDP and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, (vii) having provided or providing
certain managed investments services and products to VWR and/or certain of its affiliates, including MDP and/or certain of its affiliates
and portfolio companies and (viii) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to VWR and/or
certain of its affiliates, including MDP and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies. From May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2017,
BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from VWR and its affiliates, including MDP and its affiliates and portfolio
companies, of approximately $44 million for investment and corporate banking services.

In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide,
investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Avantor and certain of its affiliates, including New Mountain and
certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these
services, including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to certain affiliates of Avantor, including New Mountain and/or certain of
its affiliates and portfolio companies, in connection with certain M&A transactions, (ii) having acted or acting as a book-running manager
and/or underwriter for certain debt and equity offerings of certain affiliates of Avantor, including certain affiliates and portfolio companies
of New Mountain, (iii) having acted or acting as an administrative agent, collateral agent, bookrunner and/or arranger for, and/or as a
lender under, certain term loans, letters of credit, credit and leasing facilities and other credit arrangements of Avantor and/or certain of
its affiliates, including New Mountain and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies (including acquisition financing), (iv) having
provided or providing certain derivatives, foreign exchange and other trading services to Avantor and/or certain of its affiliates, including
New Mountain and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, (v) having provided or providing certain managed investments
services and products to Avantor and/or certain of its affiliates, including New Mountain and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio
companies, and (vi) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Avantor and/or certain of its
affiliates, including New Mountain and/or certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies. From May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2017, BofA
Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Avantor and its affiliates, including New Mountain and its affiliates and
portfolio companies, of approximately $17  million for investment and corporate banking services.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that the
Company’s executive officers and directors have economic interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of VWR
stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Board was aware of and considered these
interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger and in reaching its decision to
determine that the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, approve and declare
advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and consummation of the merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in the merger agreement and recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote for a proposal
to adopt the merger agreement, for an advisory and non-binding proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable
to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and for a proposal to approve one or more adjournments
of the special meeting of stockholders to solicit additional proxies, if necessary and to the extent permitted by the merger
agreement. These material interests are summarized below.
 
•  the receipt of payments and benefits by executive officers under individual employment arrangements that were in place prior to the

execution of the merger agreement upon certain types of terminations of employment that may occur in connection with the merger;
•  the full accelerated vesting of VWR equity awards upon the effective time consistent with the terms of the merger agreement;
•  retention bonuses and gross-up payments to be paid by the Company to certain of its executive officers; and
•  continued indemnification rights in favor of directors and officers of the Company.

Treatment of Shares of VWR Common Stock and Outstanding Equity Awards
With respect to shares of VWR common stock that the Company’s directors and executive officers beneficially own, the Company’s
directors and executive officers will receive the same cash consideration per share of VWR common stock on the same terms and
conditions as the other VWR stockholders.

VWR equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will generally be subject to the following treatment, unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties:
 
•  each VWR stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time will become fully vested and will be

cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the merger
consideration, if any, over the exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such stock option by (ii) the number of
shares of VWR common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time; provided that any VWR stock
option with an exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such stock option that equals or exceeds the merger
consideration will be cancelled without the payment of consideration; and

•  each RSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into a vested right to receive cash
in an amount equal to the merger consideration.

Holders of VWR equity awards at the effective time will cease to have any rights with respect to such awards other than the rights to
receive the payments described above.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 

Severance Provisions of Employment Arrangements
Each of the Company’s executive officers other than Mr. Kepper is entitled to certain severance benefits pursuant to his employment
agreement or employment letter (each, an “employment arrangement”), the material terms of which are described below. Mr. Kepper is
eligible for certain severance benefits as required under German law.

The employment arrangements provide that upon a termination of employment by the Company without cause or a resignation by the
executive for good reason, the executive officers are entitled to certain benefits and payments. In the case of Messrs. Brocke-Benz,
Cowan, McLoughlin, Clausnitzer, Van Kula, Christian and Pitts, the executive is entitled to one and a half times (or two times, in the case
of Mr. Brocke-Benz) the sum of base salary then in effect and target bonus for the year in which such termination occurs, payable over
12 months and continued health benefits for a period of twelve months (or 18 months, in the case of Mr. Brocke-Benz) after such
termination.

For purposes of each employment agreement or employment letter, as applicable, “cause” means any of the following: (i) the conviction
of a felony or the commission of fraud with respect to VWR or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their customers or suppliers,
(ii) substantial and repeated failure to perform duties as reasonably directed by the Board or a supervisor or report, after providing 15
days’ prior written notice and a reasonable opportunity to remedy such failure and (iii) gross negligence or willful misconduct with
respect to VWR or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. “Cause” will be deemed not to include any act or failure to act, unless it is done, or
omitted to be done, in bad faith or without reasonable belief that an employee’s action or omission was in the best interests of VWR or
any of its respective affiliates. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a direction from the Board or based upon
the advice of counsel for VWR or any of its respective affiliates will be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good
faith and in the best interests of VWR and its affiliates. In the case of Messrs. Cowan, McLoughlin, Clausnitzer, Van Kula, Christian and
Pitts, cessation of employment will not be deemed to be for cause unless and until (i) there will have been delivered to the employee a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the entire membership of the Board (excluding for this
purpose any seat on the Board then held by such employee, if applicable) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose
(after reasonable notice is provided and such employee is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board),
finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, that cause exists for the termination of employment, and specifying the particulars
thereof in reasonable detail and (ii) if capable of cure within 30 days, such employee will be given 30 days from the date of the meeting
of the Board at which opportunity was given, together with counsel, to be heard by the Board to cure the conduct specified by the Board.
At any such Board meeting, an employee will be automatically recused from participation in such meeting as a member of the Board, if
applicable.

For purposes of each employment agreement or employment letter, as applicable, “good reason” means VWR materially changes the
authority, titles, reporting rights or obligations, and/or duties of the employee in a manner inconsistent with the position currently held or
as described in the such agreement or letter, as applicable, (ii) VWR fails to make any payment to, or provide an employee with any
benefit, required to be paid or provided pursuant to such agreement or letter, as applicable, (iii) VWR reduces the base salary and/or
bonus entitlement of an employee described in such agreement or letter, as applicable, (iv) in the case of Messrs. Cowan, McLoughlin,
Clausnitzer, Van Kula, Christian and Pitts, a relocation of the principal place of employment to a location that increases commuting
distance by more than 25 miles, except for travel on company business or (v) any successor to the business of VWR fails to assume
VWR’s obligations under such agreement or letter, as applicable; provided that, in order for a resignation for Good Reason to be
effective, written notice of the occurrence of any event that constitutes good reason must be delivered by the employee to VWR within
180 days after such employee has actual knowledge of the occurrence of any such event and the occurrence of such event is not cured
by VWR within 10 days after the date of such written notice to VWR.

Retention Bonus Arrangements
The Company has established management retention programs (“retention programs”) covering each of its executive officers that
provide for a bonus in a fixed amount (the “retention bonus”), between $500,000 and $5,000,000, as well as excise tax gross-up
payments (as described below). The Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) believes that the retention
bonuses will provide appropriate retention incentives that will enable the Company to continue to benefit from the services of the
Company’s management.

Under the retention programs if (i) a named executive officer is employed by the Company or its affiliates (including, without limitation,
Avantor and any affiliate of Avantor) on (x) May 4, 2018 if the closing date has occurred before such date or (y) if the closing date has
not occurred on or before May 4, 2018, the earlier of the closing date or December 31, 2018 (the “vesting

date”) or (ii) the named executive officer’s employment with the Company and its affiliates is terminated before the vesting date (A) by
the Company for a reason other than cause, (B) by the named executive officer for good reason or (C) due to the named executive
officer’s death or disability, a retention bonus will be paid in a cash lump sum to such named executive officer within 10 days of the
vesting date. The right to receive a retention bonus would be forfeited upon any other termination of employment with the Company and
its affiliates. The retention bonuses and excise tax gross-up payments payable to each of our named executive officers are summarized
in the table and the footnotes thereto under “—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement. The
maximum aggregate compensation payable under the retention bonuses to the Company’s executive officers will not exceed
$13.25 million, exclusive of any excise tax gross-up payments that may be required.

Each of Greg Cowan, Mark McLoughlin, George Van Kula, Manuel Brocke-Benz, Doug Pitts and Gerry Christian (the “affected
individuals”) may be subject to an excise tax (the “golden parachute excise tax”) on payments they will or may receive in connection with
the Transactions under Section 4999 of the Code. Generally, an excise tax of 20% is imposed on each individual recipient of certain
“parachute payments” that, under the rules of Section 280G of the Code, exceed a certain threshold amount for such individual.
Additionally, the employer of the executive making the parachute payments is denied a tax deduction for such payments. The golden
parachute excise tax is due in addition to the regular income and employment taxes otherwise payable in connection with compensatory
payments to the affected individuals. Payments to these executive officers that will or may be considered “parachute payments” under
Section 280G of the Code that would be subject to the golden parachute excise tax include (i) the value of the full acceleration of vesting
of VWR stock options and RSUs, (ii) the retention bonuses, (iii) the excise tax gross-up payments and (iv) the severance payments.

The Compensation Committee has considered the impact of the potential golden parachute excise tax on the affected individuals and
has determined that the imposition of the excise tax on them would result in a significant personal tax burden that would deprive the
affected individuals of a substantial portion of the value of their compensatory payments in connection with the Transactions. The
Compensation Committee has assessed the costs and benefits of making gross-up payments to alleviate the effect of the golden
parachute excise tax on the affected individuals to VWR, its stockholders, the surviving corporation and each of the affected individuals.
The Board, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, determined that it was in the best interests of VWR’s stockholders
to mitigate the negative tax impact to the affected individuals that would otherwise result from the Transactions, which are expected to
bring significant financial benefits to VWR’s stockholders. Upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved
that the retention bonuses payable pursuant to the gross-up management retention program, which includes each of the affected
individuals, also provide for the payment of an additional bonus in an amount so that, on a net after-tax basis, the affected individuals
would be in the same position as if no golden parachute excise tax had applied to him or her (the “excise tax gross-up payment”).

The actual amounts to be paid to the affected individuals by VWR will depend upon the value and timing of the affected individual’s
receipt of the implicated payments and benefits, with any excise tax gross-up payment that becomes due to be paid not later than the
sixtieth day following an event occurring which subjects the affected individual to the golden parachute excise tax.

Interests in Varietal
Messrs. Brocke-Benz, Christian, Cowan, Kepper, McLoughlin, Pitts, Van Kula, Kraemer, Barchi, Blechschmidt, DeCresce, and Zollars
and Ms. Forbes Lieberman are investors in Varietal. None of the foregoing persons has direct or indirect voting or dispositive power with
respect to the shares of VWR common stock held of record by Varietal. Following completion of the merger, Varietal is expected to
liquidate, in which case the members would receive their pro rata portion of the merger consideration and TRA payment (as described
further under “—Income Tax Receivable Agreement” beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement).

New Management Arrangements
Prior to the effective date of the merger, some or all of the Company’s executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements,
arrangements or understandings with Avantor or its affiliates regarding the executive officers’ continuing employment or compensation
and benefits, including equity incentive arrangements, on a going-forward basis following completion of the merger. Other than as
described below, no such new agreements, arrangements or understandings have been entered into as of the date of this proxy
statement.

Following discussions which commenced in early June, it is expected that Mr. Cowan will become Chief Financial Officer of the
combined company effective at the closing of the merger. In connection with Mr. Cowan’s assumption of this role, it is expected

that following completion of the merger the terms of his current employment arrangement will remain in place, except that:
(i) Mr. Cowan’s base salary will be increased by 5% on January 1, 2018 and again on January 1, 2019, (ii) Mr. Cowan’s annual bonus
will be guaranteed at 100% of target for 2018, paid quarterly, and will be guaranteed at 50% of target thereafter, in each case, subject to
possible upward adjustment, (iii) Mr. Cowan’s retention bonus will be modified such that, if the closing of the merger occurs prior to
May 4, 2018, he will receive 50% of the retention bonus upon the closing, and 50% on May 4, 2018, (iv) Mr. Cowan (A) will be entitled to
full severance payments upon any termination (1) by the combined company other than for cause or (2) due to death or disability and
(B) after June 30, 2018, will also be entitled to full severance payments upon a termination by Mr. Cowan, provided he gives six months’
prior written notice after such date, (v) Mr. Cowan will be entitled to a housing allowance of $1,500 per month, and (vi) Mr. Cowan will be
entitled to a gross-up payment to the extent that any payments under his employment arrangement trigger excise taxes.

Golden Parachute Compensation
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each of the Company’s
named executive officers, who are Messrs. Brocke-Benz, Cowan, McLoughlin, Clausnitzer and Van Kula, that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules. The
amounts set forth in the table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions
described in this proxy statement and in the footnotes to the table. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, that a named executive officer
will receive may materially differ from the amounts set forth in the table.

The table below assumes that (i) the effective time will occur on September 30, 2017, (ii) the employment of the named executive officer
will be terminated on such date in a manner entitling the named executive officer to receive severance payments and benefits under the
terms of the named executive officer’s employment arrangement, (iii) the named executive officer’s base salary remains unchanged
from those in place as of May 4, 2017, (iv) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants or exercises any VWR stock
options on or prior to the effective time, (v) the named executive officer will be entitled to the amounts payable under the applicable
retention program and (vi) no named executive officer enters into new agreements or is otherwise legally entitled to, prior to the effective
time, additional compensation or benefits. For a narrative description of the terms and conditions applicable to the payments quantified
in the table below, see “—Treatment of Shares of VWR Common Stock and Outstanding Equity Awards” and “—Severance and Change
in Control Provisions of Employment Arrangements” above.

(2) This amount represents the aggregate in-the-money value of the VWR stock options and RSUs that would vest as a direct result of the merger. This

accelerated vesting is “single trigger,” and will take place upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the company equity plan, regardless
of whether the named executive officer’s employment is terminated. This amount will become payable immediately upon the closing of the merger. For
information regarding equity acceleration upon a change in control, see “—Summary of Estimated Equity Awards”. These amounts do not include
payments in respect of VWR stock options or RSUs that already vested, because the named executive officer would already be entitled to the
economic benefit of such equity regardless of the transaction. For information regarding all equity, including that which has already vested, see “—
Summary of Estimated Equity Awards”.

(3)Upon termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason,” Messrs. Cowan, McLoughlin and Van Kula are generally entitled to continued health
benefits for the 12-month period, or for the 18-month period in the case of Mr. Brocke-Benz, following termination and Dr. Clausnitzer will be entitled to
receive health benefits in accordance with applicable German law. These benefits are “double trigger” in nature, which means that such payments are
conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment, or in the case of retention bonuses, the additional conditions described above in
“— Retention Bonus Arrangements,” as opposed to “single trigger” payments, which are solely conditioned upon the consummation of the merger.

(4)These amounts include, for each of the named executive officers (other than Dr. Clausnitzer), a tax gross-up payment to make such named executive
officer whole, on an after-tax basis, for any taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code payable no later than the sixtieth day
following an event occurring which subjects such named executive officer to such taxes, subject to certain conditions and exceptions as set forth in the
retention programs. Additionally, Mr. Brocke-Benz’s Executive Officer Employment Agreement provides that in the event excise taxes become payable
under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of any “excess parachute payments,” as that phrase is defined by the
Internal Revenue Service, upon a change of control of the Company, VWR will pay the excise tax as well as a gross-up for the impact of the excise tax
payment.

(5)These amounts are payable to the named executive officers pursuant to the retention programs as described above in “—Retention Bonus
Arrangements.”

As partial consideration for the potential payments provided in the tables above, the named executive officers are bound by a
confidentiality agreement as well as customary non-compete and non-solicitation provisions set forth in their respective employment
arrangements. The non-compete provisions prohibit the named executive officers from engaging in or being affiliated with certain large
companies in the lab supplies industries that the Company competes with while employed by the Company and for a period of one year,
or eighteen (18) months in the case of Mr. Brocke-Benz, after the termination of such employment for any reason. The non-solicitation
provision prohibits the named executive officer, either alone or in association with others, while employed by the Company and for a
period of eighteen (18) months after the termination of such employment for any reason, from soliciting any of the Company’s business
relations from doing business with the Company and from soliciting any employees to leave the employ of the Company unless such
individual’s employment has been terminated for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or longer. The named executive officer’s
receipt of the payments would be contingent upon such named executive officer signing a release of claims against us.

Employee Benefits
Pursuant to the merger agreement, Avantor has agreed that for a period of not less than one year following the effective time, Avantor
will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior to the effective time, is an employee of
the Company and its subsidiaries and who continues employment with Avantor following such effective time (i) salary and incentive
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate (excluding any value attributable to equity-based compensation)
than those provided to such employee by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the closing date of the merger and
(ii) employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension plan benefits) that are no less favorable

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the merger agreement, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the effective time (and right to advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any person who is or prior to the effective time
becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each,
an “indemnified party”) as provided in the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Company’s amended and
restated bylaws the organizational documents of any subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement listed in the
Company disclosure letter between such indemnified party and the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is in effect as of the date of
the merger agreement (i) will be assumed by the surviving corporation in the merger, without further action, at the effective time, (ii) will
survive the merger, (iii) will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such
indemnified party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iv) for a period of six years following the date of the merger agreement will
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such indemnified
party. Avantor will ensure that the surviving corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

After the effective time, in the event of certain threatened or actual legal proceedings, whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that at or prior to the effective time the indemnified party
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to a Company benefit plan) of the Company, its
subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, whether in any case asserted or claimed before or after the effective time, Avantor
and the surviving corporation will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the
Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the Company’s amended and restated bylaws (or the corresponding
organizational documents of the applicable subsidiary of the Company provided that if such documents provide for a lesser degree of
indemnification than as is provided in the Company’s organizational documents, such indemnified party will be indemnified and held
harmless as and to the fullest extent provided in the Company’s organizational documents as if they instead applied), each such
indemnified party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses.

Avantor and the surviving corporation will cooperate with each indemnified party in the defense of any matter for which such indemnified
party could seek indemnification hereunder. Avantor’s and the surviving corporation’s obligations relating to the foregoing paragraph will
continue in full force and effect for the period beginning upon the effective time until six years from the effective time, provided that all
rights to indemnification in respect of certain legal proceedings asserted or made within such period will continue until the final
disposition of such proceeding.

The Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and fully pay the premium for, for the benefit of the past and present officers and
directors of the Company, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
effective time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of the merger agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the effective time and ending six years from the effective time, covering each
indemnified party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to
deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any indemnified party than the existing D&O
policies; provided that the maximum aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance policies does not exceed
300% of the aggregate annual premium for coverage for its current fiscal year under the existing D&O policies.

In the event that (i) Avantor or the surviving corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (y) consolidates with or merges
into any other party and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (z) transfers or conveys
all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any party or (ii) Avantor or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the
surviving corporation, then, and in each such case, Avantor will cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors
and assigns or transferees assume the obligations described above.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger (continued)
 
 

Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Transactions, including the refinancing of our existing indebtedness, will be
approximately $6.6 billion, which will be funded by a combination of preferred equity financing and debt financing (together, the
“financing”), as described below, together with available cash on hand at each of Avantor and, after consummation of the merger, the
Company. This amount includes the funds needed to (1) pay Company stockholders the amounts due under the merger agreement,
(2) make payments in respect of the Company’s outstanding equity-based awards and existing TRA (as defined in the subsection
entitled “— Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Income Tax Receivable Agreement” beginning
on page 52 of this proxy statement), as applicable, pursuant to the merger agreement and (3) pay all fees and expenses payable by
Avantor and Merger Sub under the merger agreement (the foregoing clauses (1) through (3), along with the funds necessary to
refinance Avantor’s, Merger Sub’s and certain of their affiliates’ existing indebtedness, the “required amount”). The merger is not
conditioned on Avantor’s or Merger Sub’s ability to obtain preferred equity financing or debt financing.

Avantor and Merger Sub are required under the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions described in each of the commitment letters (as defined in the subsections entitled “— Preferred
Equity Financing” below and “— Debt Financing” beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement). In the event any portion of the financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the commitment letters for any reason, Avantor is required under the
merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to complete the merger and
the other Transactions and pay the required amount. As of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, each of
the commitment letters remain in effect, and Avantor has not notified us of any plans to utilize alternative financing. The documentation
governing the financing contemplated by each of the commitment letters has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the
financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.

Preferred Equity Financing
On May 4, 2017, Avantor and Issuer entered into a commitment letter (the “preferred equity commitment letter”) with BSPI, pursuant to
which (a) BSPI committed to Avantor and Issuer to purchase from Issuer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
preferred equity commitment letter (i) 100% of the initial aggregate liquidation preference of $2 billion of a single class of series A senior
preferred stock of Issuer having the terms and conditions set forth in the preferred equity commitment letter for an aggregate cash
purchase price of $2 billion (the “senior preferred stock”) and (ii) shares of a single class of series A junior convertible preferred stock of
Issuer having the terms and conditions set forth in the preferred equity commitment letter for an aggregate cash purchase price of $650
million (the “junior preferred stock”) and (b) Issuer committed to issue to BSPI detachable penny warrants for the purchase of the Class
A common stock of Issuer in an aggregate amount equal to $100 million having the terms and conditions set forth in the preferred equity
commitment letter (the “warrants” and, together with the senior preferred stock and the junior preferred stock, the “preferred equity”).
The issuance of the preferred equity is subject to various conditions precedent, including, without limitation, the following (subject to
certain exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the preferred equity commitment letter):
 
•  the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the merger agreement) since the date of the merger agreement;
•  the prior or substantially concurrent consummation of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement;

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

The Merger Agreement
 

The summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which the Company
incorporates by reference into this document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information
about the merger agreement that is important to you. The Company encourages you to read the merger agreement carefully in its
entirety.

The Merger
The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with the
DGCL, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and, as a result of the merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation. As the surviving corporation,
the Company will possess the rights, powers, privileges, immunities and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware law.

The closing date of the merger (the “closing date”) will be on the second business day following the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement and described under “— Conditions to the Merger” below (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
on the closing date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions on the closing date), provided that, notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the Company, Avantor and Merger Sub will not be required to
effect the closing of the merger until the earlier of (i) a business day during the marketing period specified by Avantor on no less than
two business days’ prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the second business day following the final day of the marketing period
(subject in each case to the satisfaction of conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than any conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied on the closing date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions on the closing date)).

The merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such other time as Avantor and the Company agree and specify in the certificate of merger (the “effective time”).

The Merger Consideration and the Conversion of Capital Stock
At the effective time, by virtue of the merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any of the outstanding shares of VWR
common stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, each share of VWR common stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive $33.25 in cash and without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding taxes, other than:
 

•  each share of VWR common stock that is owned by the Company (other than shares of VWR common stock that are owned by any
subsidiary of the Company, which will remain outstanding), Avantor or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will no
longer be outstanding and will be automatically canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor; and

•  shares of VWR common stock that are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
of VWR common stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“dissenting shares”).

VWR stock options, RSUs and restricted stock will be treated as described under “— VWR Stock Options, RSUs and Restricted Stock”
beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement.

Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation and will
thereafter constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Payment Procedures
Prior to the effective time, Avantor will select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for
the payment of the merger consideration to former holders of shares of VWR common stock. Avantor will, or will cause

The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 
the surviving corporation to, deposit with the paying agent, substantially simultaneously with the effective time, cash necessary to pay for
the shares of VWR common stock converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

As promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time (but in no event later than two business days after the effective time), the
surviving corporation or Avantor will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the
effective time represented outstanding shares of VWR common stock that were converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates will
pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the paying agent, and will be in such form and have such other provisions as are
customary and reasonably acceptable to the Company and Avantor) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in
exchange for the merger consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate to the paying agent for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the paying agent, the holder of such certificate
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of VWR common stock theretofore represented
by such certificate are converted pursuant to the merger agreement and the certificate so surrendered will be cancelled.

A holder of shares of VWR common stock in book-entry form will, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in
customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the paying agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and the surviving
corporation or Avantor will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time (but
in no event later than two business days thereafter), an amount equal to the aggregate merger consideration to which such holder is
entitled thereunder and such shares of VWR common stock will be canceled.

If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains undistributed one year after the closing date, such cash will be delivered to Avantor
or its designated affiliate, upon demand, and any former holder of shares of VWR common stock entitled to payment of the merger
consideration who had not theretofore complied with the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Avantor or its
successor-in-interest for payment of its claim for the merger consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws).

If any certificate for shares of VWR common stock is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Avantor may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such certificate, the paying agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the applicable merger consideration
to be paid in respect of the shares of VWR common stock formerly represented by such certificate.

VWR Representations and Warranties
The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by the Company to Avantor and Merger Sub and representations
and warranties made by Avantor and Merger Sub to the Company. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties
are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger
agreement, including information contained in a confidential disclosure letter provided by the Company to Avantor and Merger Sub in
connection with the signing of the merger agreement (the “Company disclosure letter”). The Company disclosure letter contains
information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the merger
agreement. Furthermore, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any particular date
because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to public disclosures to
stockholders. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the merger agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk
between the Company, Merger Sub and Avantor rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the
representations and warranties in the merger agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company, Merger
Sub or Avantor. This description of the representations and warranties is included to provide VWR stockholders with additional
information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company,
Avantor or Merger Sub.

In the merger agreement, the Company has made representations and warranties to Avantor and Merger Sub with respect to, among
other things:
 

•  the due organization, valid existence, and good standing of the Company and its subsidiaries;
•  its capitalization, including in particular the number of outstanding shares of VWR common stock, RSUs, and the number of shares of

VWR common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options;

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 
•  the vote of the VWR stockholders required to approve the merger;
•  the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the merger agreement and consummate the Transactions;
•  the absence of conflicts with laws, the Company’s organizational documents and contracts to which the Company or any of its

subsidiaries is a party;
•  the required consents and approvals of governmental authorities in connection with the Transactions;
•  its SEC filings, including the financial statements contained in such filings and internal controls;
•  the absence of certain undisclosed liabilities;
•  the accuracy and compliance with applicable laws of the information supplied by the Company contained in this proxy statement;
•  the conduct of its business and the absence of certain changes, except as contemplated by the merger agreement, including that

since December 31, 2016, there has been no change, event, circumstance, effect or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would be reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company;

•  tax matters;
•  labor and employment matters;
•  matters related to the Company’s benefit plans;
•  title to properties and the absence of liens;
•  matters with respect to certain of the Company’s contracts;

•  the inapplicability of state takeover statutes to the merger;
•  the receipt by the Board of a fairness opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated; and
•  the absence of any material product recall.

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by the Company are qualified by a “materiality” or “material
adverse effect on the Company” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or
correct, individually or in the aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or have a material adverse effect on the Company). For
purposes of the merger agreement, a “Company material adverse effect” generally refers to any change, event, circumstance, effect or
occurrence that (i) has, or would be reasonably expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, condition (financial
or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) prevents or materially delays the
consummation of the merger and the other Transactions or the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the merger
agreement in any material respect.

However, the standard of “material adverse effect on the Company” generally excludes any adverse effect to the extent resulting from or
arising out of:
 

•  general conditions in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate;
•  general economic or regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, in

each case in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere in the world in which the Company or its subsidiaries operate;
•  any change or prospective change in applicable law or GAAP (or interpretation or enforcement thereof);
•  any changes after the date of the merger agreement in geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any acts or

threats of war (whether or not declared), sabotage, terrorism or any epidemics, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts or
threat of war (whether or not declared), sabotage, terrorism or any epidemics;

•  any hurricane, tornado, flood, volcano, earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster or any other national or international
calamity or crises;

earnings or other financial or operating metrics before, on or after the date of this Agreement, or changes or prospective changes in
the market price or trading volume of shares of VWR common stock or the credit rating of the Company;

•  the execution, announcement and pendency of any of the Transactions, including any legal proceeding in respect of the merger
agreement or the Transactions;

on behalf of the Company) against the Company or the Board relating to, in connection with or arising out of the merger or the other

with any customer, supplier, vendor, service provider, collaboration partner or any other business partner, or departure of any
employee or officer, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

•  any action taken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries at Avantor’s written request or with Avantor’s written consent or the failure
to take any action by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the extent that Avantor fails to give its consent after receipt of a written
request therefor if (a) that action is prohibited by the merger agreement and (b) had such action been taken, no Company material
adverse effect would have occurred;

•  the identity of Avantor, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates; and
•  except as to the items set forth in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth bullet points above, to the extent that the Company and its

subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are disproportionately affected thereby as compared with other participants in the industries in which
the Company and its subsidiaries operate (in which case only the incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company material adverse effect), subject to certain restrictions.

In the merger agreement, Avantor and Merger Sub made customary representations and warranties to the Company with respect to,
among other things:
 

•  the due organization, valid existence, good standing, power and authority of Avantor and Merger Sub;
•  the capitalization and interim operations of Merger Sub;

statement;

Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand;

•  the foreign person status of Avantor and Merger Sub’s investors.

merger agreement will not survive the effective time. This limit does not apply to any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its
terms contemplates performance after the effective time.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 

Go-Shop; No-Solicitation; Competing Takeover Proposals
Under the merger agreement, the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers and other representatives are
permitted to, among other things, until the go-shop period end-date:
 
•  directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage any takeover proposal or the making thereof, including by way of furnishing

non-public information and other access to any person or its representatives pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement
provided that prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such other person (and in any event within 24 hours),
the Company will make available to Avantor any material non-public information with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries
furnished to such other person not previously furnished to Avantor; and

•  directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to,
or take any other action to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
takeover proposal.

With respect to any person other than an excluded party, beginning on the date immediately following the go-shop period end-date, the
Company, its subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers will not, and the Company will direct its and its subsidiaries’ other
representatives not to:
 
•  directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to or that would

reasonably be expected to lead to, or the submission of, any takeover proposal;
•  execute or enter into any agreement or understanding with respect to any takeover proposal;
•  directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any party any information with respect to, or

take any other action to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
takeover proposal;

•  take any action to make the provisions of any applicable law or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
the Company’s organizational documents inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a takeover proposal; or

•  authorize, commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, beginning on the date immediately following the go-shop period end-date, the
Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, except with respect to any excluded party,
immediately:
 

•  cease all communications, solicitations, discussions and negotiations regarding any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a takeover proposal or otherwise in connection with a takeover proposal or potential
takeover proposal;

•  request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any party within the last six months for
the purposes of evaluating a possible takeover proposal; and

•  terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible takeover proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, prior to obtaining the company requisite vote and after the
go-shop period end-date, in response to a qualifying company takeover proposal and the failure to take any such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may:
 
•  furnish non-public information and other access to the party making such qualifying company takeover proposal and its

representatives pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement so long as the Company also provides Avantor, in accordance
with the terms of its confidentiality agreement and substantially concurrently with the time such information or access is provided to
such party (and in any event within 24 hours), any material non-public information or access with respect to the Company or its
subsidiaries furnished to such other party that was not previously furnished to Avantor; and

•  enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with such party and its representatives regarding such qualifying
company takeover proposal, including soliciting, encouraging and facilitating the making of a revised qualifying company takeover
proposal.

Within two business days after the go-shop period end date, the Company must deliver to Avantor a written notice setting forth the
identity of any excluded party and each other party or group (other than Avantor and its subsidiaries) that, to the knowledge of the
Company, has (or is expected to have) a material equity interest in the takeover proposal proposed by such excluded party and the
material terms and conditions of the pending takeover proposal made by such excluded party (including any material terms proposed
orally or supplementary thereto and any material modifications thereto), and the Company must deliver to

Avantor copies of any takeover proposal made in writing and all proposed definitive documents (including financing commitments)
received by the Company or any of its representatives from any such excluded party or its representatives relating to any takeover
proposal.

VWR Board Recommendation
Subject to the provisions described below, the Board has unanimously recommended that VWR stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting (the “board recommendation”). The Board also agreed to
include the board recommendation in this proxy statement. Subject to the provisions described below, the merger agreement provides
that neither the Board nor any committee of the Board will:
 

•  withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Avantor or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Avantor or Merger Sub, the board recommendation;

•  approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any takeover proposal;
•  fail to publicly reaffirm, up to a maximum of two times (provided that, Avantor will be entitled to an additional two such reaffirmations

for each intervening event or publicly announced change to any material term of a takeover proposal), the board recommendation
within five business days after Avantor so requests in writing (or such fewer number of days as remain prior to the special meeting, as
it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with the merger agreement);

•  fail to recommend in a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 rejection of a takeover proposal that is a tender
offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (other than by Parent and its affiliates) within ten (10)
business days of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (or such fewer number of days as remain prior to the
special meeting, as it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with the merger agreement);

•  resolve, publicly announce an intention or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (each such foregoing action, an “adverse
recommendation change”); or

•  approve or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement providing for any takeover
proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the merger agreement), or resolve,
agree or publicly propose to take any such action.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, at any time prior to, but not after, the company requisite
vote has been obtained (x) the Board may, in response to an intervening event, take or fail to take certain of the actions specified in the
clauses above relating to the definition of adverse recommendation change (an “intervening event adverse recommendation change”) if
the Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) if the Board receives a superior company proposal, the
Company may terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such superior company proposal;
provided that concurrently with such termination the Company pays any required termination fee; and provided that, prior to so making
an intervening event adverse recommendation change or so terminating the merger agreement:
 
•  the Company materially complies with certain provisions of the merger agreement;
•  the Board gives Avantor at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the

reasons for taking such action (which notice, in respect of a superior company proposal, will specify in writing the identity of the party
or parties who made such superior company proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of such superior company proposal
and attach the most current version of the relevant transaction agreement and other material definitive documents (including financing
commitments));

•  the Company negotiates, and causes its representatives to negotiate in good faith, with Avantor during such notice period, to the
extent Avantor wishes to negotiate, to enable Avantor to revise the terms of the merger agreement in such a manner that would
eliminate the need for taking such action (and in respect of a superior company proposal, would cause such superior company
proposal to no longer constitute a superior company proposal);

•  following the end of such notice period, the Board considers in good faith any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement offered
in writing by Avantor, and determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to effect such intervening event
adverse recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement to accept such superior company proposal would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and, with respect to a superior company proposal,
that such superior company proposal continues to constitute a superior company proposal; and

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 
•  in the event of any material change to any of the terms or conditions of such superior company proposal, the Company, in each case,

delivers to Avantor an additional notice consistent with that described above and a renewed notice period will commence (except that
the four business day notice period will instead be equal to two business days) during which time the Company will be required to
comply with the foregoing requirements anew with respect to such additional notice.

An “excluded party” is any person or group (other than Avantor and its subsidiaries) from which the Company received prior to the
go-shop period end-date a written takeover proposal that: (a) remains pending as of, and has not been withdrawn on or prior to, the
go-shop period end date and (b) the Board determines, in good faith, on or prior to the go-shop period end date, after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior company proposal; provided
that any party will cease to be an excluded party (i) at such time following the go-shop period end date that the takeover proposal
submitted by such party is withdrawn or terminated (it being understood that any amendment, modification or replacement of such
takeover proposal will not, in and of itself, be deemed a withdrawal of such takeover proposal) or (ii) if such party’s takeover proposal is
not so withdrawn or terminated as of the go-shop period end date, then on the tenth business day following the go-shop period end date
if the Board has not made an adverse recommendation change or given Avantor written notice of its intention to take such action, in
each case as a result of such party’s takeover proposal.

An “intervening event” is a material event, change, effect, development, circumstance or occurrence that improves or would be
reasonably likely to improve the business, financial condition or continuing results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, that (i) is not known by the Company or the Board as of the date of the merger agreement and that was not
reasonably foreseeable as of the date of the merger agreement and (ii) does not relate to a takeover proposal, provided that in no event
will the following constitute, or be taken into account in determining the existence of an intervening event: (x) the fact that the Company
meets or exceeds any internal or published forecasts or projections for any period, or any changes after the date of the merger
agreement in the market price or trading volume of shares of VWR common stock, (y) the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the
announcement of the merger agreement or the Transactions or (z) any event, fact or circumstance relating to or involving Avantor or its
subsidiaries.

A “superior company proposal” is any written bona fide takeover proposal received after the date of the merger agreement that if
consummated would result in a party or group (or the stockholders of any party) owning, directly or indirectly, (i) 50% or more of the
aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity or (ii) 50% or more (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board) of the assets
(including capital stock of the Company’s subsidiaries) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which the
Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor, are (x) reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with such terms and (y) more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
than the Transactions, taking into account all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects (including timing and certainty of
closing) of such takeover proposal and of the merger agreement.

A “takeover proposal” is any inquiry, proposal or offer from any party or group (other than Avantor and its subsidiaries) relating to (i) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of (y) more than 20% of the assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (z) more than 20% of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the
Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company that, if consummated, would result in any party or group (or the
stockholders of any party) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of
the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in
each case, the Transactions.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, the merger agreement does not prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, including making any
“stop-look-and-listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that, subject to certain exceptions, no action contemplated hereby
will constitute an adverse recommendation change.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 

VWR Stock Options, RSUs and Restricted Stock
VWR equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be subject to the following treatment;
 

•  each VWR stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not exercisable or
vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess (if any) of
the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such stock option by (ii) the number of
shares of VWR common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time; provided that any VWR stock
option with an exercise price per share of VWR common stock underlying such stock option that equals or exceeds the merger
consideration will be cancelled without the payment of consideration;

•  each RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the merger consideration; and

•  each share of restricted stock which is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will at the effective time be converted into a
vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the merger consideration.

Holders of VWR equity awards at the effective time will cease to have any rights with respect to such awards other than the rights to
receive the payments described above.

VWR Employee Compensation and Benefits
For a period of one year following the effective time (the “continuation period”), Avantor will provide or cause the surviving corporation to
provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time and who continues
employment with Avantor, the surviving corporation or any of the Company’s subsidiaries (each, a “continuing employee”) (i) salary and
incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate (excluding any value attributable to equity-based
compensation) than those provided to such continuing employee by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective
time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension plan benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such continuing employee by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time.

Following the continuation period, to the extent that any of the existing Company benefit plans are discontinued, each continuing
employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all plans maintained by Avantor, the surviving
corporation or their respective affiliates (the “surviving corporation plans”) to the extent coverage under any such plan is necessary to
replace coverage under the discontinued Company benefit plan in which such continuing employee participates immediately prior to the
effective time.

From and after the closing date, Avantor will or will cause the surviving corporation to assume, honor and continue during the
continuation period or, if later, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company’s employment, severance,
retention, termination and change in control plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control
severance agreement or other Company benefit agreement between the Company and any continuing employee) maintained by the
Company or its subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the closing date, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the Transactions.

With respect to all surviving corporation plans, each continuing employee’s service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (as well
as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer
was recognized by the Company or such subsidiary) will be treated as service with Avantor or any of their respective subsidiaries;
provided that such service need not be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service or (ii) with respect to any benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan.

With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Avantor or any of its subsidiaries in which any continuing employee is eligible to
participate after the effective time, Avantor will, and will cause the surviving corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived,
satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company benefit
plan in which such employees participated immediately prior to the effective time and

The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 
(ii) provide continuing employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the effective time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable under
any such plan, in each case, except to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits.

Other Covenants and Agreements
Access to Information; Confidentiality. Except if prohibited by applicable law, the Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to,
afford to Avantor and Avantor’s representatives reasonable access during normal business hours (under the supervision of appropriate
personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries) during the period prior to the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms to all their respective properties, books and records, contracts and personnel (subject to, in certain circumstances, consent of the
chief executive officer or general counsel of the Company as described below) and, during such period, the Company will, and will
cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish, reasonably promptly, to Avantor all information in its possession concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Avantor may reasonably request, subject to certain exceptions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to afford access or furnish information to
the extent (i) such information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (ii) such information relates to the
applicable portions of the minutes of the meetings of the Board (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the
Board) where the Board discussed the Transactions or any similar transaction involving the sale of the Company to, or combination of
the Company with, any other party or (iii) the Company determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, violate applicable law or result in
significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable (provided that the Company will cooperate with Avantor
in seeking, and use reasonable best efforts to secure any consent or waiver or other arrangement to allow disclosure of such information
in a manner that would not result in such violation, contravention, prejudice, or loss of privilege).

Prior to the effective time, other than in the ordinary course of their respective businesses and not in connection with the Transactions,
Avantor, Merger Sub and their representatives may only contact and communicate with the personnel, customers, service providers,
regulators, vendors and suppliers of the Company and its subsidiaries related to the Transactions after prior consultation with and the
written consent of the chief executive officer or general counsel of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance. Pursuant to the merger agreement, all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any person who is or prior to the effective time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement, a
director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an “indemnified party”) as provided in the Company’s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, the Company’s amended and restated bylaws, the organizational documents of any subsidiary of the
Company or any indemnification agreement listed in the Company disclosure letter between such indemnified party and the Company or
any of its subsidiaries that is in effect as of the date of the merger agreement (i) will be assumed by the surviving corporation in the
merger, without further action, at the effective time, (ii) will survive the merger, (iii) will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms with respect to any claims against any such indemnified party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iv) for a period of six
years following the date of the merger agreement will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such indemnified party. Avantor will ensure that the surviving corporation complies with and
honors the foregoing obligations.

After the effective time, in the event of certain threatened or actual legal proceedings, whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that at or prior to the effective time the indemnified party
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to a Company benefit plan) of the Company, its
subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, whether in any case asserted or claimed before or after the effective time, Avantor
and the surviving corporation will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the
Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the Company’s amended and restated bylaws (or the corresponding
organizational documents of the applicable subsidiary of the Company provided that if

such documents provide for a lesser degree of indemnification than as is provided in the Company’s organizational documents, such
indemnified party will be indemnified and held harmless as and to the fullest extent provided in the Company’s organizational documents
as if they instead applied), each such indemnified party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses.

Avantor and the surviving corporation will cooperate with each indemnified party in the defense of any matter for which such indemnified
party could seek indemnification hereunder. Avantor’s and the surviving corporation’s obligations relating to the foregoing paragraph will
continue in full force and effect for the period beginning upon the effective time until six years from the effective time, provided that all
rights to indemnification in respect of certain legal proceedings asserted or made within such period will continue until the final
disposition of such proceeding.

The Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and fully pay the premium for, for the benefit of the past and present officers and
directors of the Company, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
effective time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of the merger agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the effective time and ending six years from the effective time, covering each
indemnified party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to
deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any indemnified party than the existing D&O
policies; provided that the maximum aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance policies does not exceed
300% of the aggregate annual premium for coverage for its current fiscal year under the existing D&O policies.

In the event that (i) Avantor or the surviving corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (y) consolidates with or merges
into any other party and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (z) transfers or conveys
all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any party or (ii) Avantor or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the
surviving corporation, then, and in each such case, Avantor will cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors
and assigns or transferees assume the obligations described above.

Public Announcements. Avantor and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the merger and the other Transactions, and will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national or foreign securities exchange and except as contemplated, permitted or required by the merger agreement.

Stockholder Litigation. Until the termination of the merger agreement, the Company will provide Avantor an opportunity to participate in
the defense, settlement and prosecution of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to any of the
Transactions (the “transaction litigation”) and consult with Avantor with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any
transaction litigation, including the opportunity to review and to propose comments to all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any transaction litigation, and the Company will give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments proposed by Avantor. In no event will the Company enter into, agree to or disclose any settlement with respect to such
transaction litigation without Avantor’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except to the
extent such settlement is fully covered by the Company’s insurance policies (other than any applicable deductible), but only if such
settlement would not result in the imposition of any material restriction on the business or operations of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates.

Works Councils. The Company and its subsidiaries will comply in all material respects with all notification, consultation and other
processes with respect to any works council, economic committee, union or similar body as required by applicable law to effectuate the
Transactions, which may include any required notifications and consultation and other processes with respect to any works council,
economic committee, union or similar body.

Financing Efforts. Avantor and Merger Sub will, and will cause their subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to obtain financing
on the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the commitment letters, including using their reasonable best efforts to

debt commitment letter) and subject only to the conditions contained in the commitment letters so that such agreements are in effect on

consummation of the merger is required to occur, (iv) enforce their rights under the commitment letters and (v) comply with and maintain

issue, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under the indenture to issue, a conditional notice of optional redemption for
some or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the existing notes. The Company will assist Avantor upon reasonable
request in making arrangements for redemption, defeasance, satisfaction and/or discharge of the existing notes pursuant to the
indenture.

Reasonable Best Efforts
Each of the parties to the merger agreement must use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers and consents from, the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings with and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid certain legal proceedings by any governmental entity
with respect to the merger agreement or the Transactions, (ii) the defending or contesting of certain legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other governmental entity vacated or reversed and (iii) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement.

In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Board must use reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no anti-takeover law or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions or the merger
agreement and (ii) if any anti-takeover law or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Transactions or the merger
agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by the merger agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and the
merger agreement.

Avantor and the Company must, in consultation and cooperation with the other, (i) file with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the “FTC”) and the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) the Notification and Report Form, if any, required under the HSR
Act for the merger or any of the other Transactions as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 20 business days after the date
of the merger agreement), (ii) make all necessary filings as required under the FATA as promptly as practicable, (iii) make all appropriate
filings, notices, applications or similar documents required under any applicable foreign antitrust law as promptly as practicable and (iv) if
(x) a filing is formally or informally requested by CFIUS, (y) within 70 days of the date of the merger agreement, Avantor or the Company
determines a CFIUS filing is advisable related to the Transactions or (z) an investigation by CFIUS is commenced for any other reason,
then, in each case, the parties hereto must as soon as practicable submit to CFIUS a draft of a joint voluntary notice of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (the “CFIUS notice”).

Each of Avantor and the Company must (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
party may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, the FATA,
Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (as codified at 50 U.S.C. § 4565) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DOD 5220.22-M (January 1995), and any
supplements, amendments or revised editions thereof (the “NISPOM”), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) or any
applicable foreign antitrust law, (ii) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such filings or

additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ, the U.S. State Department Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”), CFIUS, the

discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other party in connection with, any such
filings, submissions, substantive communications, substantive inquiries or requests, provided that such materials may be redacted (x) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company or other competitively sensitive information; (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements or applicable law; and (z) as necessary to address reasonable confidentiality concerns, (iii) unless
prohibited by applicable law or by the applicable governmental entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (v) not participate in or
attend any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any governmental entity in respect of the merger or any of the other
Transactions without the other party, (w) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (x) in the
event one party is prohibited by applicable law or by the applicable governmental entity from participating in or attending any such
meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect thereto, (y) cooperate in the filing of any
substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending the merger
agreement, the merger or any of the other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or
objections made by any governmental entity and (z) furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective representatives,
on the one hand, and any governmental entity or members of any governmental entity’s staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
merger agreement, the merger and the other Transactions and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, CFIUS, DSS,
DDTC, the DOJ or any other governmental entity as promptly as reasonably practicable. Avantor agrees not to extend, directly or
indirectly, any waiting period under applicable antitrust laws or enter into any agreement with a governmental entity to delay or not
consummate the merger or any of the other Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may not
be unreasonably withheld (provided such extension does not go beyond the outside date).

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Avantor and Merger Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to
avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under any applicable
antitrust law or the FATA that may be required by any governmental entity and required approvals by CFIUS and DSS, so as to enable
the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the outside date), including committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate, divestiture or other
disposition of assets or businesses of Avantor or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing,
modifying or waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Avantor or Company or
their respective subsidiaries, (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Avantor or
the Company or their respective subsidiaries, and (iv) accepting all such requirements, mitigation measures, or conditions as may be
requested or required by CFIUS, DSS or any other governmental entity as necessary or advisable in connection with, or as a condition
of, the receipt of the required approvals by CFIUS and DSS (each a “remedial action”); provided that the Company will not be obligated
to agree to, commit or effect, any remedial action unless such remedial action is conditioned upon, or will occur subsequent to,
consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions and such
litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Avantor will take any and all action, including a remedial action, to avoid or resolve any such
litigation, action or proceeding and each of the Company, Avantor and Merger Sub will cooperate with each other and use its reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the outside date). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in the merger agreement will require or obligate Avantor and Merger Sub or any of their affiliates to take any remedial
action with respect to Avantor, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, if any such remedial
action individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, assets, liabilities, businesses or results of operations of Avantor, the Company and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

The Merger Agreement (continued)
 
 
Neither Avantor nor Merger Sub will, nor will they permit their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any
rights, assets, business, entity or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such
acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining (i) any applicable clearance, consent, approval
or waiver under any applicable antitrust law or the FATA or (ii) required approvals by CFIUS and DSS with respect to the Transactions.

As soon as practicable, Avantor and the Company will submit to DSS and, to the extent applicable, any other governmental entity,
notification of the Transactions pursuant to the NISPOM and any other applicable national security or industrial security regulations, and
submit and request approval of measures to mitigate foreign ownership, control or influence arising as a result of the merger and the
other Transactions. Each of Avantor and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to finally and successfully obtain required
approvals by CFIUS and DSS as promptly as practicable.

As soon as possible, but in no event later than twenty business days after the merger agreement, Avantor will prepare and file with
DDTC a notice of the Transactions as required under the ITAR, 22 CFR 122.4(b). Each of Avantor and the Company will use reasonable
best efforts to respond promptly to any inquiries received from DDTC for additional information or documentation, and to respond
promptly to all inquiries and requests from DDTC in connection with such notice.

as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent any
such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date), other than for
such failures to be true and correct that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
material adverse effect;

•  the fundamental representations and warranties of the Company relating to (i) organization, standing and power, (ii) authority,
execution and delivery and enforceability, (iii) fees of brokers and other advisors and (iv) rights agreements and anti-takeover

such representations and warranties to be true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
result in additional net cost, expense or liability to the Company, Avantor, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates of $15 million or
more);

•  the fundamental representation and warranty of the Company relating to absence of a Company material adverse effect are true and
correct in all respects as of the date of the merger agreement and the closing date as though made on and as of such date, except to
the extent any such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such specified
date);

of the closing date as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent any such representation and warranty expressly

breach and (y) the second business day prior to the outside date (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any

“20%) is publicly proposed or announced or made known to the Board, (ii) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated by either
Avantor or the Company as a result of an outside date termination or a vote down termination or by Avantor as the result of a
Company breach termination and (iii) concurrently with or within twelve months after such termination the Company enters into a

the same takeover proposal referred to in clause (i)).

Avantor will pay to the Company a fee of $300 million if:
 
•  the Company or Avantor terminates the merger agreement because CFIUS notifies Avantor or the Company in writing that CFIUS

•  Avantor terminates the merger agreement (if the Company had the right to terminate pursuant to either of the prior two paragraphs at
such time) because the closing date has not occurred on or before the outside date, provided that Avantor’s material breach of the
merger agreement has not been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the merger to occur on or prior to such date.

The Company and Avantor acknowledged, respectively, in the merger agreement that in no event will the Company termination fee or
the Avantor termination fee be payable by the Company or Avantor, as applicable, on more than one occasion.

The merger agreement provides that in the event that the Company termination fee described above is paid to Avantor or its designee,
such Company termination fee will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Avantor and Merger Sub against the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective current, former or future representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the

their respective current, former or future representatives will have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of the merger
agreement or the Transactions other than for a material breach that is a consequence of an act or failure to act undertaken by the
breaching party with knowledge that such party’s act or failure to act would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in or constitute a
breach of the merger agreement (such material breach, a “willful breach”) as set forth in the paragraph below.

Company’s right to: (i) seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with the terms and limitations set

such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company and its former, current and future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,

respective related parties for any losses, damages, costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to the merger
agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained therein), the Transactions (or
any failure of such Transactions to be consummated), the commitment letters, the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of
such financings to be consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection with the
merger agreement, the commitment letters, the Transactions or otherwise; provided that in no event will Avantor have any monetary
liability or obligations pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) in the aggregate in excess of the amount of the Avantor termination
fee and in no event will the Company or any of its related parties seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against any of Avantor, Merger
Sub or their respective related parties (other than Avantor under the confidentiality agreement, to the extent set forth in and in
accordance with the terms thereof) or any lender, preferred equity investor or their respective related parties, or compel payment by any

Avantor and Merger Sub, or compel payment by Avantor and Merger Sub of, any damages or other payments in excess of the amount
of the Avantor termination fee.

While each of the Company and Avantor may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the merger agreement and the payment of the Company termination fee or the Avantor termination fee, as applicable, under no
circumstances will the Company or Avantor be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance that results in the
consummation of the merger and (ii) any money damages (including the Company termination fee or the Avantor termination fee, as
applicable).

Specific Performance
The merger agreement provides that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or any other appropriate form of equitable
relief to prevent breaches of the merger agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions thereof, and
provides for the parties’ waiver of any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or proof of damages in connection with any
such remedy. The merger agreement provides that none of Avantor, Merger Sub or the Company may assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable law or inequitable for any reason, or assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy.

The merger agreement further provides that the Company has the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Avantor and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the closing of the merger, if and only if: (i) the
marketing period has ended and Avantor is required to complete the closing of the merger and Avantor fails to complete the such closing
by the date the closing is required to occur under the merger agreement, (ii) the financing (or, alternative financing, as the case may be)
has been funded or will be funded in accordance with the terms of the commitment letters by the closing date of the merger and (iii) the

merger will occur in accordance with the merger agreement.

Governing Law
The merger agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger
 

The following summarizes the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that are generally applicable to stockholders of
VWR. The following discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations
promulgated under the Code, and existing administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Any change could affect the validity of the following discussion. There can be no
assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not challenge one or more of the tax considerations described herein.

This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their
particular circumstances nor does it address any aspects of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the alternative minimum tax or any
aspects of the tax on “net investment income” imposed under Section 1411 of the Code. This discussion also does not address any
special tax rules applicable to particular stockholders such as stockholders that are financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, S
corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(or an investor in such entities or arrangements), insurance companies, dealers in securities or traders in securities that elect to use a
mark-to-market method of accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, stockholders who acquired their
shares of VWR common stock pursuant to the exercise of compensatory stock options or otherwise in connection with the performance
of services, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates, certain former
citizens or long-term residents of the United States, any person who receives consideration other than cash in the merger (or any
transaction related thereto) and stockholders who hold their shares of VWR common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk
reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of VWR common stock
as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not address the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who demand appraisal rights under Delaware law. In addition, the following discussion
does not address non-income tax consequences or the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or
concurrently with, the merger (whether or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the merger).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of VWR common stock that is (i) an individual who
is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise treated as
such for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all of the substantial decisions
of which one or more United States persons, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to control, or (b) that has
a valid election in effect under the applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person under the Code. A “Non-U.S.
Holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of VWR common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership or other entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If a partner of a partnership or owner of another type of pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the owner of shares
of VWR common stock, the tax treatment of the partner or owner will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of
the partnership or other entity. Accordingly, partnerships and other pass-through entities that hold shares of VWR common stock and
partners or owners of such partnerships or other entities, as applicable, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax
consequences of the merger.

THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW AS OF THE DATE HEREOF. HOLDERS OF SHARES OF VWR
COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN INCOME
AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (continued)
 
 

U.S. Holders
In General
The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the surrendered shares of VWR common stock. A U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of VWR common stock is generally the amount paid for such shares of VWR common stock
(less the amount of any distribution received by such holder treated as a tax-free return of capital). If a U.S. Holder acquired different
blocks of shares of VWR common stock at different times or at different price, such U.S. Holder must determine gain or loss separately
for each block of shares of VWR common stock exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or
loss, and any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares of VWR common
stock is greater than one year as of the closing. A reduced rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a
non-corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Backup Withholding
Cash consideration received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger may be subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding
generally will apply only if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) or otherwise fails to comply with
applicable backup withholding rules and certification requirements. Corporations are generally exempt from backup withholding. Each
U.S. Holder should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 (or substitute or successor form) included with the letter of transmittal and
certify under penalties of perjury that such number is correct and that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding. If a U.S.
Holder fails to provide the correct TIN or certification, payments received may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a 28%
rate. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts so withheld can be credited against such holder’s federal income tax liability
and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Non-U.S. Holders
In General
A Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized upon such Non-U.S. Holder’s
sale of shares of VWR common stock pursuant to the merger agreement unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present
in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable year of such disposition and certain other conditions are met, (ii) the gain is
effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder and, if an applicable income tax treaty so
provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or
(iii) such Non-U.S. Holder’s shares of VWR common stock constitute a “U.S. real property interest” under the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, which will generally be the case if, at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding
the merger or the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for its shares of VWR common stock, VWR was a “United States real property
holding corporation” and such holder held (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the shares of VWR common stock.

If a holder is a Non-U.S. Holder who is an individual and has been present in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable
year of the merger and certain other conditions are satisfied, such holder will be subject to a 30% tax (or a lower rate under an
applicable tax treaty) on the gain recognized in the merger (which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses).

If a holder is a Non-U.S. Holder and any gain recognized in the merger is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and, in the
case of certain tax treaties, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base within the United States), then the Non-U.S.
Holder generally will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. Holder. If the Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may be subject to
an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the
U.S. and such Non-U.S. Holder’s country of residence.

The Company believes that it is not, and will not be as of the effective date of the merger, a “U.S. real property holding
corporation.” However, there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge that determination. In the event that the IRS were to
successfully assert that the Company is a U.S. real property holding corporation, then any gain recognized on the sale of VWR’s

stock by a Non-U.S. Holder who or that held (actually or constructively pursuant to applicable stock ownership attribution rules) more
than 5% of VWR’s common stock at any time during the 5-year period ending on the effective date of the merger would be treated as
effective connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and would therefore by subject to U.S. federal
income tax at the graduated rates applicable to an individual or a corporation (depending on the Non-U.S. Holder’s status). Non-U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to these rules.

Backup Withholding
A Non-U.S. Holder is generally not subject to backup withholding as described above under “— U.S. Holders—Backup Withholding,”
provided such Non-U.S. Holder properly certifies its non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8 BEN-E, or another appropriate
version of IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts so withheld
can be credited against such Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such Non-U.S. Holder to a
refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX
CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, A STOCKHOLDER’S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
OR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF STOCKHOLDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY
NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, EACH
STOCKHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH SUCH STOCKHOLDER’S OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE
PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SUCH STOCKHOLDER.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

Regulatory Matters
 

Antitrust Approval in the U.S.
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated under that Act by the FTC, the transaction may not be completed until notifications have
been given to the United States Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and the FTC and until the specified waiting period has
been terminated or has expired. The initial waiting period is 30 days, but this period may be shortened if the reviewing agency grants
“early termination” of the waiting period, or it may be lengthened if the parties “pull and refile” the notifications and/or the reviewing
agency determines that further investigation is required and issues a formal request, or “second request,” for additional information and
documentary material. Complete Premerger Notification and Report Forms from all required parties, including the Company and New
Mountain Partners III Cayman (AIV-B), L.P., were received by the Premerger Notification Office of the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on or before June 5, 2017. The applicable waiting period is scheduled to expire on
July 5, 2017 at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, unless otherwise terminated or extended.

Antitrust Approval in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions
The merger is also conditioned on (1) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) or
receipt of any necessary approval or clearance required under applicable foreign antitrust law and (2) the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) or receipt of any necessary approval or clearance required under applicable
foreign antitrust law. Foreign antitrust authorities in applicable jurisdictions may take action under the antitrust laws of their jurisdictions
including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion of the merger subject to regulatory
conditions. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger under foreign antitrust laws will not be made or, if such a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful. The Company submitted a notification under the Canadian Competition Act on June
7, 2017.

CFIUS Approval (if applicable)
Section 721 of the Defense Production Act, as well as related Executive Orders and regulations, authorizes the President or CFIUS to
review transactions which could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person. Under the Defense Production Act and
Executive Order 11858, as amended by Executive Order 13456, CFIUS reviews certain covered transactions that are voluntarily
submitted to CFIUS or that are unilaterally reviewed by CFIUS. In general, CFIUS review of a covered transaction occurs in an
initial 30-day review period that may be extended by CFIUS for an additional 45-day investigation period. In unusual circumstances, the
parties may withdraw the notification with CFIUS’s approval without prejudice, and refile it in order to gain more time. In certain
circumstances, the 30-day review and (potentially) 45-day investigation period may be repeated. At the close of its review or
investigation, CFIUS may decline to take any action relative to the covered transaction, may impose mitigation terms to resolve any
national security concerns with the covered transaction, may send a report to the President recommending that the transaction be
suspended or prohibited, or provide notice to the President that CFIUS cannot agree on a recommendation relative to the covered
transaction. The President has 15 days under the Defense Production Act to act on CFIUS’s report.

Under the merger agreement, the parties have agreed to submit a joint voluntary notice to CFIUS if (1) a filing is formally or informally
requested by CFIUS, (2) within 70 days of the date of the merger agreement, Avantor or the Company determines a CFIUS filing is
advisable related to the Transactions or (3) an investigation by CFIUS is commenced for any other reason. If a CFIUS filing is made, the
merger is subject to the condition that the CFIUS approval will have been obtained. In such case, the merger would be conditioned on
the issuance by CFIUS of a written notification that it has concluded a review of the notification voluntarily provided pursuant to the
Defense Production Act, and determined not to conduct a full investigation of the Transactions or, if a 45-day investigation is deemed to
be required, notification that CFIUS has concluded action with respect to the Transactions, thereby clearing the Transactions.

FIRB Approval
The merger is also conditioned on (i) the issuance of a no objection notification by the Treasurer of the Government of Australia after
review of the merger by the FIRB or (ii) the preclusion of a no objection notification by passage of time from making any order or
decision under Division 2 of Part 3 of FATA. Under FATA, certain acquisitions by a foreign person of securities, assets or

Australian land, and actions taken in relation to entities (being corporations and unit trusts) and businesses that have a connection to
Australia may require advance notification to the Treasurer. The FIRB examines proposals by foreign persons to invest in Australia and
makes recommendations to the Treasurer on whether those proposals are suitable for approval under the government’s foreign
investment policy. On June 1, 2017, a notification to the FIRB in Australia was submitted.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

Appraisal Rights
 

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, any holder of record of shares of VWR common stock who has not voted in favor of the merger, who
continuously holds such shares of VWR common stock through the effective date of the merger, who complies with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL and who does not wish to accept the merger consideration may elect to exercise appraisal rights in lieu of
receiving the merger consideration. If the merger is completed, a stockholder who properly demanded appraisal of his, her or its shares
of VWR common stock prior to the vote being taken on the adoption of the merger agreement and who did not vote in favor of adoption
of the merger agreement and who otherwise complies with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL may petition the Delaware Court
of Chancery to determine the “fair value” of his, her or its shares of VWR common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, and receive payment of such fair value of the shares of VWR common stock in cash,
together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, subject to Section 262 of the DGCL. The “fair value” of your
shares of VWR common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the $33.25
per share of VWR common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. Stockholders that
are entitled and wish to exercise appraisal rights must strictly comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

The following discussion is a summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL. The full text of Section 262 of the DGCL
is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL to a “stockholder” and in this summary to a
“stockholder” are to the record holder of the shares of VWR common stock.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger is submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, as in the case of the merger
agreement, the Company, not less than 20 days prior to such meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights
that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes such
notice, and the applicable statutory provisions are attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. This summary of appraisal rights is not
a complete summary of all applicable requirements or the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its
entirety by the text of Section 262 of the DGCL attached as Annex D. Any stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who
wishes to preserve the right to do so should review the following discussion and Annex D carefully and in its entirety. Failure to strictly
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal
rights. Stockholders that validly withdraw, fail to perfect or otherwise lose their appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration, without interest, provided by the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal of shares of VWR common stock, the Company believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising such
rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

A VWR stockholder wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of VWR common stock must do ALL of the
following:
 
•  The stockholder must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special

meeting.
•  The stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Because a properly executed and dated proxy

that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must abstain from voting or instruct that such
stockholder’s shares of VWR common stock be voted against such proposal.

•  The stockholder must continuously hold the shares of VWR common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective
time. The stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares of VWR common stock before the effective time.

•  The stockholder must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of his, her or its
shares of VWR common stock within 120 days after the effective time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file such
petition and has no intention of doing so.

Neither voting, in person or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on nor failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement will constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal
must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote.

Table of Contents

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Appraisal Rights (continued)
 
 
Only a holder of record of shares of VWR common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time may demand
appraisal rights for the shares of VWR common stock registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or
on behalf of the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as the stockholder’s name appears on the stock certificates. The demand must
reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of his,
her or its shares of VWR common stock.

If the shares of VWR common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution
of the demand should be made in that capacity, and if the shares of VWR common stock are owned of record by more than one person,
as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for such
owner or owners. A record holder, such as a broker who holds shares of VWR common stock as nominee for several beneficial owners,
may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of VWR common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares of VWR common stock held for
other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of shares of VWR common stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of shares of VWR common
stock is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of VWR common stock which are held in the name of the
record owner.

IF A STOCKHOLDER HOLDS SHARES OF VWR COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BROKER WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES
OF VWR COMMON STOCK THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE SUCH AS CEDE & CO., A DEMAND
FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES OF VWR COMMON STOCK MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY
NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS RECORD HOLDER. STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR
SHARES OF VWR COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO
EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKERS OR NOMINEES TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF
VWR COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF VWR COMMON STOCK HELD OF
RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER OR NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE
RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.

A stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL should mail or deliver a written demand to:

VWR Corporation
Radnor Corporate Center
Building One, Suite 200
100 Matsonford Road

Radnor, PA 19087
(610) 386-1700

Attn: Corporate Secretary

If the merger is completed, the Company will give written notice of the effective time within ten days after such effective time to each
former VWR stockholder who did not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and who properly made a written demand for
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Within 120 days after the effective time, but not later, either the surviving
corporation or any stockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal of his, her or its shares of VWR common stock
and otherwise complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in
the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of VWR common stock held by all such
dissenting stockholders. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of VWR common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. The surviving corporation is
under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so. Stockholders who desire to have their shares of VWR common
stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the
manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Within 120 days after the effective time, any stockholder who has complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL to that point
in time will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares of VWR common stock not voted in favor of the merger agreement and with respect to which the

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 
Appraisal Rights (continued)
 
 
Company has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares of VWR common stock. The
statement must be mailed within 10 days after such written request has been received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days
after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A person who is the beneficial owner of such
shares of VWR common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, request
from the corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the
stockholder within the later of ten days of receipt of the request and ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal.

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Court of
Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares of VWR common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of VWR common stock have not been reached
by the surviving corporation. After notice to dissenting stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares of VWR common stock as
required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition, and
to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided by
such section.

The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares of VWR common
stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in the Delaware Court of Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings. If the stockholder fails to comply with the court’s direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceeding as to the stockholder. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such
shares of VWR common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of VWR common
stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of VWR common stock, or (2) the value of the consideration provided
in the merger for such total number of shares of VWR common stock exceeds $1 million.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of VWR common stock held by dissenting
stockholders, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, but together with interest,
if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value. Interest will be calculated as of effective date of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge), unless good cause is shown for the Delaware Court of Chancery to use discretion and calculate the interest rate otherwise.
At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal
an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of VWR common stock as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating
that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value
of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL
provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger[.]” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the
nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.” Remedy, in cases of unfair dealing, may or may not be a dissenter’s exclusive remedy. The Delaware Court of Chancery
may determine the fair value to be more than, less than or equal to the consideration that the dissenting stockholder would otherwise
receive under the merger agreement. If no party files a petition for appraisal in a timely manner, then all stockholders will lose the right to
an appraisal, and will instead be entitled to receive the merger consideration provided by the merger agreement, without interest.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and will allocate those costs to the parties as the
Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of
VWR common stock entitled to appraisal.

The fair value of the shares of VWR common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as,
or less than the merger consideration. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the
DGCL.

Any stockholder who has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL may not, after the effective time,
vote the shares of VWR common stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those
shares of VWR common stock, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of VWR common stock as
of a record date prior to the effective time.

If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, or if a stockholder who has not commenced or
joined an appraisal proceeding delivers a written withdrawal of the stockholder’s demand for appraisal within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger, then the right of the stockholder to appraisal will cease. Any attempt to withdraw an appraisal demand made more
than 60 days after the effective time will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned on such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however,
that the foregoing provisions of this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger
consideration within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. If the stockholder fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses the
appraisal right, the stockholder’s shares of VWR common stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration,
without interest.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS MAY
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IN THAT EVENT, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR DISSENTING SHARES OF VWR COMMON STOCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, IF YOU ARE A VWR
STOCKHOLDER AND ARE CONSIDERING EXERCISING YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER THE DGCL, YOU SHOULD
CONSULT YOUR OWN LEGAL ADVISOR.

2017 SPECIAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT   
 

Future Stockholder Proposals
 

If the merger is completed, VWR will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of
stockholders of VWR. However, if the merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in

submitted in writing to the Company’s principal executive offices no later than December 1, 2017.

In addition, the Company’s amended and restated bylaws include advance notice provisions relating to stockholder nominations for
directors or other business not submitted for inclusion in the Company’s proxy statement. The advance notice provisions provide that,
among other things, stockholders provide the Company with timely written notice regarding such nominations or other business and
otherwise satisfy the requirements set forth in the Company’s amended and restated bylaws. To be timely, a stockholder who intends to
present nominations for directors or a proposal at next year’s annual meeting other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 must provide written
notice of the nominations or the other business they wish to propose to the Company at the Company’s principal executive offices, and
must be received no earlier than January 2, 2018, and no later than February 1, 2018. For such proposals that are not timely filed, the
Board retains discretion whether to present such proposals at the 2018 annual meeting, and the Company retains discretion to vote
proxies it receives in connection therewith.

Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a
director if elected. Such notice must also comply with all other requirements of the Company’s amended and restated bylaws.

You may contact the Company’s Corporate Secretary at its principal executive offices for a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions
regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating director candidates.

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation, and, pursuant to the

Agreement (collectively, the “Transactions”) are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) duly authorized
and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of
the Transactions, (iii) declared this Agreement and the Transactions advisable and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company’s
stockholders adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have duly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, and
the board of directors of Merger Sub has declared this Agreement advisable;

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Varietal Distribution Holdings, LLC (“VDH”) has entered into
a voting and support agreement, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially the form set forth in Annex I, pursuant to which, among
other things, VDH has agreed to vote its shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement
as set forth therein (the “Voting Agreement”).

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
The Merger

SECTION 1.01 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger, whereby
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”).

SECTION 1.02 Merger Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Merger Closing”) shall take place at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP,
601 Lexington Ave., New York, New York 10022 on the second business day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VI, other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Merger Closing); provided that, notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties hereto, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to effect the Merger Closing until the earlier of (i) a business day during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent on no less than two business days’ prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the second business day
following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction of conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
at the Merger Closing)). The date on which the Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.”

SECTION 1.03 Effective Time. Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date the Company shall file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the
“Certificate of Merger”) executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with such Secretary of State or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective being the “Effective Time”).

SECTION 1.04 Effects of Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.

(a) Subject to Section 5.04, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to be in the form attached as Exhibit A and, as so amended and restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law.

Table of Contents

(b) Subject to Section 5.04, the By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law, except that references to
the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.06 Directors and Officers.

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.07 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company
(other than any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Company Subsidiary, which shall remain outstanding), Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of other Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 1.07(b) and 1.07(d), each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.08, without interest.

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (“Appraisal Shares”) of Company Common
Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(“Section 262”) shall not be converted into the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.07(c), but instead the holders of Appraisal
Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; provided that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
as provided in Section 1.07(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock and Parent shall have the right to participate (as defined for this purpose in Section 5.09) in,
and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to, such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, approve any
withdrawal of any such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with the
provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of
the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

SECTION 1.08 Payment of Merger Consideration.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration to former holders of Company Common Stock.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, substantially simultaneously with the Effective
Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.07(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”).

(b) Payment Procedure. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common

Table of Contents

Stock (the “Certificates”) that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07 (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are customary and reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate are converted pursuant to Section 1.07 and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.08, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.07. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) Treatment of Book-Entry Shares. No holder of record of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such
holder of record shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time to each such holder of record as of the Effective Time), an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled hereunder and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article I as a result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement. After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

(f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed as of the 12 month anniversary of the
Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or its designated affiliate, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock
entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent or its
successor-in-interest for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Law).

(g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date become the property of the
Surviving Corporation or its designated affiliate, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns
or personal representative previously entitled thereto, subject to the claims of any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to
payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article I.

(h) Investment of Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest. Nothing contained in this Section 1.08(h) and no investment losses resulting from the
investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of the stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration. To the extent there
are losses or the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 1.07(c), Parent shall replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger
Consideration. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent or its
designated affiliate.

SECTION 1.09 Equity Awards.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the “Company
Stock Option Cash Consideration”). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Stock Option Cash
Consideration at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the first payroll date after the Effective Time
unless the first payroll date after the Effective Time is less than three business days after the Effective Time, in which case, the second
payroll date after the Effective Time). Following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company Stock Option shall have the right to
acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company
Stock Option with an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled without the payment of consideration.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under the Company Stock Plan with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Company RSUs”) shall be
converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay such amount at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the first payroll date after
the Effective Time unless the first payroll date after the Effective Time is less than three business days after the Effective Time, in which
case, the second payroll date after the Effective Time).

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plan that is subject to specified vesting criteria
(each, a share of “Restricted Stock”) which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time become
fully vested and be treated in accordance with Section 1.07. At the Effective Time, any outstanding dividends associated with any share
of Restricted Stock shall be paid out by the Company in a cash lump sum to the holder thereof.

(d) The Company shall not commence any purchase period under the Company ESPP after the date hereof, the Company shall not
permit any participant to commence participation in the Company ESPP or to increase the amount of the purchase election under the
Company ESPP with respect to the current purchase period and, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the
Company ESPP to terminate. In the event that the current purchase period under the Company ESPP remains in progress as of the
Closing Date, the Closing Date shall constitute the “Exercise Date” (as defined in the Company ESPP) with respect to such purchase
period, and the shares of Company Common Stock acquired thereby shall be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
as provided under Section 1.07.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if duly authorized, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plan)
shall adopt such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting providing for the transactions contemplated by this
Section 1.09.

(f) No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary
to fulfill the obligations under this Section 1.09.

SECTION 1.10 Tax Receivables Agreement. At the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the Surviving
Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply with its obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make all
payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement that become due in connection with the Merger to be made at the Effective Time.

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent the
concept is recognized by such jurisdiction), except where any such failure would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company Subsidiaries (a) has full power and authority necessary to
enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties, rights and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and (b) is
duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of its properties

(A) the amounts, percentages and basis points of compensation set forth therein and (B) the pricing and other economic terms of the
“market flex” provisions set forth therein) (with respect to such redactions described in subclauses (A) and (B) in this clause (i), none of
which would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, termination or availability of such financing) (collectively, the “Debt
Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of paying the Required Amount on the Closing Date (such committed debt financing
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, together with, unless the context otherwise requires, any debt securities issued in lieu thereof,
the “Debt Financing”), (ii) an executed preferred equity commitment letter from the initial purchaser party thereto (together with any

(b) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect and no amendment or modification is contemplated (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, amendments to each of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add purchasers,
equity investors, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, as applicable, as parties thereto who had not
executed the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, as of the date hereof), and each of the
Commitment Letters, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may
be affected by the Bankruptcy, Equity and Indemnity Exception. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are the only agreements
relating to the Financing and there are no other Contracts, agreements, “side letters” or other arrangements to which Parent or any of its
affiliates is a party relating to the Commitment Letters or the Financing.

the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Commitment Letters, or would (i) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements
set forth in the Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in the Commitment Letters not
being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Financing not being available on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no Lender party to

termination or repudiation (or intent to terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under such Preferred Equity Commitment Letter
or intent not to provide the Preferred Equity Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the Company’s obligations contained in Section 5.15(a)
and the conditions in Section 6.01 and 6.02, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will fail to satisfy any of the
conditions in the Commitment Letters on a timely basis nor does Parent have knowledge that any of the other parties to the Commitment
Letters will not perform their respective obligations thereunder.

(d) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing (after netting out applicable closing payments,
fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex
(including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter) constitute all of the financing required for the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, and are sufficient in amount for Parent to refinance Parent’s, Merger Sub’s and
certain of their affiliates’ existing indebtedness for borrowed money and to satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement, including
paying the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
(including any amounts payable in respect of Company Stock Options and the Tax Receivables Agreement) and all associated fees,
costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions it is required to pay, including the Financing (collectively,
the “Required Amount”). The only conditions precedent related to the obligations of the Preferred Equity Investor to fund the full
amount of the Preferred Equity Financing and the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are expressly set forth in the
Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively.

Commitment Letters or otherwise.

(i) awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection
with the Transactions or (ii) expressly prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing
or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions.

SECTION 3.11 Solvency. Neither of Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger (including the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a)), (b)
the Required Information fairly presents the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of the
periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
and (c) any financial forecasts of the Company made available to Parent as of the date hereof have been prepared in good faith upon
assumptions that were reasonable at such time (it being understood that the Company is not making any representation and warranty
with respect thereto, including as a result of such assumption in this clause (c)), and after giving effect to the Transactions and the
payment of the Merger Consideration and the Required Amount, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term “Solvent,” when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the fair value of
the assets of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of
the property of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liability of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities, direct, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such
businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date and (d) such Person and its subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured.

SECTION 3.12 Independent Investigation. Parent and Merger Sub have conducted their own independent investigation, review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, which investigation, review and analysis was done by Parent and its affiliates and Representatives. In entering
into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have not relied upon any statements, representations or opinions of
the Company or its Representatives, except the representations and warranties of the Company made in Article II or in the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(c). Except for the representations and warranties of the Company made in Article II or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(c), Parent acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries and affiliates or any other Person makes, nor is Parent or

failure to take any such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation,

venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement providing for any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 4.03(a) or Section 4.03(c)), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any such action. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to,
but not after, the Company Requisite Vote has been obtained (x) the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take or
fail to take any of the actions specified in clauses (A), (C), (D) or (E) of the definition of Adverse Recommendation Change (an
“Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change”) if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(f) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (provided that
concurrently with such termination the Company pays any Company Termination Fee to be made pursuant to Section 5.05(b)); provided
that, prior to so making an Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change or so terminating this Agreement, (1) the Company
shall have materially complied with this Section 4.03, (2) the Company Board shall have given Parent at least four business days’ prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for taking such action (which notice, in respect of a

Proposal and all of the material terms and

conditions of such Superior Company Proposal and attach the most current version of the relevant transaction agreement and other
material definitive documents (including financing commitments)), (3) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate in good faith, with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would eliminate the need for taking such action (and in respect of a
Superior Company Proposal, would cause such Superior Company Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal), (4)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement offered in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to
effect such Company Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement to accept such Superior
Company Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, with respect to a
Superior Company Proposal, that such Superior Company Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal and (5) in the
event of any material change to any of the terms or conditions of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (2) of this proviso and a renewed notice period under
clause (2) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four-business-day notice period referred to in clause (2) of this proviso shall
instead be equal to two business days) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section
4.03(d) anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) of this proviso.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 4.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders), including making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company, or
(ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided
that this Section 4.03(e) shall not be deemed to affect whether any such action (other than a recommendation against a Company
Takeover Proposal or a “stop-look-and-listen” communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) would otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(f) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4.03(c) and Section 4.03(d), from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within one business day after receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in
writing of the receipt of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company
reasonably believes would lead to or contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (including any subsequent amendments or modifications thereto and whether made in
writing or orally communicated) and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making any such Company Takeover Proposal or
request, inquiry, proposal or offer. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company and its
Representatives shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail on a reasonably prompt basis as to the status and details of any such
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and any subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) and any material
developments or modifications to the terms thereof.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4.03, the Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) any violation
of the restrictions or obligations set forth in this Section 4.03 by any Company Subsidiary or their or the Company’s Representatives at
the Company’s or the Company Subsidiaries’ direction shall constitute a breach of this Section 4.03 by the Company and (ii) it shall not
nor shall it permit the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement that prohibits or restricts the Company from providing to Parent
the information contemplated by this Section 4.03 or complying with Section 4.03(d).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a customary confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are
no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such
confidentially agreement shall not include an obligation of the Company to reimburse such Person’s expenses.

“Company Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and its subsidiaries)
relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of (A) more than
20% (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Company Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the
Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) more than 20% of the aggregate voting
power of the capital stock of the Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company that, if consummated,
would result in any Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the
aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the Transactions.

Additional Agreements

SECTION 5.01 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Except if prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parent’s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours (under
the supervision of appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms to all their respective properties, books and records, Contracts and personnel (subject to the
chief executive officer’s or general counsel’s consent as set forth in this Section 5.01) and, during such period, the Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish, reasonably promptly, to Parent all information in its possession concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided that any such access shall be afforded and any such
information shall be furnished at Parent’s expense; provided, further, that any such access shall not include any environmental sampling
or testing or any invasive or subsurface investigation. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to afford access or furnish information to the extent (a) such information is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (b) such information relates to the applicable portions of the minutes of the

would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, violate applicable Law or result in
significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable (provided that the Company shall cooperate
with Parent in seeking, and use reasonable best efforts to secure any consent or waiver or other arrangement to allow

Merger Sub and their Representatives may only contact and communicate with the personnel, customers, service providers, regulators,
vendors and suppliers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries related to the Transactions after prior consultation with and the

or conditioned; provided that the foregoing shall not prevent or prohibit Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives from contacting or
communicating with their own personnel, customers, service providers, regulators, vendors and suppliers on matters unrelated to the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Transactions. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall be subject to the

things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers and consents from, the

Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking
to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall use reasonable best
efforts to (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement and (B) if any Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this
Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other, (i) file with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the “FTC”) and the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) the Notification and Report Form, if any, required

(C) a CFIUS Investigation is commenced for any other reason, then, in each case, the parties hereto shall as soon as practicable submit
to CFIUS a draft of a joint voluntary notice of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the “CFIUS Notice”). Each of Parent and
the Company shall (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, the FATA, the Exon-Florio
Amendment, the NISPOM, the ITAR or any Foreign Antitrust Law, (ii) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such filings or
submissions and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of any substantive communication with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ, DDTC, CFIUS, DSS, and any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, and permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure
the participation of, the other party in connection with, any such filings, submissions, substantive communications, substantive inquiries
or requests, provided that such materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company or other
competitively sensitive information; (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law; and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable confidentiality concerns, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, and to
the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not participate in or attend any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any
Governmental Entity in respect of the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the other party, (B) give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable

Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Entity and (E) furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entity’s staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions, provided that that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company;
(y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law; and (z) as necessary to address reasonable confidentiality
concerns, and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, CFIUS, DSS, DDTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent agrees not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under the Antitrust Laws or
enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, except
with the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld (provided such extension does not go
beyond the Outside Date).

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to
avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under any Antitrust
Laws or the FATA that may be required by any Governmental Entity, CFIUS Approval and DSS Approval, so as to enable the parties to
close the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate, divestiture or other
disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing,
modifying or waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or Company or their
respective subsidiaries, (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or the
Company or their respective subsidiaries, and (iv) accepting all such requirements, mitigation measures, or conditions as may be
requested or required by CFIUS, DSS or any other Governmental Entity as necessary or advisable in connection with, or as a condition
of, the receipt of CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval (each a “Remedial Action”); provided that the Company shall not be obligated to
agree to, commit or effect, any Remedial Action unless such Remedial Action is conditioned upon, or will occur subsequent to,
consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions and such
litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take any and all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or resolve any such
litigation, action or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the prior two sentences of this Section 5.02(c), nothing in this
Section 5.02(c) or otherwise shall require or obligate Parent and Merger Sub or any of their affiliates to take any Remedial Action with
respect to Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, including any of the Remedial Actions
described in clauses (i) through (iv) of the first sentence in this Section 5.02(c), if any such Remedial Action individually or in the
aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, assets, liabilities,
businesses or results of operations of Parent, the Company, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any
rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such
acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining (i) any applicable clearance, consent, approval
or waiver under any U.S. Antitrust Law, the FATA or any Foreign Antitrust Law or (ii) CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval with respect to
the Transactions.

(e) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company will submit to DSS and, to the extent applicable,
any other Governmental Entity, notification of the Transactions pursuant to the NISPOM and any other applicable national security or
industrial security regulations, and submit and request approval of measures to mitigate foreign ownership, control or influence (“FOCI”)
arising as a result of the Merger and the other transactions. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to finally and successfully obtain CFIUS Approval and DSS Approval as promptly as practicable.

(f) As soon as possible after the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than twenty (20) business days thereafter, Parent
shall prepare and file with DDTC a notice of the Transactions as required under the ITAR, 22 CFR 122.4(b). Each of Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any inquiries received from DDTC for additional information or
documentation, and to respond promptly to all inquiries and requests from DDTC in connection with such notice.

CFIUS, DSS or DDTC during their respective review process as promptly as practicable, and in all cases within the amount of time

SECTION 5.03 Employee Matters.

(a) From and after the Closing Date and for a period of one year following the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall
provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary (each, a “Company Employee”) (i) salary and incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable in the
aggregate (excluding any value attributable to equity-based compensation) than those provided to such Company Employee by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (excluding defined benefit
pension plan benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation
Period, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide any Company Employee who experiences a termination of
employment under circumstances that would have entitled such Company Employee to severance benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date with severance
benefits at a level at least equal to the severance benefits payable under such Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

(b) Following the Continuation Period, to the extent that any of the existing Company Benefit Plans are discontinued, each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective affiliates (the “Surviving Corporation Plans”) to the extent coverage under any such plan is necessary
to replace coverage under the discontinued Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participates immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.03(a), from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all of the Company’s employment, severance, retention, termination and change in control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change in control severance agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement between
the Company and any Company Employee) maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the
Closing Date, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event) in accordance with their terms.

(d) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any “employee benefit plan,” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
maintained by Parent or any of its respective subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company
Employee’s service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company
or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries; provided that such service need not
be recognized (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (ii) with
respect to any benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan.

(e) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived,
satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit
Plan in which such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide Company Employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, in each case, except to the
extent it would result in any duplication of benefits.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.03 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other
Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.03, and no provision of this
Section 5.03 shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries shall be construed to modify, amend, or establish any benefit plan, program or arrangement or in any way affect the ability
of the parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of its benefit plans, programs or arrangements.

SECTION 5.04 Indemnification.

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights
to advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit
plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an “Indemnified Party”) as
provided in the Company Charter, the Company By-laws, the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreement listed on Section 5.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement (i) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions
and (iv) for a period of six years following the date of this Agreement shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

(b) Without limiting Section 5.04(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement listed on
Section 5.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the
fact that at or prior to the Effective Time the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary
with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors,
whether in any case asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the Company Charter and Company By-laws (or the
corresponding organizational documents of the applicable Company Subsidiary; provided that if such documents provide for a lesser
degree of indemnification than as is provided in the Company Charter and Company By-laws, such Indemnified Party shall be
indemnified and held harmless as and to the fullest extent provided in the Company Charter and Company By-laws as if they instead
applied), each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s
fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by the Company Charter and Company By-laws (or the corresponding
organizational documents of the applicable Company Subsidiary; provided that if such documents require a greater undertaking than the
Company Charter and Company By-laws, what is required by the Company Charter and Company By-laws shall instead apply),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Proceeding). Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with each Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could
seek indemnification hereunder. Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 5.04(b) shall continue in full
force and effect for the period beginning upon the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time; provided that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” directors’
and officers’ liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period
beginning upon the Effective Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are,
individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the “Existing D&O Policies”); provided that the maximum aggregate annual
premium for such “tail” insurance policies shall not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for
coverage for its current fiscal year under the Existing D&O Policies (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in
Section 5.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the “Maximum D&O Tail Premium”). If such “tail” insurance policies have been
obtained by the Company, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such “tail” insurance policies to be maintained in full force
and effect, for their full term, and use reasonable best efforts to cause all its obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving
Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such “tail” insurance policies, then, for the period beginning upon the Effective
Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Existing D&O Policies in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions); provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to
pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of the Maximum D&O Tail Premium; provided further that if the
annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum D&O Tail Premium, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain the most advantageous policies available for an annual premium equal to such amount.

(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers
or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any of its successors or assigns
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable
successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.04.

(e) Prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.04
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.04 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 5.04 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to which each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

SECTION 5.05 Fees and Expenses.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.01, Section 5.04, this Section 5.05, Section 5.07, Section 5.15, Section 5.16(a) and Section 5.16(b),
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent or its designee a fee of $85,000,000 (if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Go-Shop Period
End Date or, if after the Go-Shop Period End Date, in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal from an Excluded Party)) or,
otherwise, $170,000,000 (the “Company Termination Fee”), in each case, if:

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f));

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d); or

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is publicly proposed or announced or made known to the
Company Board, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or
Section 7.01(h) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and (C) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such
termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, a Company Takeover Proposal
(regardless of whether a Company Takeover Proposal relates to the same Company Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (A)).

For purposes of this Section 5.05(b), the term “Company Takeover Proposal” shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of
Company Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.03(h) except that all references to 20% shall be deemed to be references to 50%.
Any fee due under this Section 5.05(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent, (1) in the
case of clause (i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within
two business days after the date of such termination of this Agreement and (3) in the case of clause (iii) above, within two business days
of the consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee
may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times or for the occurrence of different
events, and, in such event, the lowest Company Termination Fee shall be the amount payable.

(c) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under Section 5.05(b)(i) shall constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination
of this Agreement under Section 7.01(f) (but not the amount of the Company Termination Fee). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Company Termination Fee described in this Section 5.05 is paid to Parent or its designee,
such Company Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective current, former or future Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee none of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective current, former or future Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, other than for Willful Breach to the extent set forth in the next sentence.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii), Section 7.01(e) or 7.01(g) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) or Section 7.01(b)(i) if the Company had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(e) or 7.01(g) at such time, then the Company or its designee shall be entitled to receive and Parent shall pay to the
Company, within two (2) business days following the date of such termination, an amount equal to $300,000,000 (the “Parent

remedy of the Company against the Third Party Financing Related Parties for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee none of the Third Party Financing Related Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Any Parent Termination Fee
due under this Section 5.05(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same or at different times or for the occurrence of different events. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Parent
Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(e) While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.10 and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no circumstances shall the Company or
Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance that results in the Merger Closing occurring and (ii) any
money damages (including the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches this Agreement (whether such breach
is intentional and material, unintentional, willful or otherwise or is a Willful Breach) or fails to perform hereunder (whether such failure is
intentional and material, unintentional, willful or otherwise or is a Willful Breach), the Company’s right to: (i) seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief in accordance with the terms and limitations of Section 8.10; or (ii) terminate this Agreement and
(A) receive the Parent Termination Fee if payable pursuant to Section 5.05(d) and (B) if the Parent Termination Fee is not payable
pursuant to Section 5.05(d), seek money damages from Parent in the event of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s Willful Breach, shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies (whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company and the
Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties or the Third Party Financing Related Parties for any losses, damages,
costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of such
transactions to be consummated), the Commitment Letters, the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be
consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or otherwise; provided that in no event shall Parent have any
monetary liability or obligations pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) in the aggregate in excess of the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against any
Parent Related Parties (other than Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent set forth in and in accordance with the
terms thereof) or Third Party Financing Related Parties, or compel payment by any Third Party Financing Related Parties (other than
Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent set forth in and in accordance with the terms thereof) or Parent Related
Parties of, any damages or other payments whatsoever and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek, directly
or indirectly, to recover against Parent and Merger Sub, or compel payment by Parent and Merger Sub of, any damages or other
payments in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee.

(g) The Company agrees, on behalf of itself and its Non-Recourse Parties, and Parent and Merger Sub each agree, on behalf of itself
and their respective Non-Recourse Parties, that all actions, claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether such remedies are
sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any
failure of such transactions to be consummated), the Commitment Letters and the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of
such financings to be consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection with this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or otherwise, in each case, may be made only against the Persons that are expressly identified as
the parties to this Agreement and, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except for claims that
the Company or Parent may bring under, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company hereby waives any and all claims against any and all Third Party Financing
Related Parties arising out of this Agreement, the Merger, the Financing or any other Transaction.

SECTION 5.06 Public Announcements. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by

required by Section 4.03. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in
the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto.

SECTION 5.07 Transfer Taxes. Except as provided in Section 1.08(b) of this Agreement, all stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (“Transfer
Taxes”) incurred in connection with the Transactions and imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns
with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 5.08 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
determines to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the recipient of such withholding at least five (5) business days prior to the date
upon which such payment is to be made to provide such recipient with a reasonable opportunity to provide any form or documentation or
take such other steps as may be required in order to eliminate or minimize any such withholding. Amounts withheld pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

SECTION 5.09 Stockholder Litigation. Until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the Company shall provide
Parent an opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and prosecution of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its
directors relating to any Transaction (the “Transaction Litigation”) and consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and
prosecution of any such stockholder litigation, including the opportunity to review and to propose comments to all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such stockholder litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments proposed by Parent. In no event shall the Company enter into, agree to or disclose any
settlement with respect to such stockholder litigation without Parent’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, except to the extent such settlement is fully covered by the Company’s insurance policies (other than any applicable
deductible), but only if such settlement would not result in the imposition of any material restriction on the business or operations of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or affiliates. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly of the
commencement of any such stockholder litigation of which it has received notice and prior to the Effective Time, each of (x) the
Company and (y) Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the other of all (i) notices and other communications received by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such
party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) civil, criminal
or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings commenced or threatened against the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Board, or any committee thereof, or Parent or any of its subsidiaries, in
each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 5.09 and Section 1.07(d), “participate” means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company shall consider in good faith, but Parent will not be afforded
any decision making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation; provided, that no settlement shall be offered or entered
into or payment made without the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, any litigation relating to Appraisal Shares shall be governed by Section 1.07(d).

SECTION 5.10 Works Councils. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall comply in all material respects with all notification,
consultation and other processes with respect to any works council, economic committee, union or similar body as required by
applicable Law to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which may include any required notifications and
consultation and other processes with respect to any works council, economic committee, union or similar body.

SECTION 5.11 Rule 16b-3 Matters. The Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.12 Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to comply with all of its respective obligations under this Agreement and Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities of any
nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 5.13 Stock Exchange Delisting. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company’s securities to be delisted from Nasdaq
and deregistered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.14 No Control of Other Party’s Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company’s or the Company Subsidiaries’ operations prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and the Company Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

SECTION 5.15 Parent Financing.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using their reasonable best efforts to
(i) promptly negotiate definitive agreements on the terms (including any market flex and securities demand provisions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter) and subject only to the conditions contained in the Commitment Letters so that such agreements are in effect
on the Closing Date, (ii) promptly satisfy (or obtain a waiver to) or cause the satisfaction (or waiver) of all conditions in the Commitment
Letters and the definitive agreements for the Financing (the “Financing Agreements”) applicable to, and within the control of, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their affiliates in such documents, (iii) consummate the Financing on or prior to the date on which the
consummation of the Merger Closing is required to occur, (iv) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters and (v) comply with and
maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters.

(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.15, any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including any market flex and securities
demand provisions) contemplated in the Commitment Letters (unless such portion is not reasonably required to consummate the
Transactions and to pay the Required Amount on the Closing Date), Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, promptly (and in
any event, within one business day) notify the Company thereof, and the reason for the unavailability, and use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, alternative financing in an amount sufficient to pay the Required Amount as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event; provided that, without the prior written consent of the Company, such alternative
financing shall not have any of the effects described in clauses (1) through (5) of Section 5.15(c)(i). Parent shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent with
any portion of the Financing substantially concurrently with the execution thereof. The provisions of this Section 5.15 shall apply to any
alternative financing mutatis mutandis. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to arrange for any such alternative financing does not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of their obligations under this Agreement.

(c) Parent shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements relating to the Financing; provided that: (i) without the prior written consent of the
Company, no such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver shall (1) reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount in respect of the
Financing) to less than the Required Amount (after giving effect to Parent’s available cash on hand), (2) add new conditions precedent
or contingencies to the Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify any existing conditions precedent or contingencies to the
Financing in a manner adverse to Parent (or its affiliates) or that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay or make
less likely to occur the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions or contingencies to the Financing) on the Closing Date,
(3) delay the funding of the Financing or reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of the Financing on the date
upon which the Merger Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02, (4) waive any remedy available to Parent thereunder or
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights under the Commitment Letters or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing, (5) impose obligations on the Company or its affiliates that would be effective prior to the Effective
Time or (6) allow for the early termination of the Commitment Letters; and (ii) it is understood and agreed that Parent may amend the
Commitment Letters to the extent permitted therein to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers, purchasers or similar
entities that have not executed the relevant Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the certificate to be delivered by an authorized officer of the Company under paragraph 10 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter
or paragraph 9 of Exhibit D of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, in each case, with respect to the solvency of the Company may
be delivered by an individual who is an authorized officer of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) To the extent Parent obtains alternative financing pursuant to Section 5.15(b), or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives
any of the Financing pursuant to Section 5.15(c), references to the “Financing,” “Debt Financing,” “Commitment Letter,”

“Debt Commitment Letter,” “Preferred Equity Commitment Letter,” and “Financing Agreement” (and other like terms in this Agreement)
shall be deemed to refer to such alternative financing, the commitments thereunder and the agreements with respect thereto, or the
Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived.

(e) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status of Parent’s
efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company, upon reasonable request, with copies of
agreements relating to the Financing and such other information and documentation regarding such Financing as shall be reasonably
necessary or proper to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within one business day) if at any time prior to the Closing Date: (i) the Commitment
Letters or Financing Agreements expire or are terminated for any reason, (ii) Parent obtains knowledge of any material breach or default
by any party to any Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default), (iii) Parent receives any written notice or other
communication from any Person providing a Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement with respect to any (1) actual, potential or
threatened breach, default, withdrawal, rescission, termination or repudiation (whether in whole or in part) by any party to the
Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreement or (2) a dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment
Letters or any Financing Agreement with respect to the obligation to fund the Financings or the amount of the Financings to be funded
upon the consummation of the Merger Closing or (iv) any other event or development occurs that Parent expects to have a material and
adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain all or any material portion of the Financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters or
any Financing Agreement on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the Financing
Agreements or if Parent, for any reason, otherwise no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms described in the Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event within one business day after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request therefor), Parent shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i) through (iv) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Parent shall furnish the Company drafts (when available) and thereafter true and complete and executed copies of
the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution.

(f) The Company shall (i) provide the financial information related to the Company and its subsidiaries necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in paragraph 5 of Exhibit D to each of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter and
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to use their
reasonable best efforts to provide all customary and reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement, obtaining and
syndication of the Financing and the satisfaction of the conditions of the Commitment Letters to be satisfied as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; including, in each case to the extent reasonable and customary for a financing of the type contemplated by the
applicable Commitment Letters to use reasonable best efforts to:

(i) cooperate in the preparation of any offering memorandum, private placement memorandum, prospectuses or similar
documents, including bank information memoranda (including identifying any portion of the information included therein that
constitutes material, non-public information, and including delivering customary representation letters and authorization letters),
and any other documents required for the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters,

(ii) upon reasonable advance notice to the Company from the Parent, make senior management of the Company reasonably
available for meetings, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and customary lender and “roadshow” presentations and ratings
agency meetings,

advisors in performing their due diligence,

Effective Time;

(v) furnish the Parent and Merger Sub with (x) (A) audited statements of operations, shareholder’s equity and cash flows of VWR
Corporation for the three (3) most recently completed fiscal years and the related audited consolidated balance sheets as of the
end of the two (2) most recently completed fiscal years, in each case ended at least ninety (90) calendar days before the Closing
Date and the related fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year (assuming, for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the Marketing
Period that the Closing Date would occur at the end of such Marketing Period) and (B) unaudited consolidated balance sheets
and related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of VWR Corporation for each subsequent fiscal quarter
(other than the fourth fiscal quarter of the Company’s fiscal year) ended at least 45 calendar days prior to the Closing Date

such Marketing Period); provided, that Parent and

affiliates and Representatives in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or in connection with the cooperation of the Company
as contemplated by this Section 5.15 in each case, except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the material Willful Breach of
this Agreement by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective Representatives. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.15(f)
represent the sole obligation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing. The Company will, upon request of Parent, periodically use reasonable best efforts to update any
Required Information (to the extent it is available) to be included in any offering document to be used in connection with such Financing

Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any financing sources or prospective
financing sources and other financial institutions and investors and purchasers that may become parties to the Financing (and, in each

parties thereto or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company
is an express third-party beneficiary.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the
Merger or any other Transactions is not contingent upon Parent obtaining the Financing or any other third party financing.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement

would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any
other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 8.10(c), without proof of damages or otherwise (and each party

cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,

remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and
without such right none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

occur in accordance with Article I.

jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be heard and determined
exclusively in any Delaware state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of

jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any
party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and irrevocably agrees: (i) that any Proceeding, whether at law
or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Third Party Financing Related Parties arising out of, or relating to this
Agreement, the Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each of the

which shares shall be Common Stock having a par value per share of $0.01.

FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in
this certificate of incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the board of
directors of the Corporation, but any bylaws adopted by the board of directors may be amended or repealed by the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.

SIXTH: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it now exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader rights than permitted prior thereto), no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

(b) Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or
modification with respect to any act, omission or other matter occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.

SEVENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Corporation

another person, or does not present such opportunity to the Corporation; provided, however, that this Article SEVENTH shall not
apply to stockholders who are also officers or employees of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation (other than

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to
the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Stockholder in the negotiation, administration, performance

Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any
such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding,
or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

(c) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any Proceeding, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 5.6.

5.7 Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or Email. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, waivers hereof or consents
or notifications hereunder, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by email with facsimile or scan
attachment, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party, each other party shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or by email
with facsimile or scan attachment as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense.

5.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties and their affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

5.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

5.10 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage may occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In any Proceeding for specific performance, the parties will waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the remedies referred to in this Section 5.10.

5.11 Headings. The Section headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

5.12 Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against
the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

5.13 Interpretation. The definitions of terms herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever
the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The word “shall” shall be
construed to have the same meaning as the word “will.” The words “include,” “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed
by the phrase “without limitation.” The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if.” Unless the context requires otherwise (i) any definition of or reference to any
Contract, instrument or other document or any Law herein shall be construed as referring to such Contract, instrument or other
document or Law as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, (ii) any reference herein to any Person shall be
construed to include such Person’s successors and assigns, (iii) the words “herein,” “hereof” and “hereunder,” and words of similar
import, shall be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision hereof and (iv) all references herein
to Articles and Sections shall be construed to refer to Articles and Sections of this Agreement.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated   

 
 

 
GLOBAL CORPORATE &
INVESTMENT BANKING

 
 
 
 

May 4, 2017

The Board of Directors
VWR Corporation
Radnor Corporate Center
Building One, Suite 200
100 Matsonford Road
Radnor, Pennsylvania 19087

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that VWR Corporation (“VWR”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among
VWR, Avantor, Inc. (“Avantor”) and Vail Acquisition Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avantor (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which,
among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into VWR (the “Merger”) and each outstanding share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of VWR (“VWR Common Stock”) will be converted into the right to receive $33.25 in cash (the “Consideration”).
The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of VWR Common Stock of the
Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.

In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
 
(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to VWR;
 
(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of VWR

furnished to or discussed with us by the management of VWR, including certain financial forecasts relating to VWR prepared by the
management of VWR (such forecasts, “VWR Forecasts”);

 
(iii) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of VWR with members of senior

management of VWR;
 
(iv) reviewed the trading history for VWR Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of other

companies we deemed relevant;
 
(v) compared certain financial and stock market information of VWR with similar information of other companies we deemed relevant;
 
(vi) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions we deemed

relevant;
 
(vii) considered the results of our efforts on behalf of VWR to solicit, at the direction of VWR, indications of interest from third parties

with respect to a possible acquisition of VWR;
 
(viii) reviewed drafts, (a) dated May 4, 2017, of the Agreement, (b) dated May 4, 2017, of the credit facilities commitment letter, by and

among Avantor and the agents and lenders party thereto, (c) dated May 4, 2017, of the preferred equity commitment letter, by and
among Avantor and the Preferred Equity Investor (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and (d) dated May 3, 2017, of the voting
and support agreement, by and between VWR and an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC (“MDP”) (such debt commitment
letter, preferred equity commitment letter, and voting and support agreement, together with the Agreement, the “Transaction
Agreements,” and such drafts, the “Draft Transaction Agreements”); and

 
(ix) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied
upon the assurances of the management of VWR that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or
data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the VWR Forecasts, we have been advised by VWR, and we have
assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments
of the management of VWR as to the future financial performance of VWR. We have not made or been provided with any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of VWR, nor have we made any physical inspection of the
properties or assets of VWR. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of VWR, Avantor or any other entity under any state,
federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at the direction of VWR, that the Merger
will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and
waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on VWR or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We also have
assumed, at the direction of VWR, that the final executed Transaction Agreements will not differ in any material respect from the Draft
Transaction Agreements reviewed by us.

We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the extent
expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transactions or any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion is limited to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be received by holders of VWR Common Stock and no opinion or
view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to
the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the
relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to VWR or in which VWR might
engage or as to the underlying business decision of VWR to proceed with or effect the Merger. We also are not expressing any view or
opinion with respect to, and we have relied, at the direction of VWR, upon the assessments of representatives of VWR regarding, legal,
regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to VWR or the Merger, as to which matters we understand that VWR obtained
such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any

Annex D
Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used
in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and
include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available
for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine
the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were
either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal
rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its
approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation
pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section;
or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title
is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware
corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights
shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections
(d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or
consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares
of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the
corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such
on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with
respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are
available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of

this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the
corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such
action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with
this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has
become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter
shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall,
also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of
the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in
writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such
constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after
such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in
the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is
entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of
the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has
been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than
10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who
has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written
statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by
the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was

Table of Contents

filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if
so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City
of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be
approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who
hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
§ 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court
shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such
fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the
judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between
the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that
time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,
the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of
this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions
on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the
merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of
this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.

Table of Contents

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted
had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting
corporation.
