Chemtura Corporation
1818 Market Street, Suite 3700, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103

199 Benson Road, Middlebury, Connecticut 06749

December 23, 2016

Dear Chemtura Stockholder:

        On September 25, 2016, Chemtura Corporation ("Chemtura") entered into a definitive merger agreement with Lanxess
Deutschland GmbH ("Lanxess") and LANXESS Additives Inc. ("Merger Subsidiary"). Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement,
Merger Subsidiary, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess will be merged with and into Chemtura, with Chemtura surviving the
merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess.

        If the merger is completed, Chemtura stockholders will have the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Chemtura that they own immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger.

        We will hold a special meeting of our stockholders in connection with the proposed merger on February 1, 2017 at the Pyramid Club,
1735 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103 at 8:30 a.m., local time (unless the special meeting is adjourned or postponed). At the special
meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), stockholders will be asked to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement, as it may be amended from time to time. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Chemtura common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

        We cannot complete the merger unless Chemtura stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. Your vote is very
important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you are able to attend the special meeting in person, please
complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it in the envelope provided or vote by telephone (at (800) 690-6903) or
via the internet (at www.proxyvote.com) as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special
meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof).

        After careful consideration, the Chemtura board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Chemtura stockholders
and has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The Chemtura board of directors unanimously recommends that
Chemtura stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

        In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that require us to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with
respect to certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates
to the merger. The Chemtura board of directors unanimously recommends that Chemtura stockholders vote "FOR" the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal described in the accompanying proxy statement.

        The obligations of Chemtura and Lanxess to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. The
accompanying proxy statement contains detailed information about Chemtura, the special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Thank you for your consideration of this matter and your continued confidence in Chemtura.

        NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS
APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE MERGER, PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR DETERMINED IF
THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE
CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

        The accompanying proxy statement is dated December 23, 2016 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy, is first being mailed

THE MERGER 

        A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire merger
agreement carefully because it is the principal document governing the merger. For more information on the merger agreement, see the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 83 of this proxy statement.

Effects of the Merger (see page 32) 

        If the merger is completed, then, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Chemtura.
Chemtura will survive the merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess.

        Upon consummation of the merger, your shares of Chemtura common stock will be converted into the right to receive the per share
merger consideration described below unless you have properly demanded rights of appraisal in accordance with Delaware law. As a
result, you will not own any shares of the surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any interest in its future earnings or growth.

As a result of the merger, Chemtura will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be indirectly wholly owned by Lanxess.
Following consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation will terminate the registration of our common stock on the NYSE and
Euronext Paris and we will no longer be subject to reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act").

Merger Consideration (see page 32) 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Chemtura stockholders will
have the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Chemtura common
stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

Treatment of Chemtura Equity-Based Awards (see page 74) 

        At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, equity-based awards (and long-term cash awards granted to certain
employees in lieu of equity-based awards) held by Chemtura's officers, employees and non-employee directors will be treated as follows:

• Each outstanding stock option, each vested restricted stock unit (including stock awards deferred by directors under the
Chemtura Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan), and each performance share for which the
performance period has ended will be canceled in exchange for payment to the holder of an amount in cash equal to the
merger consideration of $33.50 per share, multiplied by the number of shares of Chemtura common stock underlying the
award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of a stock option, and based on actual performance as of the end of the
performance period, in the case of a performance share); 

• Each vested cash award will be canceled in exchange for payment to the holder of an amount in cash equal to the face
amount of such award; 

• Each unvested restricted stock unit, and each performance share for which the performance period has not ended, will be
converted into a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the merger consideration of $33.50 per share (based on target
performance, in the case of a performance share). Each such deferred award will be paid in cash in accordance with the
vesting and payment schedule applicable to the corresponding restricted stock unit or performance share. The vesting and
payment of the awards would accelerate on termination of the holder's employment without "cause" or resignation for
"good reason" following the merger (except that such payment will be delayed to the extent required to avoid triggering a
tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")); and 

• Each unvested cash award will continue as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will vest and
become payable on termination of the holder's employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason."

        No new offering period will commence under the Chemtura 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan after the end of 2016, and the plan
will be terminated effective as of the closing of the merger. The amount credited to each participant's account on the final purchase date
under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which date will be no later than five business days prior to the closing date of the merger)
will be applied to purchase the number of shares of Chemtura common stock determined pursuant to the terms of the plan. At the effective
time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, each such share of Chemtura common stock will
be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Recommendation of the Chemtura Board of Directors (see page 58) 

        After careful consideration, the Chemtura board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Chemtura board in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement can be found in the section entitled "The
Merger—Chemtura's Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement. The Chemtura board unanimously
recommends that Chemtura stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; 

• "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger; and 

• "FOR" the proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Opinion of Chemtura's Financial Advisor (see page 59) 

        In connection with the merger, at the special meeting of the Chemtura board on September 25, 2016, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
("Morgan Stanley") rendered its oral opinion to the Chemtura board (which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion)
that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the $33.50 per share merger
consideration to be received by the holders of Chemtura common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Chemtura board, dated September 25, 2016, is
attached as Annex B and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. Chemtura's stockholders are urged to, and should, read the opinion
carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to the Chemtura board and addresses only the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Chemtura's stockholders of the $33.50 per share merger consideration to be received by such holders
pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion does not address any other aspect of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to Chemtura's stockholders as to
how to vote at the special meeting held in connection with the merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion set forth in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion.

Financing of the Merger (see page 80) 

        Completion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition. Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Lanxess
AG entered into a bridge loan facility agreement, dated September 25, 2016 (the "Credit Agreement"), with Barclays Bank PLC and J.P.
Morgan Limited, as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners, Barclays Bank PLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as underwriters and
original lenders (together with the other financial institutions that may become party thereto as lenders from time to time, the "Lenders")
and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as administrative agent. Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement"), the Lenders
committed to provide an unsecured term loan bridge credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to €

2.0 billion to Lanxess AG for the purposes of funding (i) the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Chemtura pursuant to the
merger agreement, (ii) the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any payments in respect
of interest rate hedging agreements and currency swaps entered into to hedge any currency exposure related to the merger and (iv) the
payment of all related fees, costs and expenses. In connection with the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of bonds by Lanxess AG in
an aggregate principal amount of €1.0 billion, the commitments under the Credit Agreement were reduced to €1.0 billion on October 10,
2016. In connection with the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of hybrid notes by Lanxess AG in an aggregate principal amount of
€500 million, the commitments under the Credit Agreement were further reduced to €500 million on December 6, 2016. The remaining
commitments under the Credit Agreement automatically terminate on the earliest of (a) the date that the merger is consummated,
(b) December 25, 2017, and (c) the date of termination of the merger agreement prior to the closing of the merger. Lanxess intends to use
the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement along with cash on hand to finance the merger and pay related expenses.

        The obligation of the Lenders to provide debt financing under the Credit Agreement is subject to a number of conditions. There is a
risk that these conditions will not be satisfied and the debt financing may not be funded when required.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 82) 

        The exchange of Chemtura common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and may also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 81) 

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), which prevents Chemtura and Lanxess from completing the merger until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the HSR Act waiting
period is terminated or expires. On October 17, 2016, Chemtura and Lanxess filed the requisite notification and report forms under the
HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC, which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. On November 16, 2016, Lanxess withdrew
its notification and re-filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on November 18,
2016. This triggered the start of a new HSR Act waiting period, which expired on December 19, 2016. The DOJ, the FTC, state attorneys
general and others may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, any of the DOJ, the FTC, state attorneys general or others
could take action under the antitrust laws, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger. We cannot assure
you that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.

        Completion of the merger is also conditioned on approval from the European Commission. The merger cannot be completed until a
notification has been filed with the European Commission and the European Commission has adopted, or has been deemed under E.U.
Merger Regulation ("EUMR") to have adopted, all decisions and approvals necessary to allow consummation of the merger. The first
phase review period under the EUMR is 25 working days from submission of a complete notification. The notification has not yet been
filed with the European Commission.

Table of Contents

        Approval, consent or consultation, as applicable, with respect to the merger in each of Brazil, China, Japan, and South Korea is a
condition to the closing of the merger.

        The merger agreement also provides for Chemtura and Lanxess to file a joint voluntary notice under Section 721 of Title VII of the
Defense Production Act of 1950 (the "DPA"). The DPA provides for national security reviews and, where appropriate, investigations by
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS"), when a foreign company's proposed or actual acquisition of control
of a U.S. company could affect U.S. national security. The merger cannot be consummated unless Chemtura and Lanxess receive approval
by CFIUS, meaning (i) Chemtura and Lanxess have received written notice from CFIUS that any review, investigation or other proceeding
under the DPA with respect to the merger has concluded without action or recommendation for suspension or prohibition; (ii) CFIUS has
concluded that the merger is not a covered transaction subject to review; or (iii) the President of the United States has not, within 15
calendar days of a CFIUS report to him, announced a decision to take any action to block, suspend, otherwise prevent or place any
limitations on the consummation of the merger. There can be no assurance that CFIUS will conclude its review, investigation or other
proceeding without imposing significant conditions, or that CFIUS will not recommend that the President of the United States block the
merger.

        Chemtura is registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State ("DDTC") as a manufacturer
and exporter of "defense articles," as that term is defined under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). ITAR requires that
a registrant notify DDTC at least 60 days prior to the consummation of any transaction that would result in "the sale or transfer to a foreign
person of ownership or control" of a registrant. The merger cannot be completed unless and until (i) 60 days have passed since Chemtura
notified the DDTC of the merger and the DDTC has not taken or threatened to take enforcement action against Lanxess in connection with
the consummation of the Merger or (ii) the DDTC has notified Chemtura or Lanxess that it does not intend to take enforcement action
against Lanxess in connection with the consummation of the merger. Chemtura submitted the notice of the merger to the DDTC on
November 10, 2016.

        For more information about regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see the sections entitled "The Merger—Regulatory
Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger" beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement and "The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement.

        Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory
clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will
not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require
changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

Expected Timing of the Merger (see page 84) 

        We expect to complete the merger by mid-2017. The merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and approvals and other
conditions, however, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Chemtura or Lanxess could result in the merger being completed
at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We
expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 100) 

        As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the merger agreement, each party's obligation to consummate the merger
depends on a number of conditions being satisfied (or, if permitted by applicable law, waived), including:

• Approval and adoption of the merger agreement by an affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of
Chemtura common stock entitled to vote thereon in accordance with Delaware law; 

• No restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court or other governmental
authority of competent jurisdiction in (i) the United States, (ii) any jurisdiction in which Chemtura, Lanxess or their
respective subsidiaries conduct operations (other than de minimis operations) or make sales (other than de minimis sales)
and (iii) any jurisdictions where the merger agreement requires that Chemtura make an antitrust filing, in each case,
preventing the consummation of the merger, will have taken effect and will still be in effect; 

• Any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act, the EUMR and certain other competition
laws relating to the merger will have expired or been terminated and all required approvals under certain other competition
laws will have been obtained; 

• Approval by CFIUS, meaning that (i) Chemtura and Lanxess have received written notice from CFIUS that any review,
investigation or other proceeding under the DPA with respect to the merger has concluded without action or
recommendation for suspension or prohibition; (ii) CFIUS has concluded that the merger is not a covered transaction
subject to review or (iii) the President of the United States has not, within 15 calendar days of a CFIUS report to him,
announced a decision to take any action to block, suspend, otherwise prevent or place any limitations on the consummation
of the merger; 

• Any applicable waiting period under ITAR relating to the merger will have expired or DDTC shall have notified Chemtura
or Lanxess that it does not intend to take enforcement action in connection with the merger; 

• The other party will not have breached, or failed to perform in any material respect, its obligations under the merger
agreement contemplated to be performed by it at or prior to the effective time of the merger; 

• The accuracy of representations and warranties made by the other party in the merger agreement (subject generally to a
material adverse effect standard, with different standards applicable to certain representations and warranties); and 

• As a condition to the obligation of Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary only, between the date of the merger agreement and the
closing date, there will not have occurred any change, effect, event, development, occurrence, circumstance or state of facts
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Chemtura's financial condition, business, assets or liabilities or results of operations of Chemtura and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or Chemtura's ability to consummate the merger.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals (see page 92) 

        Subject to certain exceptions, Chemtura has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will not, and will not authorize any of their respective
directors and officers, employees, affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives to, directly or
indirectly:

• Solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of an acquisition proposal; 

• Enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Chemtura or any of its
subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries to,
or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, any third party that may reasonably be expected to make, or has made,
an acquisition proposal; or 

• Enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar instrument relating to an acquisition proposal.

        Prior to approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Chemtura stockholders, however, Chemtura may, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third
party if such third party has made a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal that the Chemtura board reasonably believes may
lead to a superior proposal and the Chemtura board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the Chemtura directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Changes in Board Recommendation (see page 94) 

        Except as summarized below, the Chemtura board has agreed not to withhold, qualify, change, fail to make (including any failure to
reaffirm within five business days of a request from Lanxess following the making of a public acquisition proposal or any publicly
disclosed change to the material terms thereof), withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Lanxess the Chemtura board's
recommendation in favor of the merger (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal).

        However, the Chemtura board may withhold, qualify, change or fail to make its recommendation with respect to approval and
adoption of the merger agreement:

• Following receipt of a bona fide acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of the obligations described in the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 92 of
this proxy statement that the Chemtura board reasonably believes may lead to a superior proposal; or 

• Following certain intervening events unrelated to an acquisition proposal that were neither known nor reasonably
foreseeable by the Chemtura board prior to the date of the merger agreement;

but in each case only if the Chemtura board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, and subject to compliance with
certain notice and other specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including giving Lanxess the opportunity to make
adjustments to the merger agreement in response to the proposed change in recommendation. In the event that the Chemtura board is
permitted to change its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement following the receipt of an acquisition proposal that it
determines to be a superior proposal, Chemtura may also terminate the merger agreement to enter into a written agreement for such
superior proposal if immediately prior to any such termination, Chemtura pays to Lanxess in immediately available funds the fee required
to be paid to Lanxess as described in the section entitled

"The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Chemtura" beginning on page 103 of this proxy statement.

        In addition, if the Chemtura board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement, Lanxess may terminate the
merger agreement and collect a termination fee as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by
Chemtura" beginning on page 103 of this proxy statement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 101) 

        The merger agreement may be terminated:

• At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, by mutual written consent of Chemtura and Lanxess; 

• At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, by either Chemtura or Lanxess if: 

• The merger has not been consummated on or prior to September 25, 2017 (the "End Date"); provided, that if one or
more closing conditions relating to the absence of injunctions preventing the consummation of the merger or
regulatory approvals are unsatisfied as of the End Date and the remaining mutual closing conditions, other than
those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the closing and such conditions are then capable of
being satisfied, are satisfied, or waived by all parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, then upon written
notice given by either Chemtura or Lanxess, the End Date may be extended to December 22, 2017; provided,
further, that this termination right will not be available to any party whose material breach of any provision of the
merger agreement is the primary cause of the failure of the merger to be consummated by such time; 

• Any permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger has become final and nonappealable; or 

• The meeting of Chemtura stockholders to approve and adopt the merger agreement has been held and the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders has not been obtained upon a vote thereon at such
meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; 

• At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, by Chemtura if: 

• At any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Chemtura stockholders in order to enter
into a binding written agreement for an acquisition proposal that is a superior proposal, if such superior proposal
did not result from a breach by Chemtura of the covenants described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement
—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement, and,
immediately prior to or concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, Chemtura enters into such
binding acquisition proposal and, as a condition to any such termination, immediately prior to the termination of the
merger agreement, Chemtura pays to Lanxess in immediately available funds any fees required to be paid to
Lanxess as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Chemtura"
beginning on page 103 of this proxy statement; or 

• Lanxess or Merger Subsidiary has breached any of its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements such that conditions to closing related to such matters are not capable of being satisfied
prior to or as of the End Date, and such

given by Chemtura to the breaching party and the End Date; or

• At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, by Lanxess if: 

• Prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Chemtura stockholders, an Adverse
Recommendation Change occurs; 

• Chemtura has breached any of its representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements such that conditions to closing related to such matters are not capable of being satisfied prior to or as of
the End Date, and such breach or failure to perform (if curable) has not been cured by the earlier of within 30 days
after written notice is given by Chemtura to the breaching party and the End Date; or 

• Chemtura willfully and materially breaches or fails to perform its obligations described in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 92 of this proxy
statement.

Termination Fee Payable by Chemtura (see page 103) 

        Chemtura has agreed to pay Lanxess a termination fee of $75 million in cash upon termination of the merger agreement in certain
circumstances, including if:

• Lanxess terminates the merger agreement because prior to the special meeting, (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change
occurs or (ii) Chemtura willfully and materially breaches or fails to perform its obligations described in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 92 of this proxy
statement; 

• Chemtura terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a written agreement with respect to a superior acquisition
proposal; or 

• Either party terminates the merger agreement (i) owing to the failure of the merger to be consummated on or before the End
Date, and at such time the special meeting of Chemtura stockholders to approve and adopt the merger agreement has not
been held or (ii) owing to the failure of Chemtura stockholders to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but in each
case only if: 

• An acquisition proposal has been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn at least five business days prior to
such termination (in the case of clause (i) above) or prior to the Chemtura stockholders' meeting to approve and
adopt the merger agreement (in the case of clause (ii) above); and 

• Within 12 months after such termination, Chemtura enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or
consummates any alternative acquisition proposal for more than 50% of the assets or voting securities of Chemtura.

Remedies; Maximum Liability (see page 103) 

        The merger agreement provides that, upon any termination of the merger agreement under circumstances where the termination fee is
payable by Chemtura and is paid in full, Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary are precluded from any other remedy against Chemtura (except in
the case of any willful and material breach of the merger agreement or fraud), and neither Chemtura nor Merger Subsidiary will seek to
obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind against Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives. In no event will Chemtura
be required to pay the termination fee more than once.

Specific Performance (see page 103) 

        The merger agreement provides that the parties will be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to
specifically enforce the performance of the terms and provisions of the merger agreement.

Appraisal Rights (page 83 and Annex C) 

        Under Delaware law, holders of our common stock who do not vote in favor of approving and adopting the merger agreement will
have the right to seek appraisal of and receive the fair value of their shares of our common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery if the merger is completed, but only if they comply with all requirements of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL"), as in effect on September 25, 2016, the date of the parties' entry into the merger agreement, the text of which section
can be found in Annex C to this proxy statement and the requirements of which section are summarized in this proxy statement. If a
stockholder votes (or submits a proxy to vote that is not revoked before the taking of the vote on the merger agreement at the special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof) for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, such stockholder will waive his, her
or its rights to seek appraisal of his, her or its shares of Chemtura common stock under Delaware law. Also, merely voting against or
abstaining (in person or by proxy) with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will not protect a stockholder's rights to an
appraisal. This appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration. Any holder of our common stock
intending to exercise appraisal rights, among other things, must submit a written demand for an appraisal to us prior to the vote on the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement, must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of adoption of the merger agreement
and must hold his, her or its shares of Chemtura common stock of record when submitting a written demand for appraisal and continue to
hold the shares through the effective time of the merger. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Delaware law will
result in the loss of your ability to seek and obtain appraisal rights. Holders of our common stock who wish to seek appraisal of their
shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. Additionally, holders of our common stock that hold shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record and wish to
exercise appraisal rights should consult with the record holder of your shares to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a
demand for appraisal by such record holder.

The Special Meeting (see page 26) 

        The special meeting of Chemtura's stockholders is scheduled to be held at the Pyramid Club, 1735 Market Street, Philadelphia,
PA 19103 on February 1, 2017 at 8:30 a.m., local time. The special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on the following:

• A proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled "The Merger"
and "The Merger Agreement," beginning on pages 32 and 83, respectively, of this proxy statement; 

• A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under the section entitled "The
Merger—Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 74 of this proxy
statement; and 

• A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to
approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        Only holders of record of Chemtura common stock at the close of business on December 23, 2016, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. At the close of
business on the record date, 63,001,260 shares of Chemtura common stock were issued and outstanding. At the close of business on
December 21, 2016, approximately 2.56% of Chemtura's issued and outstanding common stock was held by Chemtura's directors and
executive officers. We currently expect that Chemtura's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive
officer has entered into any agreement containing an obligation to do so.

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Chemtura
common stock entitled to vote outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be
conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be
counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special
meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Chemtura to additional expense.

        You may cast one vote for each share of Chemtura common stock that you own at the close of business on the record date. Approval
and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock
entitled to vote thereon. The proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by
Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided that a
quorum is present). The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at
the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present).

        An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the
special meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Because under Delaware law the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of Chemtura common stock
entitled to vote thereon, abstentions and a complete failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy
card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to
the broker, bank or other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement. Because the other two proposals require the affirmative vote of the majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, abstentions will be counted as votes "AGAINST" such proposals;
however, a failure to vote (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner
of shares held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee) will
have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.

        If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy,
the proxy will be voted for (i) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; (ii) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger; and (iii) the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional
proxies, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 74)

        In considering the recommendation of the Chemtura board to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
Chemtura's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Chemtura
stockholders generally. The Chemtura board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the
merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and in recommending to Chemtura stockholders that the
merger agreement be approved and adopted. These interests are described in further detail and quantified below under "The Merger—
Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 83) 

        In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on or around November 16, 2016, a purported stockholder
of Chemtura filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against
Chemtura, the members of the Chemtura Board, Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary, captioned Scarantino v. Chemtura Corporation, et al., 16
Civ. 6051-ER (the "Action"). The Action asserts a claim against Chemtura and the members of the Chemtura Board pursuant to
Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and a claim against the members of the Chemtura Board, Merger Subsidiary and
Lanxess pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint generally alleges that the preliminary proxy
statement omitted certain material information regarding the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and also alleges that the
merger consideration is unfair, certain terms of the merger agreement are unfair, and the individual defendants are financially interested in
the merger. The Action seeks, among other remedies, to enjoin the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or in the event that
an injunction is not awarded, rescission of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and unspecified money damages, costs
and attorney's fees. Chemtura believes that the Action is without merit and intends to defend vigorously against all claims asserted.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification (see page 97) 

        For six years after the effective time of the merger, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in accordance with the applicable organizational documents of Chemtura
and its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, each present or former director or officer of Chemtura or any of its
subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") against all threatened or pending claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal (each, a "Proceeding") to which the Indemnified Person is
made a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Person is otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out
of or pertaining in whole or in part to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of
Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Chemtura as such for another enterprise (including any
Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring or existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred, at or prior to the effective time of the merger, or arising out of or pertaining to the merger agreement
and the transactions and actions contemplated thereby). In addition, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to advance
expenses (subject to certain conditions) as incurred to the Indemnified Persons and to cooperate in the defense of any Proceeding.

Market Prices of Chemtura Common Stock (see page 104) 

        The merger consideration of $33.50 per share represents an 18.9% premium to the $28.18 closing price per share of Chemtura
common stock on September 23, 2016, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger agreement; a 19.8% premium to the
$27.96 average closing price per

per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market prices of Chemtura common stock in connection with voting your shares of
Chemtura common stock.

Q: What will happen in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Chemtura, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Subsidiary will cease and Chemtura will be the surviving corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess. As a
result of the merger, Chemtura common stock will no longer be publicly traded, and you will no longer have any interest in
Chemtura's future earnings or growth. In addition, Chemtura common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and Euronext Paris
and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Chemtura will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with respect to Chemtura common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules
and regulations. 

Q: Who will own Chemtura after the merger? 

A: Immediately following the merger, Chemtura will be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess. 

Q: What will I receive in the merger? 

A: Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, if the merger is completed, the holders of Chemtura
common stock will have the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of Chemtura common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. 

Q: What will happen in the merger to Chemtura equity-based awards? 

A: At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, equity-based awards (and long-term cash awards granted to certain
employees in lieu of equity-based awards) held by Chemtura's officers, employees and non-employee directors will be treated as
follows: 

• Each outstanding stock option, each vested restricted stock unit (including stock awards deferred by directors under the
Chemtura Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan), and each performance share for which the
performance period has ended will be canceled in exchange for payment to the holder of an amount in cash equal to the
merger consideration of $33.50 per share, multiplied by the number of shares of Chemtura common stock underlying the
award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of a stock option, and based on actual performance as of the end of the
performance period, in the case of a performance share); 

• Each vested cash award will be canceled in exchange for payment to the holder of an amount in cash equal to the face
amount of such award; 

• Each unvested restricted stock unit, and each performance share for which the performance period has not ended, will be
converted into a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the merger consideration of $33.50 per share (based on target
performance, in the case of a performance share). Each such deferred award will be paid in cash in accordance with the
vesting and payment schedule applicable to the corresponding restricted stock unit or

performance share. The vesting and payment of the awards would accelerate on termination of the holder's employment
without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" following the merger (except that such payment will be delayed to the
extent required to avoid triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code); and

• Each unvested cash award will continue as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will vest and
become payable on termination of the holder's employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason."

No new offering period will commence under the Chemtura 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan after the end of 2016, and the
plan will be terminated effective as of the closing of the merger. The amount credited to each participant's account on the final
purchase date under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which date will be no later than five business days prior to the
closing date of the merger) will be applied to purchase the number of shares of Chemtura common stock determined pursuant to
the terms of the plan. At the effective time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement,
each such share of Chemtura common stock will be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest, and less
any applicable withholding taxes.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration? 

A: Yes. As a holder of Chemtura common stock, you are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger
if you meet certain conditions. In order to perfect appraisal rights, you must follow exactly the procedures specified under
Delaware law. See "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 83 of and Annex C to this proxy statement. 

Q: What vote is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement? 

A: Under Delaware law, the approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Chemtura common stock entitled to vote thereon. 

Q: What vote is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura
to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger? 

A: The named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, approval of which is not required to complete the merger,
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided a quorum is present in person or represented by proxy). 

Q: What vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement? 

A: The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, the approval of which is not required to complete the merger, requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present in person or represented by proxy). 

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: In order to complete the merger, Chemtura must obtain the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
described in this proxy statement and the other closing conditions

under the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the
merger by mid-2017, although Chemtura cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to
a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time.

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation
that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger? 

A: SEC rules require Chemtura to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve any agreements or understandings and compensation
that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of this proposal by
Chemtura's stockholders is not required to complete the merger. 

Q: Do you expect the merger to be taxable to Chemtura stockholders? 

A: The exchange of Chemtura common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and may also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement and consult your tax advisers regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences
arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. 

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting? 

A: The record date for the special meeting is December 23, 2016. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on that date are
entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The only class of stock that can be
voted at the meeting is Chemtura common stock. Each outstanding share of Chemtura common stock is entitled to one vote on all
matters that come before the meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 63,001,260 shares of Chemtura
common stock issued and outstanding. At the close of business on December 21, 2016, approximately 2.56% of Chemtura's issued
and outstanding common stock was held by Chemtura's directors and executive officers. We currently expect that Chemtura's
directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although no director or executive officer is obligated to do so. 

Q: Who may attend the special meeting? 

A: Stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 23, 2016, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting.
"Street name" holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee) should bring a copy of an account
statement reflecting their ownership of Chemtura common stock as of the record date. If you are a "street name" holder and you
wish to vote at the special meeting, you must also bring a proxy from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the
shares of Chemtura common stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. We intend to limit attendance to stockholders as
of the record date. All stockholders should bring photo identification. Cameras, recording devices, and other electronic devices are
not permitted at the special meeting. Registration will begin at 8:30 a.m., local time.

Q: Who is soliciting my vote? 

A: The Chemtura board is soliciting your proxy, and Chemtura will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Morrow Sodali ("Morrow") has
been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Morrow will be paid approximately $10,000 and will be reimbursed for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation
initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other
like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of Chemtura common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other
electronic medium by Morrow or, without additional compensation, by certain of Chemtura's directors, officers and employees. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its
annexes. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting in person, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly
as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special meeting. 

Q: How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name? 

A: If you are a stockholder of record, there are three methods by which you may vote at the special meeting: 

• Internet:  To vote over the internet, log on to www.proxyvote.com. If you vote over the internet, you do not have to mail in a
proxy card. 

• Telephone:  To vote by telephone, call (800) 690-6903. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in a proxy card. 

• Mail:  To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage paid envelope provided.
If you return your signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct. 

• In Person:  To vote in person, attend the special meeting. You will be given a ballot when you arrive.

Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy, whether by internet, by telephone or by mail, to
ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote your shares in person, even if you have already voted by
proxy. Attendance at the special meeting, by itself, will not revoke a previous vote by proxy. Please choose only one method to
cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to vote over the internet, which is a convenient, cost-effective and reliable
alternative to returning a proxy card by mail.

Q: How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)? 

A: If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in "street name," you will receive a form
from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your
broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.

Q: Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy? 

A: Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways: 

• You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by telephone or by mail; 

• You may send a written notice prior to the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) that you are
revoking your proxy to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury,
Connecticut 06749. 

• You may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote again in person. Simply
attending the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.

If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker,
bank or other nominee to change or revoke your proxy.

If you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact the Corporate Secretary, by telephone at
(203) 573-2000 or by mail to Office of the Corporate Secretary, Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury,
Connecticut 06749.

Q: How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting? 

A: The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Chemtura common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted
at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement
and will subject Chemtura to additional expense. 

Q: What if I abstain from voting? 

A: If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still
be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting on any proposal at the special
meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" such proposals. 

Q: Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone or in person? 

A: If you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone or in
person, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists. Questions concerning registered stockholders may be directed to our transfer agent, Computershare Inc., by telephone at
(866) 233-4822 or by mail to P.O. Box 30170, College Station, TX 77842.

If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or
other nominee may vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters.
Under NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in
"street name" and you do not issue instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted at the special
meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

If you fail to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card by mail, or vote via the internet, by telephone or in person, it will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the
other proposals.

You will have the right to receive the merger consideration if the merger is approved, adopted and completed even if your shares
are not voted at the special meeting.

Q: What is a broker non-vote? 

A: Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares
how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers
and other record holders do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this
proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Chemtura common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions
to the broker or other holder of record, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals
described in this proxy statement.

If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted and the effect will be
the same as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. However, a failure to instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee to vote on the non-binding proposal regarding merger-related compensation for Chemtura's named
executive officers (assuming a quorum is present) or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit
additional proxies for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals.

Q: Will my shares held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold
of record? 

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you
hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own
shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will
receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an
individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. 

Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials? 

A: This means you own shares of Chemtura common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account.
For example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own
shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and
return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you
receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you
submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.

Q: Who will count the votes? 

A: A representative from Broadridge Investor Communications Services will serve as the inspector of election. 

Q: Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting? 

A: If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card or to vote
over the internet or by telephone. The special meeting will not be broadcast telephonically or over the internet. 

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 

A: Chemtura intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on
Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Chemtura files with the SEC are publicly
available when filed. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Chemtura stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, Chemtura stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Chemtura common stock in connection with the
merger. Instead, Chemtura will remain an independent public company and shares of Chemtura common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the NYSE and Euronext Paris. The merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement
under certain circumstances, Chemtura will be required to pay to Lanxess a termination fee of $75 million. See the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Chemtura" beginning on page 103 of this proxy statement for a discussion
of the circumstances under which such a termination fee will be required to be paid. 

Q: How can I obtain additional information about Chemtura? 

A: Chemtura will provide copies of this proxy statement and its 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, without charge to any stockholder who makes a written request to our
Corporate Secretary at Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury, Connecticut 06749. Chemtura's Annual Report on
Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on the Investors section of Chemtura's website at
www.chemtura.com. Chemtura's website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or
accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by reference by
this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement. 

Q: How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another
stockholder? 

A: The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for
proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single
annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as
"householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

Chemtura and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple stockholders who
request a copy and share an address, unless contrary

instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or
we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke
your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Chemtura if you are a
stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury,
Connecticut 06749 Attn: Corporate Secretary, or calling (203) 573-2000. Stockholders who share a single address, but receive
multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Chemtura at the
telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Chemtura will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to
the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a
single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

Q: Whom should I contact if I have any questions? 

A: If you have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire additional copies of this
proxy statement or additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you should contact:

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        This proxy statement is being provided to the stockholders of Chemtura as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Chemtura board for
use at the special meeting to be held at the time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an
adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides stockholders of Chemtura with the information they need to know to
be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place 

        The special meeting is scheduled to be held at the Pyramid Club, 1735 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103 on February 1, 2017 at
8:30 a.m., local time.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, Chemtura stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following:

• A proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled "The Merger"
and "The Merger Agreement," beginning on pages 32 and 83, respectively, of this proxy statement;

26



8/19/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091862/000104746916017306/a2230554zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

• A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed under the section entitled "The
Merger—Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 74 of this proxy
statement; and 

• A proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of
the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to
approve and adopt the merger agreement.

        Chemtura stockholders must approve and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If Chemtura stockholders fail to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the
merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to
approve the executive compensation payable in connection with the merger and vote not to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Chemtura or Lanxess.
Accordingly, because Chemtura is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is consummated, and regardless of the
outcome of the advisory vote.

        Chemtura does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
If any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however,
the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters.

Recommendation of the Chemtura Board of Directors 

        After careful consideration, the Chemtura board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby. Certain factors considered by the Chemtura board in reaching its decision to authorize and approve the merger
agreement and the merger can be found in the section entitled "The Merger—Chemtura's Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 54 of
this proxy statement.

        The Chemtura board unanimously recommends that the Chemtura stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or
may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and "FOR" the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote 

        Only holders of record of Chemtura common stock at the close of business on December 23, 2016, the record date for the special
meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At
the close of business on the record date, 63,001,260 shares of Chemtura common stock were issued and outstanding and held by 3,981
holders of record.

        Holders of record of Chemtura common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Chemtura common stock they own at the
close of business on the record date.

Quorum 

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Chemtura
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. Any shares of Chemtura common stock held
by Chemtura are not considered to be outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be
conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement and will subject Chemtura to additional expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for
the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special meeting. However, if a new record date is
set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if
you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

Required Vote 

        Approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote thereon. The proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further solicitation of
proxies, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present). The proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting (provided that a quorum is present).

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the
special meeting, abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present, and will be counted as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if necessary to permit further
solicitation of proxies, and the advisory vote on named executive officer merger-related compensation.

        If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy,
the proxy will be voted "FOR" (i) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; (ii) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger; and (iii) the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional
proxies, if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

        Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers and other record holders that are present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other record holder is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on
a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers and other record holders
do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial
owner of shares of Chemtura common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the broker or other holder of record,
then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. As a result, it is expected that there will not
be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement. If you do not instruct your broker,
bank or other nominee to vote

your shares, your shares will not be voted and the effect will be the same as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. However, a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote on the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting, including if necessary to solicit additional proxies for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement or, assuming a quorum
is present, the proposal regarding the advisory vote on named executive officer merger-related compensation will have no effect on the
outcome of such proposals.

Failure to Vote 

        If you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote over the internet, by telephone or in person,
your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
Questions concerning registered stockholders may be directed to our transfer agent, Computershare Inc., by telephone at (866) 233-4822
or by mail to P.O. Box 30170, College Station, TX 77842. If you are the record owner of your shares and you fail to vote, it will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement but will have no effect on the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), including if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, and the
advisory vote on named executive officer merger-related compensation (assuming a quorum is present).

Voting by Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on December 21, 2016, directors and executive officers of Chemtura and their affiliates were entitled to vote
1,628,094 shares of Chemtura common stock, or approximately 2.56% of the shares of Chemtura common stock issued and outstanding on
that date. We currently expect that Chemtura's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them is obligated to do so.

Voting at the Special Meeting 

        If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note that
if your shares of Chemtura common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you
must bring to the special meeting a proxy from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the shares of Chemtura common
stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

        You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by (i) signing, dating, completing and
returning the proxy card by mail; (ii) over the internet; or (iii) by telephone. Chemtura encourages you to vote over the internet as
Chemtura believes this is the most cost-effective method. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are
planning to attend the special meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. The internet provides a convenient, cost-effective
alternative to returning your proxy card by mail or voting by telephone. If you vote your shares over the internet, you may incur costs
associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from internet access providers. If you choose to vote your shares over the internet,
there is no need for you to mail back your proxy card.

To Vote Over the Internet:

To Vote By Mail:

        To vote by mail, complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card and mail it to the address indicated on the proxy card.

        If you return your signed proxy card without indicating how you want your shares of Chemtura common stock to be voted with
regard to a particular proposal, your shares of Chemtura common stock will be voted in favor of each such proposal. Proxy cards that are
returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting and cannot be voted.

        If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee
seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about
how to provide or revoke your instructions.

Revocation of Proxies

        You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If
you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:

• You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by telephone or by mail; 

• You may send a written notice prior to the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) that you are
revoking your proxy to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury,
Connecticut 06749. 

• You may attend the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and vote in person. Simply attending the
special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.

        If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank
or other nominee to revoke your proxy.

        If you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact the Corporate Secretary, by telephone at (203) 573-

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The Chemtura board is soliciting your proxy, and Chemtura will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Morrow has been retained to assist
with the solicitation of proxies. Morrow will be paid approximately $10,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of
proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of
Chemtura common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be
solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by Morrow or, without additional compensation,
by certain of Chemtura's directors, officers and employees.

Adjournment 

        In addition to the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the advisory vote on named executive officer merger-
related compensation, Chemtura stockholders are also being asked to approve a proposal to, as permitted under the terms of the merger
agreement, adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If this
proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by Chemtura. In addition, Chemtura could postpone the meeting before it
commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other reasons. If the special meeting is adjourned for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time
prior to their use at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you
wish to vote on any proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of such proposal.

        If a quorum does not exist at the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), under our bylaws, the holders of a
majority of the shares of Chemtura common stock entitled to vote thereat present at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy,
may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time, or the chairman of the meeting, our Chief Executive Officer, or our
president may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time. If a quorum exists, but there are not enough affirmative votes to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, the special meeting may be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting.

        The Chemtura board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if
necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Other Information 

        You should not send documents representing Chemtura common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the exchange
agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of Chemtura common stock for the
merger consideration.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1) 

        The discussion of the merger in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which
is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should read the merger
agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Effects of the Merger 

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into
Chemtura, with Chemtura surviving the merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess.

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Chemtura common stock (other than any shares held by Chemtura,
Lanxess, Merger Subsidiary, any other wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess or Chemtura, or any stockholder who has properly demanded
and not validly withdrawn rights of appraisal in accordance with Delaware law) will be automatically converted into the right to receive
$33.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

        Upon consummation of the merger, your shares of Chemtura common stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and cease to exist in exchange for payment of the per share merger consideration described above unless you have properly
demanded and not validly withdrawn rights of appraisal in accordance with Delaware law. As a result, you will not own any shares of the
surviving corporation, and you will no longer have any interest in its future earnings or growth. As a result of the merger, Chemtura will
cease to be a publicly traded company and will be indirectly wholly owned by Lanxess. Following consummation of the merger, the
surviving corporation will terminate the registration of our common stock on the NYSE and Euronext Paris and we will no longer be
subject to reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.

        Upon consummation of the merger, vested equity-based and long-term cash awards held by Chemtura's officers, employees and non-
employee directors will be cashed out, and unvested awards will be converted into deferred cash awards, in each case based on the merger
consideration of $33.50 per share.

        In the event that, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger, Chemtura takes certain actions to
change the number of shares of its common stock outstanding, including by split, combination or reclassification, or pays any dividend on
or makes any distribution of common stock, then any number or amount in the merger agreement, which is based on the price or number
of shares of common stock, including the merger consideration, will be adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or change.

Effects on Chemtura If the Merger Is Not Completed 

        If the merger agreement is not adopted by Chemtura stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Chemtura
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Chemtura will remain an independent
public company. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Chemtura expects that management will operate Chemtura's business in a
manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that Chemtura stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive specialty chemicals
industry in which Chemtura operates and adverse economic conditions.

        Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be
completed, it is likely that the price of Chemtura's common stock will

decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Chemtura common stock would return to the price at
which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

        Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of your shares of Chemtura common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Chemtura board will continue to evaluate and review
Chemtura's business operations, properties, dividend policy, share repurchases and capitalization, among other things, make such changes
as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. If the merger agreement is
not approved and adopted by Chemtura stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that
any other transaction acceptable to Chemtura will be offered or that Chemtura's business, prospects or results of operation will not be
adversely impacted.

        In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Chemtura would be required to pay Lanxess a
termination fee in an amount equal to $75 million. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by Chemtura" beginning on
page 103 of this proxy statement.

Background of the Merger 

        Beginning in 2011, the Chemtura board, working with members of Chemtura's senior management, began a strategic assessment of
Chemtura's businesses, focusing on their operational and financial performance and their fit within Chemtura's long-term strategic goals
and plans. During its deliberation, the Chemtura board also considered possible acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.
Beginning in 2012, the Chemtura board directed senior management of Chemtura to explore the divestiture of certain of Chemtura's non-
core businesses, which resulted in the sales of its Antioxidants business in April 2013 and its Consumer Products business in December
2013. In early 2014, the Chemtura board, after exploring acquisition transactions in the agrochemicals space and recognizing valuations
were high, came to believe that its Chemtura AgroSolutions business likely maintained a valuation that was superior to other businesses
owned by Chemtura, instructed senior management to explore the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business in order to unlock value
from the business and return the proceeds to Chemtura stockholders and for other corporate uses. As a result, Chemtura completed the sale
of its Chemtura AgroSolutions business in November 2014. Proceeds from this and the 2013 divestitures were used to pay down debt and
to repurchase shares of Chemtura's common stock, including through a cash tender offer for approximately 14.5% of the then outstanding
common stock, which was completed in December 2014.

        During the course of these divestitures, the Chemtura board and the senior management team continued to review and assess
Chemtura's businesses, long-term strategic goals and plans, including potential opportunities to maximize stockholder value through
business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.

        In its discussions during 2014 regarding the long-term strategy of Chemtura, the Chemtura board took note of several issues
confronting Chemtura, including: (i) that the successful implementation of Chemtura's portfolio rationalization strategy had achieved the
goal of providing Chemtura with a tightly-focused portfolio of four industrial specialty chemical businesses, but had left Chemtura as one
of the smaller specialty chemical companies and that senior management had advised the Chemtura board that in order to have the
capacity to invest in significant product and application innovation and growth, Chemtura needed the benefits of scale; (ii) that while other
companies in the specialty chemicals industry had expressed interest in some of Chemtura's remaining portfolio businesses, any further
divestiture would risk reducing Chemtura's enterprise value to a level that could depress its enterprise value multiple, thereby reducing
rather than increasing shareholder value; (iii) that developments in the bromine industry over the prior three years had created excess
bromine capacity, thereby depressing bromine prices, that it was not evident that bromine customer demand would grow

Table of Contents

at a rate to return to a supply-demand equilibrium in the next five years and that Chemtura's bromine profit margins and return on
investment were likely to remain depressed absent some change in the industry; and (iv) that, while management had continued to find
opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies, including the program to reduce manufacturing costs in 2015 being
planned at that time, the opportunities for such improvements would diminish and Chemtura needed revenue growth to drive continued
profit growth. The Chemtura board also considered the receipt of an unsolicited, inbound preliminary expression of interest from Party A
that included no specific terms regarding value or deal structure, which resulted in the Chemtura board beginning to focus more closely on
the potential opportunities associated with the potential sale of Chemtura, the potential risks and opportunities presented by a potential
transformative acquisition by Chemtura and the potential risks and opportunities associated with continuing to operate Chemtura as a
stand-alone company.

        On July 17, 2014, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled telephonic meeting at which all directors were present. In an
executive session, the Chemtura board discussed with senior management certain potential strategic alternatives for Chemtura and the
potential engagement of a financial advisor to assist the Chemtura board in the evaluation of such alternatives. During this session, the
Chemtura board concluded that Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") should assist Chemtura in light of Morgan Stanley's
qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of both the industries in and companies with which Chemtura operates and the
business and affairs of Chemtura. In addition, the Chemtura board expressed confidence in Morgan Stanley given the Chemtura Board's
experience working with the financial advisory team of Morgan Stanley on the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business.

        On August 21, 2014, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled telephonic meeting at which all directors, except one, were
present, together with members of Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives of Morgan Stanley
were in attendance and reviewed a series of financial analyses of Chemtura and provided an overview of potential strategic alternatives for
Chemtura, including execution of Chemtura's standalone plan, the sale of the company, a merger or business combination and the breakup
of the company.

        To support Morgan Stanley's financial analysis, the Chemtura board instructed Morgan Stanley to utilize Chemtura's existing long
range forecast of financial performance for fiscal years 2014-2018. In the ordinary course of business, Chemtura's management annually
updates Chemtura's long range forecasts and budgets. Chemtura's long range forecast of financial performance for fiscal years 2014-2018,
like other forecasts and budgets prepared by Chemtura's management reflected certain assumptions, risks and key drivers which were
developed by senior management and reviewed with the Chemtura board. The long range forecast of financial performance for fiscal years
2014-2018, like other forecasts and budgets prepared by Chemtura's senior management, was developed by the Chemtura senior
management team as a tool for setting challenging targets for financial performance that would "stretch" management to achieve revenue
growth, innovation targets, new product sales and strong earnings and cash flows, not for the purpose of providing Chemtura's
management's best estimate of Chemtura's financial performance or for the purpose of conducting a valuation analysis of Chemtura. As a
result, Chemtura's actual financial performance had historically fallen well below its long range forecasts.

        In a series of discussions following Morgan Stanley's review, the Chemtura board concluded that Chemtura should stay focused on
closing its announced sale of its Chemtura AgroSolutions business (the closing of which occurred on November 3, 2014) and
implementing certain restructuring and capital structure rationalization efforts, rather than embark on the further exploration of other
strategic alternatives at this time.

        Beginning in the fall of 2014 and continuing until the fall of 2015, Chemtura's management had periodic conversations with Party B
regarding a potential strategic transaction or joint venture that

34



8/19/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091862/000104746916017306/a2230554zdefm14a.htm

would combine Chemtura's Industrial Engineered Products ("IEP") business segment with a complementary business of Party B.
Ultimately, such discussions did not progress due to the companies' determination that such a transaction would likely be challenged by
applicable antitrust authorities.

        On January 15, 2015, the Chemtura board held an in person special meeting at which all directors were present except for one, along
with members of Chemtura's senior management. At this meeting, Craig Rogerson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Chemtura, and Stephen Forsyth, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Chemtura, made a presentation to the Chemtura
board regarding the recent performance of Chemtura's businesses and the benefits to the company of exploring potential strategic
alternatives. Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth advised the Chemtura board that a meeting had been scheduled with Morgan Stanley at which,
subject to the Chemtura board's approval, management planned to discuss identifying potential counterparties and exploring potential
strategic transactions involving Chemtura. Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth explained that the purpose of any outreach to potential
counterparties would not expressly focus on a sale of the company, although proposals to acquire all of Chemtura would be considered.
Instead, potential counterparties would be engaged to discuss a variety of possible transactions, including divestitures, joint acquisitions
and joint ventures. In addition, Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth specifically provided an overview to the Chemtura board of a number of
potential transformative acquisition transactions for Chemtura that had each been identified by separate investment banks that approached
management: a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (i.e., a complex tax-efficient transaction structured as a spin-off or split-off of a portion of
one party's business immediately followed by a stock-for-stock merger of such spun-off or split-off entity with the counterparty) with Party
C and an acquisition of Party D. At this time, there was also discussion between Chemtura's management and Party E through a financial
advisor about another potential Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Party E.

        After a discussion, the Chemtura board concluded that, while it had made no decision with respect to the potential sale of Chemtura
or any other potential strategic alternative, it was in the best interests of Chemtura and its stockholders for management to explore a
variety of strategic alternatives, including by meeting with Morgan Stanley, exploring transactions with Party C and Party D and following
up on the previously received unsolicited proposal from Party A (as described below). The Chemtura board also authorized management
to reach out to a targeted group of 14 financial sponsors, including Parties F, G and H, and 24 strategic third parties, including Party I,
Party J and Lanxess, regarding interest in a variety of potential strategic transactions with Chemtura, which list was provided by Morgan
Stanley in anticipation of its meeting with Chemtura's management. Morgan Stanley developed this list based on the parties that Morgan
Stanley and management considered likely to have both the strategic interest and financial capability to complete a strategic transaction
with Chemtura.

        Over the weeks following the January 15, 2015 Chemtura board meeting, at the direction of the Chemtura board, Morgan Stanley
conducted an outreach to the financial sponsors and strategic third parties identified by Morgan Stanley with input from Chemtura's
management. Certain strategic third parties were excluded from the Morgan Stanley outreach as Chemtura had previously established
dialog with those parties through other investment banks or financial advisory firms. This outreach included Party J, Party G, Party H and
Lanxess, though Lanxess at that time did not enter into a discussion with Chemtura. This initial outreach resulted in 13 parties executing
confidentiality agreements that included customary "standstill" provisions, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibited a potential
counterparty from acquiring shares of Chemtura common stock or taking certain other actions but which did not contain so-called "don't
ask to waive" provisions which would prohibit the counterparty from requesting that Chemtura waive the "standstill" provision. Of these
13 parties that entered into confidentiality agreements, all, including Parties G, H and J, received information that included a written
management presentation and selected portions of Chemtura's long range forecast of financial performance for fiscal years 2015-2018. In
addition, 12 of these parties attended management presentations with Chemtura's management over the course of the subsequent few
months.

        During this same period, Chemtura's discussion of a potential transaction with Party C ended when Party C was acquired, preventing
the contemplated Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Further, Party E advised Chemtura that it had decided to spin-out to its shareholders
the business that created the potential for a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Chemtura. In addition, based on analysis of the strategic
fit with Chemtura, and guidance received from its financial advisor as to the probable purchase price that would be required to acquire
Party D, Chemtura management concluded it would not attempt to acquire Party D.

        Also in January 2015, Chemtura's management initiated conversations with Party K regarding a potential strategic transaction
between Chemtura and Party K. Members of Chemtura's management had sporadic conversations with Party K during the course of the
winter and spring of 2015, with conversations eventually evolving away from a strategic transaction and toward a potential contractual
supply relationship between Chemtura and Party K. In the fall of 2015, Party K ultimately decided not to pursue such a potential
transaction or relationship with Chemtura.

        On February 4, 2015, Mr. Rogerson received a phone call from the Chief Executive Officer of Party A, who preliminarily suggested
that Party A would be willing to pay $500 million for Chemtura's IEP segment and potentially $25 to $26 per share for the entire company,
subject to due diligence and certain assumptions regarding Adjusted EBITDA of Chemtura and the IEP segment. Although Party A's offer
represented only a modest (3.9% to 8.0%) premium to Chemtura's then-current share price ($24.07), Chemtura's management invited Party
A to sign a confidentiality agreement, to receive due diligence information about Chemtura (including by attending a management
presentation with Chemtura's management) and to make a non-binding written proposal to Chemtura along with the other financial
sponsors and strategic third parties with which it was currently engaged.

        On February 5, 2015 Chemtura held an Investor Day in New York City that was attended by investors and analysts in person as well
as via webcast. In prepared remarks, Mr. Rogerson reviewed with the attendees the value that had been created for Chemtura's
shareholders by Chemtura's portfolio transformation strategy that had led to the successful divestiture of the Antioxidants, Consumer
Products and Chemtura AgroSolutions businesses and that such divestitures enabled the substantial share repurchase program that
Chemtura continued to implement. Mr. Rogerson also summarized the value that was expected to be created by the 2015 cost reduction
actions that were being implemented by members of Chemtura's management. He then reviewed Chemtura's conclusion that, in order to
enable accelerated value creation for Chemtura's shareholders, Chemtura needed to increase its scale, as it was unlikely that further value
could be created by divesting any of Chemtura's remaining four businesses. Mr. Rogerson expressed the view that Chemtura was agnostic
as to how it gained scale, whether through Chemtura being acquired by a larger specialty chemical company, a merger with a comparable-
sized specialty chemical company or Chemtura's acquisition of a complementary specialty chemical company. Mr. Rogerson advised
attendees at the meeting that Chemtura would seek "buy, sell, merge" opportunities and select the option that would create the greatest
accelerated value for Chemtura stockholders.

        On February 19, 2015, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled in person meeting at which all members of the Chemtura board
were in attendance, along with members of senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives of Morgan
Stanley were also in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the status of its outreach efforts, which while
still underway, to date had not yielded any concrete proposals with respect to any form of strategic transaction.

        On February 23, 2015, during Chemtura's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call, Mr. Rogerson further discussed
Chemtura's "buy, sell, merge" strategy, indicating to investors that while Chemtura would continue to seek to create value in 2015 through
its cost reduction program, one of the significant medium-term headwinds that Chemtura faced was a lack of scale.

        During the months of March and April 2015, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of Chemtura's management
engaged in conversations and met a number of times with the financial sponsors and strategic third parties identified by Morgan Stanley,
but no such conversations yielded any concrete proposals with respect to a strategic transaction.

        On April 30, 2015, during Chemtura's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call, Mr. Rogerson reiterated to investors that Chemtura
was "continuing to explore how [it] can accelerate value creation for [its] shareholders [through] the next transformational move for
Chemtura."

        On May 7, 2015, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled in person meeting at which all directors were present, along with
members of Chemtura's senior management. At the Chemtura board's invitation, representatives from Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk &
Wardwell, LLP, Chemtura's outside counsel ("Davis Polk"), were also in attendance. Chemtura's senior management updated the Chemtura
board on the year-to-date performance of Chemtura's various businesses and business segments, which performance had been strong (but
had not met the performance targeted in Chemtura's annual budget for 2015 for the reasons stated above concerning the purposes of those
targets), in large part due to the initial benefits of its 2015 cost reduction actions, which had resulted in an increase to earnings. Next,
representatives of Morgan Stanley reported to the Chemtura board on the status of its outreach to potential financial and strategic
counterparties for a strategic transaction. Generally, the parties contacted, including Lanxess, Party A and Party I, had expressed no interest
in acquiring Chemtura at a premium to its then-current share price, which was near its high price ($29.77 per share) since Chemtura's exit
from bankruptcy in 2010, including because many believed the then-current share price already reflected a transaction premium and a
premium related to expected future price increases in bromine. However, several of the financial sponsors, including Party A and Party L,
had contacted Chemtura to express interest in Chemtura's IEP segment or Chemtura's Great Lakes Solutions business, and several of the
strategic buyers contacted expressed interest in an acquisition involving all or some of the assets constituting Chemtura's Industrial
Performance Products ("IPP") business segment. For instance, Party I, which was initially contacted to discuss an all-stock acquisition,
indicated that it would be unable to justify acquiring all or part of Chemtura at a valuation that reflected an attractive premium to
Chemtura's current stock price, because while Party I had a high level of interest in the IPP side of Chemtura's business, Party I was
concerned that Chemtura's IEP business segment was not a good strategic fit with its existing business. Party A had previously provided a
nonbinding expression of interest for the IEP segment, including the Great Lakes Solutions business, but Party L did not provide an
expression of interest after conducting limited diligence and having a number of discussions with management.

        During the same meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley also updated the Chemtura board on a meeting held with Party J on
April 16, 2015, at which Party J had expressed an interest in acquiring Chemtura's IPP segment but not its IEP segment. The Chemtura
board discussed the potential for a transaction with Party J involving the IPP segment and instructed management and Morgan Stanley to
ask Party J to provide a non-binding indication of value for the IPP segment in order to determine whether to proceed further given the
current trading price of Chemtura. Chemtura's management also noted that any transaction for the IPP segment only would potentially
result in a large tax cost for Chemtura. Chemtura's tax basis in its businesses was low relative to the fair value of the businesses due to
Chemtura having been formed though a sequence of mergers, such that the basis in the assets obtained through mergers had not been
stepped up to the merger values. While Chemtura had significant net operating losses, the rate at which it could utilize them was limited
under Section 382 of the Code. In 2014, Chemtura had utilized all net operating losses available at that time under that limitation in the
sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions. As a result, a sale of portions of the company in 2015 could result in a sizable taxable gain to Chemtura
that could not be significantly offset at the time of sale by utilization of net operating losses. The Chemtura board also discussed potential
value creation strategies including a tax free spin-off of the IEP segment, which was ultimately not pursued

given concerns around whether the spin could proceed on a tax free basis. Management then reviewed with the Chemtura board a new
potential Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Party M which had been proposed to Chemtura by an investment bank with which
Chemtura had a relationship. Mr. Rogerson subsequently met with the CEO of Party M, who expressed a willingness to explore the
transaction once Party M had completed its current strategic planning process. However, the Reverse Morris Trust transaction ultimately
was not pursued as Party M entered into an agreement to be acquired later in 2015.

        On June 4, 2015, Bloomberg Media reported that at a chemical industry conference, Mr. Rogerson indicated that Chemtura was
pursuing a "buy, sell or merge" strategy and was open to considering a sale of the entire company, indicating that "there is a lot of interest
in the company and the portfolio." Mr. Rogerson indicated that a formal sale process may develop if Chemtura were to procure a
commitment from a buyer for one part of Chemtura or a specific asset and needed to solicit buyers for the remainder. Mr. Rogerson, when
asked to name an investment banker working with Chemtura, named a senior investment banker at Morgan Stanley.

        On June 17, 2015, Party J provided a proposal to acquire certain assets of Chemtura's IPP segment for $1.5 billion. In the transaction
proposed by Party J, all pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, would be retained by Chemtura and all pension and
employee benefits would be fully funded by Chemtura at Closing. At the Board's direction, Morgan Stanley communicated to Party J that
its proposal was inadequate and reflected a price and a structure (with Party J acquiring select assets and assuming no liabilities) that was
not attractive to Chemtura. Party J responded by indicating that it believed that Chemtura's financial forecasts with respect to the IPP
segment, reflected in Chemtura's long range forecast of financial performance for fiscal years 2015-2018, were overly optimistic, and thus,
a higher valuation was not warranted. Morgan Stanley also discussed with Party J whether there was additional due diligence information
that could be provided by Chemtura that would have the effect of causing Party J to increase the price or change the structure of its offer.
In the weeks to come, Chemtura provided additional information at the request of Party J, including mid-year 2015 operating results for
the IPP segment, which were positive.

        Also in June 2015, Chemtura's management had discussions with representatives of the management team of Party N relating to a
strategic transaction involving Chemtura's Great Lakes Solutions business. Chemtura and Party N executed a confidentiality agreement
that included a customary "standstill" provision but no "don't ask to waive" provision and exchanged certain due diligence information
with respect to Party N's business and Chemtura's Great Lakes Solutions business. Chemtura and Party N continued periodic discussions
through the early fall of 2015, but Party N ultimately determined not to pursue the potential transaction further.

        On July 16, 2015, the Chemtura board held an in person, regularly scheduled meeting where all members of the Chemtura board were
in attendance, along with members of Chemtura's senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives of Morgan
Stanley were also in attendance. Senior management reported to the Chemtura board on preliminary June and second quarter 2015
operating results, which came in lower than targeted in Chemtura's 2015 annual budget for the period but reflected significant
improvement compared to 2014 performance (adjusted to exclude the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and related divestiture expenses).
Senior management also reported on ongoing 2015 cost reduction actions, which were resulting in significant cost savings. Next,
representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Chemtura board the terms of Party J's June 17, 2015 offer and the status of
discussions with Party J and the other parties contacted to date. Given that Party J had not changed or otherwise improved its offer, the
Chemtura board again determined that the price and terms offered by Party J were inadequate.

        At the July 16, 2015 board meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley again noted that while there had been some interest expressed
for Chemtura's IEP or IPP business segments separately, none

of the parties contacted had expressed interest in acquiring the entire company due to several factors, including Chemtura's then-current
share price ($27.36 per share), which was trading near its post-bankruptcy high. As a result, Morgan Stanley suggested allowing potential
counterparties to work together to develop an attractive transaction proposal for the acquisition of Chemtura as a whole. The Chemtura
board discussed and asked questions about the status of the outreach to date and agreed that, at least in limited circumstances, it would be
sensible to allow potential counterparties to work together to develop attractive acquisition proposals, which could be designed to mitigate
the effect of the tax liabilities that would arise by selling the IPP segment but retaining the IEP segment. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley also led a discussion regarding various potential value creation strategies involving the IEP and IPP segments, including a tax free
spin-off of the IEP segment, but after a discussion and careful consideration of these strategies, ultimately, the Chemtura board determined
not to pursue any of these strategies.

        On July 30, 2015, during Chemtura's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call, Mr. Rogerson reiterated to investors that
Chemtura was seeking options for acquisitions, a sale or a merger.

        On August 12, 2015, in an attempt to develop an attractive acquisition proposal, Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth met with
representatives of Party F to suggest that Party F explore a partnership opportunity with Party J to acquire Chemtura's IEP segment.
Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth approached Party F due to its indication of interest in acquiring only the IEP segment when Party F was
initially contacted by Morgan Stanley in the spring of 2015. Chemtura and Party F executed a confidentiality agreement that included a
customary "standstill" provision but no "don't ask to waive" provision on September 8, 2015, and members of Chemtura's management
and representatives of Morgan Stanley met or spoke with representatives of Party F on September 24 and 29, 2015 and October 14 and 23,
2015 to discuss the opportunity and the information provided by Chemtura. Following these discussions, Morgan Stanley introduced
representatives of Party F and representatives of Party J with the goal of spurring discussions of a joint proposal for the acquisition of
Chemtura and the subsequent division of its businesses between Party F and Party J.

        Morgan Stanley also conducted a variety of secondary outreach to parties that were first contacted in the spring of 2015 as part of
Morgan Stanley's initial outreach to financial sponsors and strategic third parties, including in an attempt to suggest partners for various
potential third parties to allow them to make attractive acquisition proposals. These efforts resulted in no concrete proposals related to
potential strategic transactions.

        On October 8, 2015, the Chemtura board held an in person regularly scheduled meeting where all members of the Chemtura board
were in attendance, along with members of Chemtura senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from
Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk were also in attendance. Mr. Forsyth led the Chemtura board through a review of the financial
performance of the business in the third quarter of 2015. He indicated that although the financial performance of the Company was lower
than targeted in Chemtura's 2015 annual budget, Chemtura showed improvement compared to the second quarter of 2015, as Chemtura's
margins were expanding as a result of higher bromine prices, lower raw materials costs and lower spending due in large part to Chemtura's
cost reduction efforts. Morgan Stanley summarized its discussions to date with Party J and Party F, as well as its secondary outreach to
parties that were first contacted in the spring of 2015.

        Over the course of the remainder of 2015, Chemtura and Morgan Stanley continued discussions with Party J and Party F regarding a
potential transaction. However, these discussions terminated when Party J and Party F failed to agree on a mutually acceptable valuation of
Chemtura as a whole that they believed would be acceptable to Chemtura.

        In October 2015, a financial advisory firm indicated to Chemtura's management that Party O might consider divesting a business that
could complement Chemtura's IPP segment. Chemtura's management requested that this advisory firm approach Party O and express
Chemtura's interest in this business.

Party O responded positively to Chemtura's interest in November 2015 and a meeting between Chemtura's management and
representatives of Party O's management was scheduled for early December 2015. This meeting was later postponed due to an acquisition
opportunity being pursued by Party O.

        On October 28, 2015, during Chemtura's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call, Mr. Rogerson reaffirmed that Chemtura was
exploring options for acquisitions, a sale or a merger.

        In November of 2015, Morgan Stanley received an inquiry from Party P, which expressed preliminary interest in acquiring
Chemtura's IPP segment, excluding certain assets related to the urethanes business, but which did not contain any detail on the proposed
value of such a transaction. Chemtura and Party P entered into a confidentiality agreement that included a customary "standstill" provision
but no "don't ask to waive" provision in November 2015 and Party P began receiving diligence information from Chemtura in early
December 2015. In subsequent conversations, Party P indicated that it would be open to exploring a transaction for all of Chemtura's IPP
business segment, but talks between Chemtura and Party P did not progress beyond preliminary discussions due, in part, to Party P's
management's focus on an unrelated transaction that Party P announced in the spring of 2016.

        On November 12, 2015, representatives of Chemtura and Lanxess met in Philadelphia to discuss how the two companies might
cooperate with each other regarding certain potential transactions though an acquisition of Chemtura by Lanxess was not then discussed.

        On December 10, 2015, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled in person meeting where all directors were in attendance,
along with members of Chemtura senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Morgan Stanley and
Davis Polk were also in attendance. Mr. Forsyth updated the Chemtura board on the financial performance of Chemtura for the fourth
quarter of 2015 to date, which was improved compared to the same period in the prior year but was below the levels indicated in
Chemtura's 2015 annual budget. He also provided an update on its 2015 restructuring and cost saving programs, which were now complete
and delivering the projected benefits. Next, Morgan Stanley updated the Chemtura board on the status of its ongoing outreach to potential
counterparties for strategic transactions, including recent discussions with Parties F, J and P, noting that none of the outreach to date had
resulted in a concrete proposal that proposed a definitive value for all or part of Chemtura's business or that otherwise merited evaluation
by the Chemtura board.

        Mr. Forsyth then led the Chemtura board through a presentation on potential new opportunities to consider with respect to strategic
transactions. The presentation focused on potentially adding another industrial specialty chemicals business to Chemtura's portfolio. He
reported that Chemtura's management had evaluated four potential targets, but did not recommend pursuing any of them, given that
management did not believe such targets were a good fit with Chemtura's existing businesses. Mr. Forsyth also noted that an investment
bank had proposed to Chemtura on a number of occasions over the last three years that Party Q might be a potential acquisition target and
had undertaken analysis on behalf of the company on this opportunity and others that the investment bank had proposed. He reported that
the investment bank had recently proposed to Chemtura in light of its comments on its "buy, sell, merge" strategy that Party Q could be a
potential merger candidate. Management proposed to the Chemtura board that this investment bank approach Party Q to gauge its interest.
Mr. Forsyth also indicated that Chemtura's management anticipated that the rescheduled meeting with Party O would occur in January
2016. The Chemtura board discussed and asked questions regarding the various potential acquisitions under consideration and the
potential merger with Party Q. The Chemtura board directed management to continue exploring potential acquisitions and a transaction
with Party Q.

        The investment bank that suggested a merger transaction between Chemtura and Party Q approached Party Q in mid-December 2015.
Party Q expressed interest in such a transaction, and a meeting was scheduled between Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth and the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Party Q.

        On December 16, 2015, during Chemtura's investor day presentations to shareholders, Mr. Rogerson indicated to investors that
Chemtura was seeking options for acquisitions, a sale or a merger that were actionable in the near-term.

        On January 6, 2016, Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Party Q met in
person. The parties discussed a potential merger of equals transaction between Chemtura and Party Q.

        Over the following days, members of Chemtura's management and Party Q's management held discussions and agreed that the
management teams of each company should meet in February 2016 to provide each other with management presentations to assist with
determining whether Chemtura and Party Q should further explore the potential of a merger. The discussions then focused on agreeing on
the content of the management presentations.

        On January 13, 2016, Chemtura executed a confidentiality agreement with Party Q that did not include a "standstill" provision.

        In January and February 2016, the financial advisory firm that had contacted Chemtura's management regarding a potential
transaction with Party O sought, on behalf of Chemtura's management, to reschedule the meeting between Chemtura and Party O.
Eventually, Party O informed the financial advisory firm that it had concluded to undertake an auction process for the business that had
been the subject of Chemtura's interest and that they would invite Chemtura to participate in the process once launched.

        On February 10 and 11, 2016, members of senior management of Chemtura and Party Q met in person to present on each of the
companies' respective businesses and to explore potential synergies that could be achieved in a merger of the companies. Following these
meetings, on February 18, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of Party Q called Mr. Rogerson to advise him that Party Q's board of
directors had met and was interested in proceeding further in exploring a potential merger of the companies.

        On February 19, 2016, the Chemtura board held an in person regularly scheduled meeting with representatives from Chemtura senior
management present. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also present. Members of
management made a presentation to the Chemtura board on the business of Party Q and also presented a financial model of the pro forma
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and enterprise value of a combined Chemtura and Party Q, relying on
publicly available financial information on Party Q supplemented by information garnered from their management presentation to
Chemtura and Chemtura's forecast of financial performance for the years 2017-2019 that was finalized in early January 2016 (the "Pre-
Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast"). Like other forecasts prepared by Chemtura's management, the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast reflected certain assumptions, risks and key drivers which were developed by senior management and reviewed with and
approved by the Chemtura board, which assumptions, risks and key drivers are more fully described in "—Chemtura Pre-Risk Adjusted
Long Range Forecast" below. The Chemtura board then discussed the potential transaction with Party Q and asked questions about the
presentation. After deliberations, the Chemtura board instructed management to proceed in exploring a potential merger transaction with
Party Q.

        On February 23, 2016, during Chemtura's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call, Mr. Rogerson indicated to investors that
Chemtura's "focus is on finding a transaction that fits our strategic criteria and that is actionable in the near-term," with the intent of
accelerating value creation

for Chemtura's stockholders and reaffirmed that Chemtura was seeking options for acquisitions, a sale or a merger.

        On March 2, 2016, Mr. Rogerson and the Chief Executive Officer of Party Q met in person to discuss feedback from their respective
board meetings, potential synergies and deal structure. The Chief Executive Officer of Party Q indicated that he envisioned a merger of
equals transaction with an exchange ratio that would be set at the market price of each of the companies' common stock. Although Party Q
was smaller than Chemtura, he indicated that Party Q desired equal representation on the board of directors of the combined company, that
Party Q expected that Party Q's current Chief Executive Officer would serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and
that Mr. Rogerson would serve as Executive Chairman of the combined company.

        On March 17, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting at which all of the directors were present, as well as
members of Chemtura senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also in
attendance. Chemtura's management briefed the Chemtura board on the status of conversations with Party Q and estimates of potential
synergies. Mr. Rogerson also updated the Chemtura board regarding some of the key terms of the merger of equals transaction outlined by
the Chief Executive Officer of Party Q including a proposal that the Chief Executive Officer of Party Q would serve as a Chief Executive
Officer of the combined company. After asking questions and discussion, the Chemtura board directed management to continue
discussions with Party Q regarding a potential combination of Chemtura and Party Q, including on terms which contemplated the Chief
Executive Officer of Party Q serving as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company.

        Over the coming weeks, Chemtura's management and Party Q's management engaged in discussions both in person and via
teleconference regarding potential synergies and transaction terms.

        On March 29, 2016, Mr. Rogerson met in person with representatives from Parties G and H who were first contacted in Spring of
2015 and had expressed renewed interest in jointly acquiring Chemtura in an all cash transaction. Subsequent to such meeting, Chemtura
and Parties G and H entered into new confidentiality agreements that included customary "standstill" provisions but did not include a
"don't ask to waive" provision, and Chemtura began sharing due diligence information with Parties G and H. At the initial meeting,
Parties G and H indicated that they expected to be in a position to deliver a non-binding indication of interest regarding a potential
acquisition of Chemtura by April 13, 2016 (a day prior to the next scheduled meeting of the Chemtura board). However, Parties G and H
did not deliver a non-binding indication of interest by that Chemtura board meeting, explaining that they needed more information to
conduct their valuation analysis.

        On April 6, 2016, Mr. Rogerson met with representatives of Lanxess to follow up on their November 12, 2015 discussions on how
Chemtura and Lanxess might cooperate with each other. At the meeting, Lanxess indicated that they viewed Chemtura as a potential
strategic acquisition target and expressed interest in acquiring Chemtura in an all cash transaction. On April 11, 2016, Chemtura and
Lanxess entered into a confidentiality agreement that included a customary "standstill" provision but did not include a "don't ask to waive"
provision, and Chemtura provided preliminary due diligence information about Chemtura to Lanxess.

        On April 14, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting at which all directors were present, along with members of
Chemtura senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were in attendance. Mr. Forsyth
led the Chemtura board through a review of the financial performance of the business in the first quarter of 2016. He indicated that while
net sales were lower than those targeted in the 2016 annual budget for the period (the first year of the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast) and during the same period in the prior year, earnings were higher than targeted in the 2016 annual budget for the period and
reported in the same period in the prior year. He attributed this earnings growth to lower costs of raw materials and lower

operating costs. Mr. Forsyth also noted that bromine pricing continued to be strong. Next, Mr. Forsyth presented an illustrative financial
analysis regarding a potential merger of equals transaction with Party Q, assuming market valuations as of April 11, 2016 and an at-the-
market exchange ratio. Mr. Forsyth led a discussion with the Chemtura board about the financial position of a combined Party Q and
Chemtura.

        Next, Mr. Rogerson reported to the Chemtura board on his conversations with Parties G and H, including that Parties G and H had
not, individually or jointly, provided a non-binding indication of interest on the requested timeline. Mr. Rogerson noted that Chemtura
intended to provide Parties G and H with additional due diligence information in the coming week to assist them in developing a definitive
offer for Chemtura. Mr. Rogerson also reported to the Chemtura board on his conversations with Lanxess and noted that management from
both Chemtura and Lanxess were scheduled to meet in person in the coming week. Next, representatives from Davis Polk reviewed with
the Chemtura board its fiduciary duties, including those applicable to its consideration of potential strategic transactions and a sale of the
company. In addition, Davis Polk reviewed the situations in which it would be warranted to consider creating a special committee of the
Board to evaluate a strategic transaction. The Chemtura board asked questions regarding and discussed these topics. At the advice of Davis
Polk, the Chemtura board determined that it was not then warranted to create a special committee to evaluate the potential transaction with
Party Q, Parties G and H or Lanxess, but the Board recognized that this analysis could change as these transactions evolved.

        Finally, the Chemtura board discussed the various potential transactions all being considered at the same time, including whether and
under what circumstances the Chemtura board would put a hold on negotiations of any of the transactions under consideration by the
Chemtura board. After discussion, the Chemtura board directed management to continue further discussions with each of Party Q, Lanxess
and Parties G and H regarding the potential transactions presented by each.

        On April 20, 2016, representatives of Chemtura's management met with Lanxess to review a management presentation and respond to
due diligence questions. Further due diligence information was provided to Lanxess as a follow-up to this meeting.

        On April 21, 2016, representatives of Chemtura's management met with Parties G and H to review a management presentation and
respond to due diligence questions. Further due diligence information was provided to Parties G and H as a follow-up to this meeting.

        On April 26, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of Party Q discussed the overall status of a transaction with Party Q with
Mr. Rogerson. The Chief Executive Officer of Party Q indicated that Party Q was engaged in due diligence related to a material acquisition
with another unrelated company (the "Party Q Acquisition") that Party Q would prefer to undertake prior to entering into any transaction
with Chemtura, which would delay full engagement between Party Q and Chemtura on a potential merger of equals transaction for up to
several months. The Chief Executive Officer of Party Q indicated that he would know in the next few weeks whether the Party Q
Acquisition was moving forward. Mr. Rogerson indicated that it was Chemtura's preference to begin engaging with Party Q regarding a
potential transaction in the near-term.

        On April 29, 2016, during Chemtura's first quarter 2016 earnings call, Mr. Rogerson indicated to investors that Chemtura "continue[s]
to work hard on finding the next transformational move for Chemtura [...] that is actionable in the near-term," reiterating that Chemtura
was seeking options for acquisitions, a sale or a merger. Mr. Rogerson further indicated that Chemtura was closing in on such a
transaction, saying "the ability to get [a strategic transaction] done is higher than a lot of the [strategic transactions] we have evaluated last
year."

        On May 5, 2016, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled in person meeting where all of the directors were present, along with
members of Chemtura's senior management. At the invitation of

the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also in attendance. Matthew Sokol, Director, Investor Relations and Corporate
Development, updated the Chemtura board on the status of recent discussions with Lanxess and Parties G and H, the latter two of which
were engaged in due diligence. Mr. Rogerson updated the Chemtura board regarding recent discussions with Party Q, including that
Party Q potentially intended to delay full engagement on the merger of equals transaction to pursue the Party Q Acquisition.

        On May 10, 2016, members of the Chemtura and Party Q deal teams met in person to discuss overall project status, deal timing, due
diligence and synergies. The parties also discussed a number of key deal terms. At this meeting, Party Q indicated definitively that it
wished to pursue the Party Q Acquisition prior to engaging with Chemtura regarding the merger of equals transaction and indicated that,
while it wished to continue discussions with Chemtura in parallel, Party Q would not be in a position to dedicate significant time and
resources on the merger of equals transaction until after it had negotiated the Party Q Acquisition. However, Party Q did indicate that it
believed that Party Q and Chemtura could make significant progress on the key terms of a potential merger of equals transaction and
would provide Chemtura with a term sheet reflecting Party Q's views on certain key terms. Over the next few weeks, Chemtura, Party Q
and their respective advisors negotiated the term sheet, once received, but failed to reach agreement on certain key terms, including certain
terms related to valuation, corporate governance and executive leadership structures of the combined company.

        On May 23, 2016, a representative of Parties G and H reached out to Mr. Rogerson to indicate that Parties G and H would not be in a
position to present an offer for Chemtura because Parties G and H did not expect to be able to offer a premium to the trading price of
Chemtura common stock that would be considered attractive to Chemtura.

        On May 23, 2016, Mr. Rogerson and Matthias Zachert, Chief Executive Officer of Lanxess, spoke by telephone to discuss the status
of discussions and the transaction generally.

        On May 31, 2016, Mr. Rogerson met with Matthias Zachert, Chief Executive Officer of Lanxess in London, England. In that meeting,
Mr. Zachert made a verbal proposal to acquire Chemtura at a price of $32.50 per share (which represented an approximately 22.0%
premium to the closing price of Chemtura common stock on May 31, 2016). Mr. Zachert indicated that Lanxess had engaged
Rothschild GmbH ("Rothschild") as its financial advisor and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP ("Skadden") as its legal advisor
and believed, based on information available to it at the time, it would be in a position to announce a transaction within 4 to 6 weeks.
Mr. Zachert also indicated to Mr. Rogerson that while a deal with Chemtura was attractive to Lanxess, it was not the only deal Lanxess
was considering and that Lanxess was extremely focused on confidentiality, cautioning Chemtura that any leak would cause Lanxess'
proposal to be rescinded.

        In late May 2016, Party O launched an auction process for the business in which Chemtura had expressed interest in participating as
an acquiror. Chemtura entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party O that did not include a "standstill" provision in June 2016 and
received a copy of the confidential information memorandum for the business being divested. Chemtura's management's analysis of the
information revealed that a product line of the business that was not a good fit with Chemtura's existing business was larger than Chemtura
had anticipated. In addition, in light of the ongoing discussions with both Party Q and Lanxess, Chemtura concluded that it did not have
the available resources to conduct in-depth diligence on the Party O business and therefore did not submit a non-binding expression of
interest to Party O.

        On June 3, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting at which all of the directors were present, along with
members of Chemtura's senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk and Morgan Stanley
were also in attendance. Mr. Rogerson updated the Chemtura board regarding the offer presented by Lanxess, as well as the status of
discussions with Parties G and H and Party Q. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed

with the Chemtura board a preliminary financial analysis of Lanxess' proposal, including a comparison of the $32.50 price to the trading
range of Chemtura's common stock, research price targets, comparable companies analysis, comparable transactions, an illustrative
discounted cash flow analysis and an illustrative leveraged buyout analysis. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the
Chemtura board information concerning Morgan Stanley's relationships with, and the beneficial ownership by certain affiliates of Morgan
Stanley of shares of common stock of, Chemtura and Lanxess, which matters are described in the section entitled "—Opinion of
Chemtura's Financial Advisor" below. The Chemtura board concluded that none of these relationships would affect Morgan Stanley's
ability to provide independent advice to the Chemtura board. Davis Polk reviewed with the Chemtura board its fiduciary duties in
connection with the Chemtura board's ongoing consideration of strategic transactions. The Chemtura board, Chemtura's management and
their advisors discussed the offer conveyed by Lanxess and how best to respond. Without reaching any conclusion regarding various
courses of action, including on whether to sell the company, the Chemtura board noted that a transaction with Lanxess had the potential to
be more attractive than a merger-of-equals transaction with Party Q. After discussion, the Chemtura board instructed Mr. Rogerson to
make a counter-proposal to Lanxess in the range of $36-$37 per share. The Chemtura board also determined that management and its
advisors should continue to work on the key term sheet with Party Q regarding the merger-of-equals transaction, but that, in light of the
offer from Lanxess, there was no immediate need to agree to concessions to finalize such terms.

        Next, Mr. Rogerson advised the Chemtura board that, consistent with previous reports to the Board, Chemtura's long range financial
forecasts of its businesses, which were consolidated to prepare the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast had been developed to set
aspirational goals for management to achieve, and that Chemtura had not adjusted those forecasts to reflect the potential risks in achieving
the financial results set forth therein. Mr. Rogerson further noted that as a result, Chemtura's actual financial results had historically been
lower than those contained in its financial forecasts, particularly in the later years of the projected period. Mr. Forsyth agreed and
commented that management has periodically analyzed and reviewed with the Chemtura board Chemtura's actual performance against its
long range forecasts and concluded that after the first year, actual performance against such forecasts falls short by increasingly larger
percentages in the later years. After a discussion of Chemtura's practices with respect to financial forecasts, the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast and the use of such figures in the financial analysis prepared by Morgan Stanley, the Chemtura board instructed
Chemtura's management to begin preparing a long range financial forecast that reflected management's best estimate of the future financial
performance of Chemtura, accounting for risks associated with achieving such financial performance.

        On June 6, 2016, Mr. Rogerson called Mr. Zachert and responded to Lanxess' oral proposal to acquire Chemtura. Mr. Rogerson
indicated that the Chemtura board was open to a transaction with Lanxess and noted that the Chemtura board would expect a price of $37
per share. Mr. Zachert responded that he did not believe that Lanxess would be able to pay $37 per share but was willing to consider a
higher valuation if Lanxess could conduct further due diligence on Chemtura with a focus on valuation and such due diligence yielded a
discovery of additional value.

        Over the next week, Chemtura's management and its advisors worked to assemble additional due diligence materials requested by
Lanxess and to formulate a response to Party Q regarding the open items on the key term sheet for the merger-of-equals transaction.

        On June 13, 2016, Lanxess and its advisors were granted access to a virtual data room developed for the potential transaction.
Chemtura and its advisors also met with Party Q and its advisors regarding the key term sheet for the merger-of-equals transaction. Little
progress with Party Q was made in such meetings.

        On June 17, 2016, Mr. Rogerson and Mr. Zachert spoke by telephone to discuss the status of discussions and the transaction
generally.

        Over the following weeks, Lanxess conducted its due diligence exercise with respect to Chemtura, including by participating in face-
to-face meetings with Chemtura's management for several days in late June and making certain site visits to Chemtura facilities.

        On June 22, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting with all directors in attendance, along with senior members
of Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also in attendance.
Mr. Rogerson updated the Chemtura board as to the status of negotiations with Lanxess. Mr. Sokol provided an update as to the status of
Chemtura's responses to Lanxess' due diligence requests and indicated that Lanxess had communicated to him that Lanxess would be in a
position to provide a revised cash offer after the July 4th holiday. Mr. Rogerson also updated the Chemtura board on the status of
negotiations with Party Q, and the failure to reach resolution on certain open points on the key term sheet related to the merger of equals
transaction, including those related to valuation, corporate governance and executive leadership of the combined company.

        On July 5, 2016, Mr. Zachert responded to Mr. Rogerson regarding Mr. Rogerson's June 6 counter offer. Mr. Zachert indicated that
Lanxess was not in a position to increase its offer of $32.50 per share. Mr. Zachert explained that in the course of Lanxess' due diligence a
number of issues had been identified that had caused Lanxess to question its ability to pay even the $32.50 per share that had initially been
offered. These issues included higher than expected environmental costs associated with remediation and site closures, higher than
expected change of control costs related to Chemtura's employees. Later that day, Chemtura terminated the access of Lanxess and its
advisors to the online dataroom.

        On July 6, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting with all directors in attendance, along with members of senior
Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also in attendance. Mr. Rogerson
briefed the Chemtura board regarding the developments with respect to discussions with Lanxess, including Lanxess' failure to increase its
offer price for Chemtura and the issues Lanxess identified during its due diligence. Mr. Forsyth led a discussion and answered questions
regarding Lanxess' diligence findings. He indicated that Lanxess was in the process of preparing a more detailed explanation of its due
diligence findings and proposed that Chemtura's management review that explanation and respond in kind. The Chemtura board discussed
these developments and compared a potential transaction with Lanxess to a merger-of-equals transaction with Party Q as well as remaining
a stand-alone company. Ultimately, the Chemtura board directed Chemtura's management to continue its discussions with both Lanxess
and Party Q. Next, Mr. Forsyth reviewed a set of long range financial forecasts for Chemtura for 2016-2019, which were distributed prior
to the meeting and, as requested by the Chemtura board, reflected management's best estimate of the future performance of Chemtura in
light of the risks associated with the operation of its business (the "Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast"). The Chemtura board discussed
and asked questions about the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and requested that management provide it with additional detail
regarding the methodology utilized to prepare the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast for review at the next in-person board meeting.

        On July 11, 2016, Chemtura's management received a report from Lanxess outlining its due diligence findings.

        On July 14, 2016, the Chemtura board held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting with all directors in attendance, along with
members of senior Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk
were also in attendance. Mr. Forsyth updated the Chemtura board on the status of conversations with Lanxess regarding Lanxess' due
diligence findings. Next, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an overview of the

status of negotiations with Lanxess and Party Q to date and included an updated financial analysis of the $32.50 per share offer price.
Davis Polk also gave a presentation on deal protections and other key terms in definitive documentation associated with transactions
involving publicly traded companies. The Chemtura board discussed the potential transactions with Party Q and Lanxess with
management and its advisors and concluded that Chemtura's management should continue to seek a higher price for the company from
Lanxess, including by evaluating and responding to Lanxess' due diligence findings.

        On July 15, 2016, Chemtura's management delivered a response to Party Q regarding the open items on the key term sheet related to
the merger of equals transaction with Party Q. Subsequently, Chemtura, Party Q and their respective advisors held several follow up
conversations regarding the term sheet and settled a variety of key issues, including those related to the basis of respective valuations upon
which exchange ratios would be determined. Other matters, including issues related to corporate governance and executive leadership,
were tabled until August when it was expected that the Party Q Acquisition would be announced.

        On July 19, 2016, Chemtura's management and Lanxess' management engaged in a follow up discussion regarding Lanxess' due
diligence findings.

        On July 21, 2016, Mr. Zachert indicated to Mr. Rogerson that Lanxess was still supportive of a transaction at $32.50 per share.

        On July 22, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting with all directors in attendance, along with members of
senior Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also in attendance.
Chemtura's management briefed the Chemtura board on the status of discussions with Lanxess and Party Q. Mr. Rogerson led a discussion
regarding Lanxess' $32.50 per share cash offer and the relative risks, benefits and values of a transaction with Lanxess as opposed to a
transaction with Party Q and continuing to operate Chemtura on a standalone basis absent a transaction with Lanxess or Party Q. After this
discussion, the Chemtura board directed management to continue discussions with Party Q, advise Lanxess that the Chemtura board was
not supportive of a transaction at $32.50 per share and propose that Lanxess make a counter-proposal in a manner designed to obtain the
highest price achievable.

        On July 27, 2016, Mr. Rogerson communicated to Mr. Zachert that the Chemtura board was not supportive of pursuing a transaction
at the $32.50 per share price.

        On July 28, 2016, Rothschild communicated to Morgan Stanley that the $32.50 per share offer price represented the "edge" of what
Lanxess was willing to pay, and that if Lanxess did increase its offer, the increase would be by "quarters and not dollars." Morgan Stanley
responded that mere "window dressing" would not be sufficient and highlighted areas of value not reflected in the $32.50 price.

        On July 29, 2016, during Chemtura's second quarter 2016 earnings call, Mr. Rogerson reiterated to investors that Chemtura
"continued to work hard on finding the next transformational step for Chemtura." He added that Chemtura is "very active in this work and
believes in our ability to execute on a transaction that will deliver shareholder value [...] in the near term," emphasizing that Chemtura was
seeking options for acquisitions, a sale or a merger and that Chemtura was "further along than we've ever been."

        On August 2, 2016, following a conference call with the stockholder representatives of the Lanxess supervisory board, Mr. Zachert
conveyed a revised oral acquisition proposal to Mr. Rogerson of $33.50 per share, which proposal he indicated was Lanxess' "best and
final offer." The $33.50 per share price represented a 20% premium to the price of Chemtura common stock at the close of trading on
August 2, 2016. Mr. Zachert indicated that the offer was subject to two conditions: permitting Lanxess to make additional site visits to
Chemtura facilities and obtaining an acknowledgment from the purchaser of Chemtura's former Antioxidants business, SK Blue
Holdings, Ltd, and its affiliate,

Addivant USA Holdings Corp (collectively, "Addivant") that a non-competition obligation owed by Chemtura to Addivant, that could be
interpreted to apply to Lanxess' existing operations after the closing of an acquisition transaction (the "Addivant Non-Compete") would
not apply to Lanxess' existing operations after closing of the transaction. Mr. Zachert requested that Chemtura resolve the issue related to
the Addivant Non-Compete prior to execution of a definitive merger agreement with Lanxess and further informed Mr. Rogerson that
Chemtura could not identify Lanxess by name to Addivant without Lanxess' prior consent.

        On August 8, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special in person meeting with all directors in attendance, along with members of
senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk were in attendance.
Mr. Forsyth began the meeting with a discussion of certain additional information about the methodology used to prepare the Risk
Adjusted Long Range Forecast that was requested by the Chemtura board at their July 6, 2016 meeting. After asking questions about and
discussing the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast, the Chemtura board directed Morgan Stanley to use the Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast in future valuation analyses.

        Next, Mr. Rogerson briefed the Chemtura board regarding Lanxess' increased offer, as well as the condition related to the Addivant
Non-Compete. Representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered an updated financial analysis of the $33.50 offer price, which employed
various methodologies to evaluate the $33.50 offer price, including each of the methodologies described under "—Opinion of Morgan
Stanley." The Chemtura board discussed the revised offer and asked questions, ultimately concluding that Chemtura should continue to
pursue a transaction with Lanxess at the proposed $33.50 price. However, the Chemtura board instructed management that in light of the
$33.50 offer price, Chemtura should insist on provisions in the merger agreement that provided Chemtura meaningful closing certainty and
a comparatively low termination fee associated with accepting a superior acquisition proposal if one were to emerge after signing.

        Next, Mr. Rogerson updated the Chemtura board regarding recent developments with respect to Party Q, including the announcement
of the Party Q Acquisition, which had happened subsequent to the last meeting of the Chemtura board, and the remaining open key terms
of the merger of equals acquisition. After a discussion, the Chemtura board directed management to prioritize negotiating a transaction
with Lanxess but to continue to negotiate a transaction with Party Q.

        On August 9, 2016, Mr. Rogerson spoke with Mr. Zachert and communicated the Chemtura board's willingness to pursue a possible
transaction at the proposed $33.50 per share offer price, as well as the Chemtura board's focus on closing certainty and a comparatively
low termination fee.

        Also on August 9, 2016 by telephone and by way of a follow-up letter delivered on August 14, 2016, a representative of Chemtura's
management requested that Addivant execute an agreement acknowledging that the Addivant Non-Compete would not apply to an
acquiror of Chemtura.

        On August 10, 2016, Chemtura again permitted Lanxess and its advisors to access the online dataroom.

        On August 11, 2016, research analysts from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. issued a report indicating that new Chinese
environmental regulations had restricted supply of bromine from China causing increases in bromine prices to near record highs.

        On August 12, 2016, Davis Polk sent an initial draft merger agreement to Skadden. The initial draft merger agreement proposed a
regulatory undertaking requiring Lanxess to take all actions and do all things required to cause the transaction to close prior to the outside
date and a termination fee associated with accepting a superior acquisition proposal if one were to emerge after signing of 2.0% of the
transaction's equity value.

        On August 16, 2016, Mr. Forsyth met with representatives of an investment bank with whom Chemtura had a relationship who
indicated that Party I may have an interest in an all-stock acquisition

of Chemtura, because Party I had recently announced a repositioning of its business in a manner that resulted in Chemtura's and Party I's
businesses being a better fit than they were in the Spring of 2015. The representatives of the investment bank indicated that Party I
understood that it would be required to agree to an exchange ratio that reflected a premium to Chemtura's shareholders in connection with
such a transaction and that the next step with respect to a transaction with Party I would be a meeting between Chemtura's management
and Party I management.

        On August 22, 2016, Addivant responded to Chemtura, indicating that at such time it was unwilling to sign an acknowledgment that
the Addivant Non-Compete would not apply to an acquiror of Chemtura.

        On August 23, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting with all directors in attendance, along with members of
senior Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Davis Polk were also in attendance.
Chemtura senior management briefed the Chemtura board on the approach it received regarding a potential transaction with Party I, as
well as the status of negotiations with Party Q and Lanxess. Management also informed the Chemtura board regarding its recent
discussions with Addivant regarding the Addivant Non-Compete. The Chemtura board asked questions and discussed the developments
with respect to the various strategic transactions, as well as the costs, benefits and risks related thereto, as well as the costs, benefits and
risks associated with not undertaking a transaction, and instructed Chemtura's management to explore a transaction with Party I and to
continue to explore transactions with Lanxess and Party Q.

        On August 24, 2016, Chemtura executed a confidentiality agreement with Party I that did not include a "standstill" provision.
Mr. Rogerson also spoke with the Chief Executive Officer of Party I about a potential stock transaction. The parties agreed to meet face-to-
face on August 30, 2016.

        In addition, on the same day, Skadden provided comments on the draft merger agreement sent by Davis Polk earlier in the month.
Skadden's initial markup contained a number of points that Chemtura deemed unacceptable, including (i) removing the proposed
regulatory undertaking in favor of a regulatory covenant that would require Lanxess to only take actions required to consummate the
closing so long as such actions would not have a material adverse effect on the benefits expected to be realized by Lanxess in the
transaction or would not materially affect any of the material assets of Chemtura or Lanxess and (ii) increasing the size of the termination
fee payable with respect to accepting a superior acquisition proposal, if one were to emerge after signing, to 5.0% of the transaction's
equity value.

        Over the week of August 29, 2016, negotiations recommenced with Addivant regarding acknowledgment that the Addivant Non-
Compete would not apply to an acquiror's business after the closing of the merger. In these negotiations, Chemtura suggested certain
accommodations could be extended to Addivant under existing business relationships between Addivant and Chemtura in exchange for
such an acknowledgment. However, no agreement with Addivant was reached as a result of these negotiations.

        On August 30, 2016, senior management of Chemtura and Party I met in person to discuss a potential transaction. During these
meetings, the Chief Executive Officer of Party I indicated that Party I viewed a transaction with Chemtura as a merger of equals and would
expect that the exchange ratio would be set based on market values of the stock of the two companies, without a premium. Chemtura's
management countered that they were in negotiations with respect to another transaction that would deliver premium value to Chemtura
stockholders and that if Chemtura were to enter into any transaction with Party I, Chemtura stockholders would require a premium. After a
short break, Party I indicated that it would be in a position to pay a modest premium, subject to completion of satisfactory due diligence.

        During the month of August 2016, the respective financial advisors of Party Q and Chemtura discussed the scheduling of an in-person
meeting between the CEOs of Party Q and Chemtura, together with other representatives of the companies' respective management teams,
with the purpose of seeking to resolve the outstanding differences between the Chemtura and Party Q on the key term sheet related to the
merger of equals transaction. Chemtura's and Party Q's respective financial advisors agreed that such a meeting would occur in mid-
September 2016.

        On September 2, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special meeting with all directors in attendance, along with members of Chemtura
senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk were also in attendance.
Mr. Rogerson provided the Chemtura board an update with respect to management's discussions with Party I. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley provided a financial analysis of Party I and of an acquisition transaction where the consideration was the stock of Party I. The
Chemtura board asked questions and discussed the potential transaction with Party I, comparing it to a transaction with Lanxess. Next,
Mr. Rogerson updated the Chemtura board on the status of negotiations with Lanxess, including with respect to negotiations related to the
Addivant Non-Compete. Mr. Rogerson indicated that the draft merger agreement most recently received from Lanxess did not reflect
positions on deal certainty or termination fee that were consistent with the expectations previously articulated by the Chemtura board.
After a discussion, the Chemtura board directed management to continue pursuing transactions with each of Lanxess and Party I.

        On September 6, 2016, Davis Polk and Skadden briefly discussed the key open points on the merger agreement. Davis Polk
emphasized that deal certainty and a low termination fee associated with accepting a superior proposal if one were to emerge after signing
were important to the Chemtura board. The following day, Davis Polk delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to Skadden. The
revised merger agreement contained provisions that provided deal certainty to Chemtura, including a revised regulatory efforts
undertaking that would require Lanxess to take all actions required to consummate the closing so long as such actions would not have a
material adverse effect on Chemtura and Lanxess, taken as a whole, and a termination fee associated with accepting a superior acquisition
proposal, if one were to emerge after signing, of 2.0% of Chemtura's equity value.

        On the same day, Mr. Rogerson and the Chief Executive Officer of Party I discussed their meeting the previous week and feedback
received from the Chemtura board. Mr. Rogerson indicated that in the proposed stock deal with Party I, Chemtura would not require any
board seats or governance rights; however, Chemtura stockholders would require Party I's offer to reflect a premium that is competitive
with the other transaction under consideration. The executives agreed to meet for a more extended day of management presentations by the
respective companies' management teams, presentation of additional due diligence questions and review of potential synergies with a
wider team on September 15, 2016. Chemtura instructed its advisors to begin reverse due diligence on Party I based on publicly available
information.

        Also on the same day, at the direction of the Chemtura board, Mr. Rogerson had a discussion with the CEO of Party Q. During that
discussion, Mr. Rogerson advised Party Q's CEO that, due to other developments, he needed to place the discussions between Chemtura
and Party Q on hold and therefore postpone the planned mid-September meeting.

        During the week of September 12, 2016, negotiations between Addivant and Chemtura continued regarding Chemtura procuring an
acknowledgment that the Addivant Non-Compete would not apply to an acquiror's existing business after the closing of the merger. On
September 12, 2016, Addivant made a proposal for certain accommodations that was rejected by Chemtura and Lanxess. Chemtura, with
Lanxess' prior consent, made a counter-proposal to Addivant for an alternative set of accommodations, which on September 16, 2016, was
rejected by Addivant. On September 16, 2016, following discussions between Lanxess and Chemtura, Chemtura made a new proposal for
accommodations to Addivant, which Addivant indicated may be acceptable, subject to further internal confirmation. Legal documentation
associated with such agreement was circulated by Chemtura to Addivant on September 19, 2016.

        On September 13, 2016, Mr. Rogerson and Mr. Zachert spoke by telephone to discuss the status of discussions and the transaction
generally. Mr. Zachert informed Mr. Rogerson that Lanxess' management's authority to enter into a definitive agreement with Chemtura
would expire on

September 30, 2016, after which time Lanxess' management would be required to seek approval of the Lanxess supervisory board to
engage in continued discussions with Chemtura.

        On September 13 and 14, 2016, Davis Polk and Skadden discussed the revised draft merger agreement previously provided by Davis
Polk. While the legal teams were able to resolve a number of the open legal and drafting issues in the merger agreement, the discussions
did not result in mutual agreement on the key issues of deal certainty and the size of the termination fee associated with accepting a
superior proposal if one were to emerge after signing.

        On September 15, 2016, representatives of senior management of each of Chemtura and Party I attended face to face meetings where
each team delivered a management presentation to the other team. The teams also discussed the structure of a proposed transaction and
how Chemtura's operations would fit into a larger repositioning of Party I's business.

        On September 17, 2016, Skadden delivered to Davis Polk comments on the revised draft merger agreement. While the mark-up
resolved certain issues, it did not contain proposals on the key issues of deal certainty or size of the termination fee that would be
acceptable to Chemtura.

        On September 19, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of Party I spoke to Mr. Rogerson. He indicated that while the management
presentations held the previous week went well and that he felt there was a cultural and strategic fit between Party I and Chemtura, Party I
would be unable to make an offer for Chemtura that reflected a value any higher than $28-$29 per share—a price that reflected a premium
of between 2.0% and 5.6% to the then-current trading price of Chemtura common stock of $27.45. Party I explained that its inability to
pay a more significant premium was the result, at least in part, of a recent decline in the market price of Party I's stock.

        Also on September 19, 2016, Morgan Stanley received a call from Party F, inquiring as to whether there was an opportunity for
Party F to partner with a third party to acquire all or a portion of Chemtura. Morgan Stanley responded by indicating that in a partnering
transaction, Chemtura would require premium value be paid to its stockholders. Consistent with prior conversations with Party F, Party F
indicated that it was not in a position to enter into a deal the valuation of which reflected a premium to the then-current market price for
Chemtura stock.

        On September 20, 2016, representatives from Skadden and Davis Polk met telephonically to discuss the merger agreement. While
certain of the open legal and drafting points on the merger agreement were resolved in the course of such discussion, no agreement was
reached on the two key points regarding closing certainty and the size of the termination fee.

        On September 21, 2016, the Chemtura board held a special telephonic meeting with all directors in attendance, along with members
of senior Chemtura's management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk were
also in attendance. Messrs. Rogerson and Forsyth briefed the Chemtura board on the quarter-to-date financial performance of Chemtura,
which in light of near record high bromine pricing and low raw materials costs exceeded last year's financial performance but was slightly
below management's July 2016 estimate. Mr. Rogerson also briefed the Chemtura board on the management team's meetings with Party I
and his subsequent conversations with the Chief Executive Officer of Party I. The Chemtura board asked questions and discussed the
recent developments with respect to Party I. Next, Mr. Rogerson briefed the Chemtura board on the status of negotiations with Lanxess.
Mr. Rogerson noted for the Chemtura board that while an agreement in principle had been reached with Addivant regarding the Addivant
Non-Compete, the draft merger agreement under negotiation with Lanxess continued to contain provisions around closing certainty and
the size of the termination fee that were not consistent with the Chemtura board's previously articulated expectations. The Chemtura board
asked questions and discussed the transaction proposed by Lanxess.

        Next, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided a financial analysis of a potential transaction with Party I, reflecting Party I's
proposed exchange ratio and low premium and comparing the offer made by Party I to Lanxess' "best and final" cash offer of $33.50. The
Chemtura board asked questions and discussed the relative merits and risks of a transaction with Party I and a transaction with Lanxess,
including that because Party I was offering stock consideration, by undertaking a transaction with Party I, Chemtura stockholders would be
positioned to share in transaction synergies and to capture a future control premium if Party I were ever sold. After careful consideration of
the relative costs and benefits of each proposed transaction, the Chemtura board directed management to continue to pursue a transaction
only with Lanxess (as opposed to pursuing a transaction with Party I or with both Lanxess and Party I in parallel) for the reasons set forth
in "—Chemtura's Reasons for the Merger" below, including because the Lanxess transaction presented Chemtura stockholders with the
certainty of a larger amount of consideration and of consideration in the form of cash (as opposed to Party I stock, which could decrease in
value). However, the Chemtura board noted that it had not made a decision to sell the company and that its willingness to consider
approving entry into a definitive merger agreement with Lanxess would be subject to Lanxess' willingness to reach acceptable
compromises on provisions related to closing certainty and size of the termination fee associated with accepting a superior acquisition
proposal if one were to emerge after signing.

        Later in the day on September 21, 2016, representatives of Chemtura's management and their advisors from Morgan Stanley and
Davis Polk met with representatives of Lanxess management and their advisors from Rothschild and Skadden at Davis Polk's offices in
New York City to discuss the open points on the draft merger agreement provided by Skadden on September 17, 2016. The Chemtura team
advised Lanxess that the points in the merger agreement regarding closing certainty and size of the termination fee associated with
accepting a superior acquisition proposal were one to emerge after signing were critically important to the Chemtura board. After a short
break in the meetings, Lanxess proposed a compromise on these key points: Lanxess would be willing to agree to a regulatory covenant
which would require Lanxess to take all actions and do all things necessary to consummate the merger except for actions that would have a
material adverse effect on Lanxess, Chemtura and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole (however, for these purposes Lanxess,
Chemtura and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be deemed to be a company the size of Chemtura and its subsidiaries)
and would be willing to agree to a termination fee associated with accepting a superior proposal that emerges after signing of size equal to
$75 million (approximately 3.5% of Chemtura's equity value). The Chemtura team viewed this proposal as constructive, and after
discussion, agreed to present the proposal to the Chemtura board.

        Later in the day on September 21, 2016, Davis Polk sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Skadden.

        On September 22, 2016, the Chemtura and Lanxess teams again met at Davis Polk's offices along with their respective advisors. As
the teams worked through the remaining open points on the merger agreement, Chemtura received a message from Addivant requesting
additional accommodations from Chemtura in order to enter into any proposed acknowledgment agreement. Neither Chemtura nor
Lanxess desired to provide the additional requested accommodations to Addivant. Lanxess indicated that any change to the proposal made
on September 16, 2016 was unacceptable and suspended negotiations with Chemtura until agreement with Addivant with respect to the
terms of the September 16, 2016 proposal was reached. The team from Chemtura worked with representatives of Addivant that evening to
formulate a proposal that would be acceptable to Chemtura and Lanxess, emphasizing to Addivant that any potential accommodations
were contingent upon Chemtura being able to reach an agreement regarding a potential transaction with Lanxess.

        Chemtura and Addivant reached an agreement late on September 22, 2016, pursuant to which Chemtura would expand the
accommodations granted to Addivant in certain respects, which Chemtura believed would be acceptable to Lanxess, and Addivant agreed
to deliver to Chemtura an

acknowledgment that the Addivant Non-Compete would not apply to Lanxess' existing business after the closing of the merger.

        On September 23, 2016, Chemtura presented this renewed agreement with Addivant to Lanxess, which Lanxess found acceptable.
Over the course of the day, the Chemtura and Lanxess teams again met at Davis Polk's offices along with their respective advisors to
finalize the documentation regarding the arrangements with Addivant and work through the remaining open points on the merger
agreement.

        Over the course of the days on September 23 and September 24, 2016, and early in the day on September 25, 2016, Davis Polk and
Skadden exchanged drafts of the merger agreement, reaching agreement on the remaining open points.

        On September 24, 2016, Chemtura and Addivant agreed to a form of agreement on the Addivant Non-Compete matter and related
accommodations, and placed signatures in escrow with the understanding that the signatures would not be released until the merger
agreement is executed and the identity of the potential buyer of Chemtura is disclosed to Addivant. Also on September 24, 2016,
Chemtura disclosed to Addivant the identity of Lanxess.

        On September 25, 2016, the Chemtura board held an in person special meeting at which all directors were present, along with
members of Chemtura senior management. At the invitation of the Chemtura board, representatives from Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk
were also in attendance. Prior to the meeting, the directors had received copies of the draft merger agreement and a summary of the terms
thereof prepared by Davis Polk, as well as presentation materials and a draft fairness opinion prepared by Morgan Stanley. Representatives
of Davis Polk reviewed with the directors the process of negotiations and the summary of the terms of the merger agreement. The
Chemtura board reviewed, among other things, the following provisions contained in or related to the draft merger agreement: (i) the
obligation of the Chemtura board to recommend the transaction with Lanxess to Chemtura's stockholders and circumstances where the
board may be exempted from such obligations; (ii) "no-shop" restrictions and exceptions thereto (including a "fiduciary out"); (iii) a match
right triggered before the Chemtura board can exercise its right to change its recommendation (and, under certain circumstances, terminate
the merger agreement) in response to a change in circumstances or a superior acquisition proposal; (iv) closing conditions; (v) the parties'
termination rights and circumstances where Chemtura would be obligated to pay a termination fee of approximately 3.5% of Chemtura's
equity value ($75 million) to Lanxess; (vi) certain arrangements relating to employee compensation and benefits; and (vii) the regulatory
efforts standards required of Lanxess. Consistent with previous meetings, the Chemtura board discussed and asked questions about the
draft merger agreement, focusing its inquiry on provisions related to closing certainty and the size of the termination fee, which provisions
the Chemtura board considered acceptable.

        Representatives of Morgan Stanley then reviewed with the Chemtura board their financial analysis of the potential transaction with
Lanxess, including a series of valuation methodologies they had employed with respect to Lanxess' $33.50 per share proposal, including
each of the methodologies described under "—Opinion of Morgan Stanley." The Chemtura board discussed the presentation and asked
questions, reviewing the merits of a potential transaction with Lanxess, as compared to the merits and considerations related to Chemtura's
future performance as a standalone entity, considering, among other things, the near all-time highs for bromine pricing (which the
Chemtura board did not expect to continue indefinitely) and recent low costs of raw materials (which the Chemtura board expected to
increase), as described and discussed at prior meetings. Certain members of the Chemtura board indicated that in their judgment, given
bromine and raw materials pricing, the value of Chemtura stock was currently near its peak. During the course of the Chemtura board
meeting, a representative of Lanxess notified a member of Chemtura's management that the supervisory board of Lanxess had approved
the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement. Morgan Stanley then delivered to the Chemtura board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the $33.50 per share
merger consideration to be received by the holders of Chemtura common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the Chemtura board updated information concerning Morgan Stanley's
relationships with, and the beneficial ownership by certain affiliates of Morgan Stanley of shares of common stock of, Chemtura and
Lanxess, which matters are described in the section entitled "—Opinion of Chemtura's Financial Advisor" below. The Chemtura board
concluded that none of these relationships would affect Morgan Stanley's ability to provide independent advice to the Chemtura board.
Davis Polk then again reviewed with the directors the fiduciary duties applicable to the Chemtura board's consideration of the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Following further discussion, the Chemtura
board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (see the
section entitled "—Chemtura's Reasons for the Merger" below).

        Following the Chemtura board's approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, Chemtura, Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary executed the merger agreement.

        Later that evening, each of Chemtura and Lanxess issued a press release announcing the transaction.

Chemtura's Reasons for the Merger 

        In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Chemtura board consulted regularly with Chemtura's senior management and
Chemtura's outside legal and financial advisors. In the course of (i) making the determination that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Chemtura's stockholders and (ii) reaching the unanimous decision
to approve, adopt and declare advisable the merger agreement and the merger and, subject to Section 6.04 of the merger agreement
(summarized under "—Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement), to
recommend that Chemtura stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement, the Chemtura board considered a variety of factors,
including the following:

• The Chemtura board's review of Chemtura's business, current and projected financial condition, current earnings and
earnings prospects; 

• The Chemtura board's belief that the $33.50 per share merger consideration exceeds Chemtura's likely value as a
standalone company, including its potential for future growth, which belief was based on and informed by consideration of
a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including: 

• The risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Chemtura's performance as a standalone company,
including, among other risks and uncertainties, changes and volatility in the price of raw materials and components
of Chemtura's products, interruptions in supply of raw materials, changes in the market price of Chemtura's
products (including bromine), the comparative lack of scale of Chemtura's business when compared to its
competitors, unfavorable changes in Chemtura's product mix, market-wide reductions in the use of and demand for
bromine products and flame retardant products, weakening of demand in mining and oil and gas application
products and the other risks and uncertainties described in Chemtura's SEC filings;

• The inherent uncertainty of attaining management's internal financial projections, including those set forth under
"—Certain Financial Projections" beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement, including that Chemtura's actual
financial results in future periods could be materially less than the projected results; and 

• The Chemtura board's extensive consideration of other strategic alternatives available to Chemtura for the last
several years, including remaining independent and certain acquisition and merger transactions, based upon, among
other things, the Chemtura board's knowledge of (i) developments in the specialty chemicals industry, including the
industry's current and expected competitive and pricing environment, (ii) Chemtura's business, financial condition
and results of operations, from both an historical and a prospective perspective, and (iii) the risk-adjusted
probabilities associated with achieving Chemtura's long-term strategic plans as a standalone company as compared
to the certainty of value and opportunity afforded to Chemtura stockholders by way of the merger with Lanxess; 

• The fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, providing Chemtura stockholders with certainty of value and
immediate liquidity upon consummation of the merger; 

• Recent and historical market prices for Chemtura common stock, as compared to the merger consideration, including the
fact that the merger consideration of $33.50 per share represents an approximate premium of: 

• 18.9% to the $28.18 closing price per share of Chemtura common stock on September 23, 2016, the last trading day
before public announcement of the merger agreement; 

• 38.1% to the $24.26 low closing price per share of Chemtura common stock for the one year period ended
September 23, 2016; 

• 19.8% to the $27.96 average closing price per share of Chemtura common stock for the 90-trading day period
ended September 23, 2016; 

• 20.8% to the $27.72 average closing price per share of Chemtura common stock for the one year period ended
September 23, 2016; and 

• 22.4% to the $27.36 average intra-day low price per share of Chemtura common stock for the one year period
ended September 23, 2016; 

• The fact that there has been significant volatility in the market price for Chemtura common stock in recent years, with a
two-year high closing price per share of $31.94 on October 30, 2015 and a two-year low closing price per share of $21.79
on January 30, 2015; 

• The fact that, since January 2015, Chemtura and Morgan Stanley and/or Chemtura's management communicated with
approximately 40 potential counterparties to a strategic transaction with Chemtura as part of a robust and public effort to
explore potential strategic alternatives; 

• The fact that Mr. Rogerson had repeatedly publicly indicated that Chemtura was considering all strategic alternatives,
including a sale of the company, in various statements to investors since early 2015 and the Chemtura board identified no
other actionable proposals that provided premium value to Chemtura stockholders; 

• The fact that the Chemtura board negotiated an increase in the merger consideration to $33.50 from Lanxess' initial
proposal of $32.50 on May 31, 2016, as described above under "—Background of the Merger;" 

• The fact that Chemtura did not negotiate exclusively with Lanxess at any time;

• The fact that the only other parties, in addition to Lanxess, to indicate interest in a potential strategic transaction with
Chemtura subsequently determined, after discussions regarding transaction process, structure and consideration and after
performing additional due diligence on Chemtura, to cease pursuing a potential strategic transaction with Chemtura or to
propose a potential strategic transaction with Chemtura at a price that delivered low or no premium value to Chemtura
stockholders; 

• The Chemtura board's belief, based on negotiations with Lanxess and its financial advisor, that Lanxess' August 2, 2016
"best and final" offer of $33.50 per share was the highest per share consideration Lanxess would pay for Chemtura and that
Lanxess might withdraw their offer if Chemtura were to delay entering into a definitive agreement with Lanxess after
Lanxess had made such offer, including due to Lanxess' repeated expressions of concerns about leaks; 

• The opinion of Morgan Stanley that, as of September 25, 2016 and based on the matters considered, the procedures
followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the $33.50 per
share in cash to be received by holders of Chemtura common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair to such
stockholders from a financial point of view, described below under "—Opinion of Chemtura's Financial Advisor;" 

• The Chemtura board's belief that the termination fee and other limitations applicable to alternative acquisition proposals
agreed to in the merger agreement were reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable
potential acquirer from submitting a proposal to acquire Chemtura following the announcement of the merger; 

• The fact that Chemtura's legal and financial advisors were involved throughout the process and negotiations and updated
the Chemtura board directly and regularly, which provided the Chemtura board with additional perspectives on the
negotiations in addition to those of Chemtura's management; 

• The fact that the merger agreement did not include a financing condition and Lanxess indicated it was willing to agree to
representations, warranties and covenants related to its sources of financing for the merger, including the Bridge Loan
Facility, in support of Lanxess' payment and other obligations under the merger agreement; 

• The fact that Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary have committed to use their reasonable best efforts (subject to the limitations
on such efforts described under "The Merger Agreement—Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger" beginning on
page 95 of this proxy statement) to obtain applicable regulatory approvals, which the Chemtura board believed increased
the likelihood that the merger would be completed; 

• The Chemtura board's review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement,
including, among others, the following specific terms of the merger agreement: 

• The limited and otherwise customary conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger; 

• The ability of the Chemtura board, subject to certain conditions, to provide information to and engage in
discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal if the Chemtura board
reasonably believes, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition
proposal constitutes a superior proposal or may lead to a superior proposal and that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties; 

• The ability of the Chemtura board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation that Chemtura
stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and,

in addition, to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with
respect to a superior proposal if the Chemtura board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties;

• The ability of Chemtura to specifically enforce Lanxess' and Merger Subsidiary's obligations under the merger
agreement, including their obligations to consummate the merger; 

• The customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Chemtura in the merger agreement; and 

• The fact that the financial and other terms and conditions of the merger agreement minimize, to the extent
reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to closing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable
flexibility to operate Chemtura's business during the pendency of the merger.

        In the course of its deliberations, the Chemtura board, in consultation with Chemtura's management and Chemtura's outside legal and
financial advisors, also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger, including the following:

• The fact that, subsequent to completion of the merger, Chemtura will no longer exist as an independent public company
and that the nature of the transaction as a cash transaction would prevent Chemtura stockholders from being able to
participate in any value creation that Chemtura could generate, as well as any future appreciation in value of Chemtura; 

• The fact that other potential counterparties to strategic transactions offered stock consideration, which despite reflecting
low or no premium to Chemtura's stock price, would allow Chemtura's stockholders to share in the synergies of such a
transaction and capture a future change of control premium; 

• The covenant in the merger agreement prohibiting Chemtura from soliciting other potential acquisition proposals, and
restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals unless certain conditions are satisfied, although the
Chemtura board believes this would not preclude a potential acquirer from submitting a proposal to acquire Chemtura; 

• The fact that Chemtura would be obligated to pay a termination fee of $75 million under certain circumstances, including
the potential impact of such termination fee on the willingness of other potential acquirers to propose alternative
transactions, although the Chemtura board believed that the termination fee was reasonable and customary and would not
preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquirer from submitting a proposal to acquire Chemtura following the
announcement of the merger; 

• The fact that if the merger is not consummated, Chemtura will be required to pay its own expenses associated with the
merger agreement; 

• The fact that Lanxess' and Merger Subsidiary's obligation to consummate the merger are subject to conditions, and the
possibility that such conditions may not be satisfied, including as a result of events outside of Chemtura's control, and the
fact that, if the merger is not consummated: 

• Chemtura's directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have
experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and Chemtura will have
incurred significant transaction costs attempting to consummate the transaction; 

• The market's perception of Chemtura's continuing business could potentially result in a loss of customers, vendors,
business partners, collaboration partners and employees; and 

• The trading price of the Chemtura common stock could be adversely affected;

• The potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Chemtura's business and relationships with customers,
vendors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees, including the risk that certain key members of
Chemtura's management might choose not to remain employed with Chemtura prior to the completion of the merger,
regardless of whether or not the merger is completed; 

• The fact that Chemtura is obligated to provide Lanxess with notice of any acquisition proposal and with four business days
to match any competing acquisition proposal (and three business days to match any revision to a competing acquisition
proposal), although the Chemtura board believes this would not preclude a potential acquirer from submitting a proposal to
acquire Chemtura; 

• The fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Chemtura has agreed that it will carry on its business in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and, subject to specified exceptions, that Chemtura will not take a number of actions
related to the conduct of its business without Lanxess' prior written consent, and the possibility these terms may limit the
ability of Chemtura to pursue business opportunities that it would otherwise pursue; 

• The fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Chemtura has agreed to assist Lanxess in procuring its financing,
including by preparing certain financial information; 

• The fact that Chemtura's directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in
addition to, those of Chemtura's other stockholders, as described in the section entitled "—Interests of Chemtura's Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 74 of this proxy statement; 

• The fact that Chemtura has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection
with the proposed transaction, regardless of whether the merger is consummated; and 

• The fact that the merger consideration will be taxable to taxpaying stockholders of Chemtura.

        The Chemtura board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, after
considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Chemtura board concluded that the potentially positive
factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger substantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Chemtura board is not exhaustive but is intended to reflect
the material factors considered by the Chemtura board in its consideration of the merger. In view of the complexity, and the large number,
of the factors considered, the Chemtura board, both individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight
to the various factors. Rather, the Chemtura board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered
by it. In addition, individual members of the Chemtura board may have given different weights to different factors.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Chemtura board is forward-looking in nature. This
information should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"
beginning on page 24 of this proxy statement.

Recommendation of the Chemtura Board of Directors 

        After careful consideration, the Chemtura board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Opinion of Chemtura's Financial Advisor 

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

        Chemtura retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with, among other things, the proposed
transaction and to provide a financial opinion. Chemtura selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley's
qualifications, expertise and reputation and Morgan Stanley's knowledge of the business and affairs of Chemtura. Morgan Stanley rendered
to the Chemtura board at its meeting on September 25, 2016, Morgan Stanley's oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, dated September 25, 2016, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its
written opinion, the $33.50 per share merger consideration to be received by the holders of Chemtura common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Chemtura board, dated September 25, 2016, is
attached as Annex B and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. Chemtura's stockholders are urged to, and should, read the opinion
carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to the Chemtura board and addresses only the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Chemtura's stockholders of the $33.50 per share merger consideration to be received by such holders
pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion does not address any other aspect of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to Chemtura's stockholders as to
how to vote at the special meeting held in connection with the merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion set forth in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:

• Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of Chemtura and Lanxess and their financial and legal
advisors; 

• Reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated September 25, 2016, a draft of the bridge loan facility agreement from
certain lenders dated September 24, 2016, and certain related documents; and 

• Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley
deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness
of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by Chemtura, and formed a substantial basis for
its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgment of the management of Chemtura of the future financial performance of Chemtura. In
addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement
without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Lanxess would obtain financing in
accordance with the terms set forth in the bridge loan facility agreement, and that the final merger agreement did not differ in any material
respect from the last draft of the merger agreement which was reviewed by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the merger, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to
be derived in the merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied
upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Lanxess and Chemtura and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to
legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of Chemtura's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be
received by Chemtura's stockholders in the transaction. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets
or liabilities of Chemtura, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on
financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it, as of September 25, 2016.
Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley's opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did
not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses (except where otherwise noted) prepared by Morgan Stanley in
connection with the rendering of Morgan Stanley's oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated
September 25, 2016, to the Chemtura board and reviewed with the Chemtura board on September 25, 2016. The summary set forth below
does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of,
Morgan Stanley, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial

underlying such analyses or factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying such financial analyses
and Morgan Stanley's opinion. Please see Annex B of this proxy statement for the full text of the opinion of Morgan Stanley.

        As described below under "The Merger—Certain Financial Projections" and "The Merger—Background of the Merger," Chemtura
developed and provided certain management forecasts to Morgan Stanley in connection with its analysis of the merger, including the Risk
Adjusted Long Range Forecast. Chemtura's management directed Morgan Stanley to utilize the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast in
connection with its presentation made to the Chemtura board at its meeting on September 25, 2016. In addition, Morgan Stanley
constructed an estimate of consensus forecasts (the "Street Case") based on KeyBanc, SunTrust, Gabelli, Baird, Longbow and Seaport
Global research for 2016-2018 (estimated) and extrapolated 2019 (estimated) per 2018 estimated sales growth rate and margin. Morgan
Stanley referred to the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Street Case in connection with its presentation made to the Chemtura
board at its meeting on September 25, 2016, at which the Chemtura board approved the merger agreement.

Historical Trading Range Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the historical unaffected trading range of Chemtura common stock for the 52-week period ended
September 23, 2016, which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger. Morgan Stanley noted that, during such
period, the maximum closing price for Chemtura common stock was $32.08 and the minimum closing price for Chemtura common stock
was $24.26, as compared to the $33.50 per share merger consideration.

Research Price Targets

        Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available equity research analysts' share price targets as of September 23, 2016, which was the last
trading day prior to announcement of the merger, on an undiscounted basis for Chemtura common stock. Morgan Stanley noted that the
price targets issued by those research analysts with publicly available price targets ranged from $32.00 to $37.00 per Chemtura share, as
compared to the $33.50 per share merger consideration, but when discounted at Chemtura's 9.9% cost of equity, implied a range of $29.25
to $33.75, rounded to the nearest $0.25, per Chemtura share.

        The public market trading price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading
prices for Chemtura common shares and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of
Chemtura and future financial market conditions.

Selected Comparable Trading Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed certain financial information, valuation multiples and market trading data relating to Chemtura and selected
publicly traded companies that Morgan Stanley believed, based on its experience with companies in the specialty chemicals industry, to be
similar to Chemtura's current operations for purposes of this analysis. Financial data of the selected companies were based on McGraw
Hill Financial Inc.'s S&P Capital IQ financial information and analysis, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial
data of Chemtura was based on the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Street Case, as appropriate. "AV" refers to aggregate
enterprise value, calculated as equity value, plus book value of total debt, plus non-controlling interest (as appropriate for the company
being analyzed), less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. "EBITDA" as used herein refers to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, adjusted to exclude nonrecurring and other similar items and one-time
charges. "Pension Adjusted AV" refers to aggregate enterprise value, calculated as equity value, plus book value of total

debt, including underfunded pension and other post-employment benefits ("OPEB") liability, plus non-controlling interest (as appropriate
for the company being analyzed), less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. "Pension Adjusted EBITDA" as used herein refers
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, adjusted to exclude nonrecurring and other
similar items and one-time charges, as well as pension expense (income). Certain of the foregoing terms are used throughout this summary
of financial analyses.

        Morgan Stanley reviewed data, including Pension Adjusted AV as a multiple of estimated calendar years 2016 and 2017 Pension
Adjusted EBITDA, of Chemtura and each of the following selected publicly traded companies in the chemicals industry (the "Chemtura
comparable companies"), the operations of which Morgan Stanley deemed similar for purposes of this analysis, based on its professional
judgment and experience, to Chemtura, labeling such companies as IEP Peers, IPP Peers or WholeCo Peers:

• Albemarle Corporation (IEP Peer) 

• Israel Chemicals Ltd. (IEP Peer) 

• NewMarket Corporation (IPP Peer) 

• Innospec Inc. (IPP Peer) 

• Quaker Chemical Corporation (IPP Peer) 

• Fuchs Petrolub SE (IPP Peer) 

• Cabot Corporation (WholeCo Peer) 

• PolyOne Corporation (WholeCo Peer) 

• Ashland Inc. (WholeCo Peer) 

• Innophos Holdings Inc. (WholeCo Peer)

        With respect to the Chemtura comparable companies, the information Morgan Stanley presented to the Chemtura board included
multiples of Pension Adjusted AV to Pension Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 and 2017 (which we refer to as Pension Adjusted AV / 2016E
Pension Adjusted EBITDA and Pension Adjusted AV / 2017E Pension Adjusted EBITDA, respectively):

        Based on this analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley derived the reference ranges of financial multiples set forth in
the table below and applied these ranges to estimated Pension Adjusted EBITDA for Chemtura for calendar years 2016 and 2017
contained in the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and in the Street Case. For calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, estimated
Pension Adjusted EBITDA for Chemtura was $283 million, $304 million, $315 million and $329 million, respectively, in the Street Case
and $288 million, $323 million, $345 million and $370 million, respectively, in the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast. Based on the
number of outstanding Chemtura common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Chemtura's net debt, the analysis indicated the following
implied per share reference ranges for Chemtura common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, in each case as compared to the $33.50 per
share merger consideration:

        No company utilized in the selected comparable trading analysis is identical to Chemtura. In evaluating comparable companies,
Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Chemtura's and Morgan Stanley's control. These include, among other things,
comparable company growth, profitability and customer concentration, the impact of

competition on Chemtura's businesses and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in
Chemtura's financial condition and prospects or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as
determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis

        In connection with the delivery of Morgan Stanley's fairness opinion, Morgan Stanley also performed a discounted equity value
analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical estimate of future implied value of a company's common equity as a
function of such company's estimated future earnings and a theoretical range of trading multiples. The resulting estimated future implied
value is subsequently discounted back to the present day at the company's cost of equity in order to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the
present value for the company's theoretical future implied stock price.

        For this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a theoretical future value range of implied share prices for Chemtura as of December 31,
2016, and December 31, 2017, and subsequently discounted such theoretical future value range to arrive at an illustrative present value
range of implied share prices for Chemtura as of September 23, 2016. To calculate the theoretical future implied aggregate value range,
Morgan Stanley applied Chemtura's next twelve month ("NTM") Pension Adjusted EBITDA multiple to the NTM Pension Adjusted
EBITDA as of 2016 and 2017 year end, respectively. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the theoretical future implied aggregate value range by
Chemtura's total debt (including underfunded pension and OPEB liability), non-controlling interest and cash and cash equivalents based on
the estimated consolidated balance sheet of Chemtura as of December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2017, respectively, as reflected in the
Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast. To calculate the present value range as of September 23, 2016, Morgan Stanley applied a cost of
equity of 9.9%, estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model ("CAPM") method and utilizing a 6% market risk premium, a risk free
rate of 1.6% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of September 23, 2016, and a 1.37 predicted beta per Barra.

        Based on the foregoing analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following range of implied equity values, rounded to the nearest $0.25,
per Chemtura share as of September 23, 2016, based on estimated future cash flows contained in the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast
and Street Case, in each case as compared to the $33.50 per share merger consideration:

        Morgan Stanley observed the discounted equity analysis was an illustrative analysis only and not a prediction of future trading.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly
available financial terms of selected transactions that involve companies in the chemicals sector. Selected comparable transactions were
selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and knowledge of the sector.

Selected Chemicals Company Precedent Transactions 

        Based on the precedent transaction premia range of 9% - 42%, the analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for
Chemtura common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $30.75 - $40.00.

        No company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Chemtura; nor are the
transactions identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions described above, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
the control of Chemtura, such as the impact of competition on the business of Chemtura or the industry generally, industry growth and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition or property of Chemtura or the industry or in the financial markets in
general. Accordingly, mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable transaction data.

Hypothetical Leveraged Buyout Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the prices at which a financial sponsor might effect
a leveraged buyout of Chemtura. Morgan Stanley based its analysis on the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and extrapolated estimates
for 2020 and beyond from 2019 estimated sales growth rate and margins. Morgan Stanley assumed a transaction date of December 31,
2016, and a five-year investment period ending in December of 2021. Morgan Stanley also made certain other assumptions, including (i) a
multiple of 4.75x of total debt to Chemtura's December 31, 2016, estimated last twelve months ("LTM") EBITDA based on Risk Adjusted
Long Range Forecast and Street Cases, as appropriate, which debt financing consisted of a term loan representing 3.50x Chemtura's
December 31, 2016 LTM EBITDA based on Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and Street Cases, as appropriate, and senior notes
representing 1.25x Chemtura's December 31, 2016 LTM EBITDA based on Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and Street Cases, as
appropriate, (ii) debt financing and transaction expenses based on prevailing market terms at the time of the analysis (including (x) an
interest rate on the term loan of LIBOR plus 4.50% and a 1.00% original issue discount and (y) an interest rate on the senior notes of
8.75%), (iii) a range from 7.5x to 8.5x of aggregate value to December 31, 2021, NTM EBITDA exit multiples, and (iv) a target range of
annualized internal rates of return for the financial sponsor of 17.5% to 22.5%. Morgan Stanley selected the leverage multiple, financing
terms, exit multiple, target internal rate of return, and transaction expenses based upon the application of its professional judgment and
experience.

        The following table summarizes Morgan Stanley's analysis, rounded to the nearest $0.25:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value per share for
Chemtura common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free
cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by
calculating their present value. The "unlevered free cash flows" or "free cash flows" refer to a calculation of the future cash flows of an
asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, stock-based compensation
is treated as a cash expense.

        Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Chemtura using information contained in the Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast and Street Case, as appropriate, and public filings to calculate ranges of the implied value of Chemtura assuming the
merger closes on December 31, 2016. Morgan Stanley defined unlevered free cash flows as Pension Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation
and amortization, less stock based compensation, less taxes (impact of net operating losses not included), plus depreciation and
amortization, less capital expenditures, and less increases in net working capital (in each case based on the Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast and Street Case, as appropriate, and guidance on balance sheet data provided by Chemtura's management to Morgan Stanley).

        Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied values per Chemtura share based on the estimated future cash flows contained in the
Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and Street Case, as appropriate, during the calendar years 2016 through 2019. Using the definition of
unlevered free cash flows set forth above, Morgan Stanley then calculated a terminal value for Chemtura as of December 31, 2019, by
applying a range of perpetual growth rates from 1.0% to 2.0%, derived based on Morgan Stanley's experience and professional judgment.
To calculate an implied pension adjusted aggregate value for Chemtura, the unlevered free cash flows and the terminal value were
discounted to December 31, 2016, using a range of discount rates from 7.7% to 9.3%, which was calculated based on the following
components: (i) a 9.9% cost of equity, estimated using the CAPM method and utilizing a 6% market risk premium, a risk free rate of 1.6%
based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of September 23, 2016 and a 1.37 predicted beta per Barra, (ii) a 3.4% post-tax cost of debt,
which was calculated using the yield to maturity on Chemtura's Senior Notes due 2021 as of September 23, 2016, and tax-effected at 28%
per Chemtura management's guidance and (iii) a debt to total capitalization of 21%, which utilized the current capital structure of
Chemtura as provided by Chemtura's management to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the total implied aggregate value
ranges by Chemtura's total debt (including underfunded pension and OPEB liability), non-controlling interest and cash and cash
equivalents based on the consolidated balance sheet of Chemtura and divided the resulting implied total equity value ranges by Chemtura's
fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the treasury stock method), all as provided by Chemtura's management. Calculated at the
midpoint of the range of perpetual growth rates (1.50%) and discount rates (8.50%) utilized by Morgan Stanley, the terminal value for
Chemtura as of December 31, 2019 was $2,414 million based on the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and $2,140 million based on the
Street Case.

        Based on the foregoing analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following range of implied equity values, rounded to the nearest $0.25,
per Chemtura share as of December 31, 2016, in each case as compared to the $33.50 per share merger consideration:

General

        The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Morgan Stanley arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses
undertaken and assessed as a whole, and it did not ascribe a specific range of values to Chemtura common stock or draw, in isolation,
conclusions from or with regard to, and did not attribute any particular weight to, any one factor or method of analysis, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed
and considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, the summary set forth above does
not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of,
Morgan Stanley, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial
analyses by Morgan Stanley. The analyses listed in the tables and described above must be considered as a whole; considering any portion
of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of the process underlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. In addition, in rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses
and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of implied valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken
to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of Chemtura.

        In performing its financial analyses, Morgan Stanley considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond Morgan Stanley's and Chemtura's
control. The assumptions and estimates contained in the financial analyses and the ranges of implied valuations resulting from any
particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those suggested by such analyses. In addition, financial analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used
in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined by Lanxess and Chemtura, rather than by any financial
advisor, and was approved by the Chemtura board. The decision by Chemtura to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the
Chemtura board. As described above under "The Merger—Chemtura's Reasons for the Merger," Morgan Stanley's analyses were only one
of the many factors considered by the Chemtura board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the
views of the Chemtura board or management with respect to the merger or the $33.50 per share merger consideration.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance
with its customary practice. No limitations were imposed by the Chemtura board upon Morgan Stanley with respect to the investigations
made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion. Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific amount or form of
consideration to Chemtura or that any specific amount or form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
merger.

        The Chemtura board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley
is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial
advisory business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for corporate, estate and other purposes.

        As compensation for its services relating to its engagement, Chemtura has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately
$21 million in the aggregate, excluding reimbursable fees and expenses, approximately $4 million of which was payable upon
announcement of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement while the remainder is contingent upon the consummation of the
merger. Chemtura has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition,
Chemtura has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each
person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under
the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley's
opinion, in addition to the current engagement, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have received aggregate fees of between $12 million and
$13 million for financial advisory and financing services provided to Chemtura. Approximately $12.4 million of these fees were earned in
connection with Morgan Stanley's role in the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions to Platform Specialty Products. In the two years prior to the
date of Morgan Stanley's opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not received any fees for any financial advisory or financing
assignments from Lanxess. In addition, Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof currently is a lender to Chemtura. Morgan Stanley may also
seek to provide financial advisory and/or financing services to Lanxess and/or its affiliates on unrelated matters, subject to the terms of
Morgan Stanley's engagement letter with Chemtura, in the future and expects to receive fees for the rendering of any such services.

        Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth
management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,
commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services.
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or
short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its
customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Chemtura, Lanxess or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be
involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.

Certain Financial Projections 

        Due to, among other reasons, the inherent unpredictability of forward-looking financial forecasts, Chemtura's management does not
generally publish its business plan and strategies nor make external disclosures of its anticipated financial position or results of operations.
However, from time to time, Chemtura's management has provided investors with guidance in its regular earnings press releases and other
investor materials as to profitability or cash flow goals for the current calendar year and

anticipated revenue growth as well as longer term goals for percentage profit margins. However, Chemtura's management does, as part of
ordinary course strategic and operational planning for its business, develop financial forecasts for many purposes, including the setting of
goals for the achievement of revenue and profitability growth that will "stretch" management's performance. As described in "—
Background of the Merger" above, when the Chemtura board first met with Morgan Stanley in 2014 to discuss the review of strategic
alternatives that eventually led to the merger, Chemtura senior management provided to Morgan Stanley for purposes of, and the Chemtura
board directed Morgan Stanley to use, the then most current version of its long range financial forecast for the period 2014 to 2018 for
purposes of certain financial analyses that were presented to the Chemtura board. It is Chemtura's management practice to update such
forecasts annually at the start of each year, although there have been occasions when they have been updated during the course of a year.
Each year Chemtura's businesses develop multi-year financial projections based on their evolving strategies and actions. These business
projections are then consolidated to provide projections for the company as a whole. Each January, Chemtura's management presents these
consolidated projections to the Chemtura board. The first year of each long range forecast when prepared is also the annual budget for the
current calendar year. At the direction of the Chemtura board, Morgan Stanley was provided with each long range financial forecast
following its presentation to the Chemtura board. The long range financial forecast for the period 2015 to 2018 was provided to certain
parties that indicated interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with Chemtura and executed confidentiality agreements with
Chemtura during 2015. In 2016, certain parties who indicated interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with Chemtura and
executed confidentiality agreements with Chemtura, including Lanxess, were provided with the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast.
We refer to Chemtura's management's ordinary course long range financial forecasts for the period of 2016 to 2019 herein as the Pre-Risk
Adjusted Long Range Forecast.

        As described above in "—Background of the Merger." in the course of its review of strategic alternatives for Chemtura, the Chemtura
board determined that it was in the best interest of Chemtura and its stockholders for management to prepare a set of long range financial
forecasts that more accurately reflected management's best estimates of the more likely performance of the business, accounting for the
risks faced by the business (as compared to the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast that reflected certain assumptions made by
management designed to drive improvements in business unit performance and did not reflect such risks). We refer to the adjusted long
range financial forecasts that Chemtura's management prepared in response to this direction, which provides estimates of financial
performance in the period of 2016 to 2019, as the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast. As discussed in "—Background of the Merger"
above, the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast was first presented to the Chemtura board at its telephonic meeting on July 6, 2016, revised
to reflect comments from the Chemtura board regarding the application of the risk adjustments in respect of sales growth and "price over
raws" to revenue estimates for certain of Chemtura's products (as further described below), and was subsequently reviewed by the
Chemtura board at its next scheduled in person meeting on August 8, 2016. Thereafter, the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast was
provided to Lanxess. The Chemtura Board directed Morgan Stanley to rely on the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast for certain financial
analyses underlying its opinion rendered to the Chemtura board on September 25, 2015, as discussed in "—Background of the Merger"
and "—Opinion of Chemtura's Financial Advisor" beginning on pages 33 and 59, respectively, of this proxy statement. The Pre-Risk
Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast included in this proxy statement are presented to give
Chemtura stockholders access to the financial projections that were made available to the Chemtura board, Lanxess and Morgan Stanley.

        Neither the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast nor the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast was prepared with a view toward
public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the American
Institute of Certified Public

Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"). By including the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast in this Proxy
Statement , neither Chemtura nor any of its representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the information
included in such sets of financial projections or the ultimate performance of Chemtura, Laxness or any of their affiliates. Chemtura has
made no representation to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast or the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast.

        The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast included in this proxy statement are
unaudited. Neither Chemtura's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent auditors, have compiled,
examined or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast, nor have they expressed any opinion or given any form of assurance on such
financial forecasts or their achievability. The inclusion of this information in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication
that Chemtura or anyone who received the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast then
considered, or now considers, the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as
such.

        The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast reflect various estimates and assumptions
made by Chemtura, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Chemtura's control. The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast was based on a variety of assumptions that resulted in: (i) a compound annual net sales growth rate of 6.9% through 2019,
(ii) a 20.3% adjusted EBITDA margin in 2019, (iii) annual depreciation and amortization of approximately 5% of net revenue, (iv) an
assumed tax rate of 28% and (v) average capital expenditures of approximately 5.7% of net sales through 2019. The Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast was extrapolated from the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long-Range Forecast by the application of certain risk adjustments to the
period of 2017 to 2019. The projections for the calendar year of 2016 contained in the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast were
replaced with management's most recent forecast of 2016 performance that was prepared in April 2016 in the Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast, as it is Chemtura's management's practice to have its businesses prepare updated forecasts of the performance in the current
calendar year in April, July and October of each year. Based on Chemtura's management's expertise and experience, they determined, and
the Chemtura board agreed, that it was reasonable to risk adjust two key variables in order to more accurately capture the expected future
performance of Chemtura's business: growth in sales from new products, applications and significant customers and the recoverability of
price increases of raw materials (so called "price over raws"). This risk-adjustment methodology for the period of 2017 to 2019 preserved
the linkage between the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long-Range Forecast being implemented by Chemtura's business teams while creating a more-
likely projection of future financial performance of Chemtura's business. These two variables were selected based on a review of the
underlying reasons why Chemtura had not historically achieved the financial results embodied in management's forecasts as reflected in
the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast. Management's risk adjustment with respect to growth in sales reflected the business reality
that Chemtura's estimates of sales of new products, with respect to new applications for products and to new customers were more prone to
shortfalls to target than sales of existing products to existing customers. Management's risk adjustment with respect to "price over raws"
specifically accounted for the business reality that because many of the raw materials that Chemtura purchases are derived from oil,
Chemtura has historically experienced significant volatility in its raw material input costs, which Chemtura was not able to pass on to
customers on a consistent basis, and this volatility was rarely anticipated in Chemtura's projections. These risks and the historical
divergence between the actual performance of Chemtura's business and management's forecast had been reviewed by

Chemtura's management during the preparation of the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the resulting analysis presented to the
Chemtura board.

        Preparation of the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast reflected subjective judgment
in many respects and, therefore, the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast are susceptible
to multiple interpretations attributable to the volatility of Chemtura's industry and based on actual experience and business developments.
As such, the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast constitute forward-looking information
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results, including, but
not limited to, Chemtura's performance and ability to achieve strategic goals over the applicable period, competitive conditions, sales
trends, fluctuations in gross margins, operating expenses, customer demand, industry performance, effective tax rates and economic
conditions and the factors described under "Risk Factors" in Chemtura's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, Chemtura's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2016 and in Chemtura's other filings with the SEC. For additional information on factors that may cause Chemtura's future
financial results to materially vary from those projected below, see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on
page 24 of this proxy statement. Neither the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast nor the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast can,
therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should be relied upon as such.

        The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast were prepared by Chemtura's management
based on information available at the time of preparation and are not a guarantee of future performance. The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less
predictive with each succeeding future year. Because the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast are based on numerous assumptions (including the material assumptions described above) and the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range
Forecast was designed as a tool for setting goals related to revenue and profitability growth (also as described above), Chemtura cautions
investors that future results may be materially different from those forecast. Neither Chemtura nor any of its affiliates intends to, and each
of them disclaims any obligation to, update, revise or correct the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long
Range Forecast if any of them are or become inaccurate (even in the short term), except as required by applicable law.

        The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction
with the historical financial statements and other information regarding Chemtura contained in Chemtura's public filings with the SEC.
The Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast do not take into account any circumstances or
events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the merger. Further, the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk
Adjusted Long Range Forecast do not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated and should not be
viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Chemtura stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Pre-
Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast or the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast included in this proxy statement.

        Certain of the line items in each of the Pre-Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast,
including non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP tax rate and adjusted EBITDA, are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP,
and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Chemtura may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.

(1) Chemtura utilizes non-GAAP financial measures to manage its business, to allocate resources and to make
comparisons of its performance to that of its peers. Reflecting this management practice, Chemtura's businesses
develop projections on the same non-GAAP basis. This summary therefore contains financial measures that are not
calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. Those financial measures are referred to as "Non-GAAP." Non-
GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
presented in compliance with GAAP, and non GAAP financial measures as used by Chemtura may not be
comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. 

(2) "Non-GAAP net sales" means for a period the GAAP net sales less the revenue accretion and amortization of a
below market contract liability related to the supply agreements resulting from the sale of our Chemtura
AgroSolutions business. We exclude these revenues as the accretion and amortization do not generate current or
future cash flows. 

(3) "Adjusted EBITDA" means, for a period, net earnings/(loss) from continuing operations, plus, to the extent included
in the calculation of net earnings for such period in accordance with GAAP, the sum of income tax expense, loss on
early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, other (income)/expense, net, loss/(gain) on sale of assets or
investments, charges/(income) associated with the curtailment or settlement of pension and post-retirement medical
plans as the result of dispositions, mergers or significant plan amendments, expense accruals/(releases) related to
environmental remediation liabilities of manufacturing sites of former business operations no longer operated by
Chemtura, expenses related to natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes that significantly disrupt
operations, the release of cumulative translation losses/(gains) related to the liquidation of a subsidiary, non-cash
stock-based compensation expense, facility closure, severance and related costs, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment expense, expenses associated with acquisitions or divestitures by Chemtura and expenses related to the
Lanxess merger and the integration of Lanxess and Chemtura less the accretion and amortization of a below market
contract liability related to the supply agreements resulting from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. 

(4) "Depreciation and amortization" means depreciation and amortization expense of Chemtura for a period excluding
any accelerated expense arising from an impairment or facility closure. 

(5) "Adjusted operating income" means, for a period, Adjusted EBITDA less Depreciation and amortization expense and
stock based compensation expense.

(1) Chemtura utilizes non-GAAP financial measures to manage its business, to allocate resources and to make
comparisons of its performance to that of its peers. Reflecting this management practice, Chemtura's businesses
develop projections on the same non-GAAP basis. This summary therefore contains financial measures that are not
calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. Those financial measures are referred to as "Non-GAAP." Non-
GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
presented in compliance with GAAP, and non GAAP financial measures as used by Chemtura may not be
comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. 

(2) "Non-GAAP net sales" means for a period the GAAP net sales less the revenue accretion and amortization of a
below market contract liability related to the supply agreements resulting from the sale of our Chemtura
AgroSolutions business. We exclude these revenues as the accretion and amortization do not generate current or
future cash flows. 

(3) "Adjusted EBITDA" means, for a period, net earnings/(loss) from continuing operations, plus, to the extent included
in the calculation of net earnings for such period in accordance with GAAP, the sum of income tax expense, loss on
early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, other (income)/expense, net, loss/(gain) on sale of assets or
investments, charges/(income) associated with the curtailment or settlement of pension and post-retirement medical
plans as the result of dispositions, mergers or significant plan amendments, expense accruals/(releases) related to
environmental remediation liabilities of manufacturing sites of former business operations no longer operated by
Chemtura, expenses related to natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes that significantly disrupt
operations, the release of cumulative translation losses/(gains) related to the liquidation of a subsidiary, non-cash
stock-based compensation expense, facility closure, severance and related costs, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment expense, expenses associated with acquisitions or divestitures by Chemtura and expenses related to the
Lanxess merger and the integration of Lanxess and Chemtura less the accretion and amortization of a below market
contract liability related to the supply agreements resulting from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business.

Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Chemtura board to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
Chemtura's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Chemtura
stockholders generally. The Chemtura board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the
merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and in recommending to our stockholders that the merger
agreement be approved. These interests are described and quantified below.

Equity-Based Awards

        Chemtura's executive officers currently hold vested stock options and unvested restricted stock units and performance shares. Certain
of Chemtura's non-employee directors hold fully vested stock awards that they elected to defer under the Chemtura Amended and Restated
Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan.

74

(4) "Pension Adjusted EBITDA" means, for a period, net earnings/(loss) from continuing operations, plus, to the extent
included in the calculation of net earnings for such period in accordance with GAAP, the sum of income tax expense,
loss on early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, other (income)/expense, net, loss/(gain) on sale of assets or
investments, charges/(income) associated with the curtailment or settlement of pension and post retirement medical
plans as the result of dispositions, mergers or significant plan amendments, expense accruals/(releases) related to
environmental remediation liabilities of manufacturing sites of former business operations no longer operated by
Chemtura, expenses related to natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes that significantly disrupt
operations, the release of cumulative translation losses/(gains) related to the liquidation of a subsidiary, non-cash
stock-based compensation expense, facility closure, severance and related costs, depreciation, amortization and asset
impairment expense, expenses associated with acquisitions or divestitures by Chemtura and expenses related to the
Lanxess merger and the integration of Lanxess and Chemtura less the accretion and amortization of a below market
contract liability related to the supply agreements resulting from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business
less certain adjustments associated with Chemtura's ongoing employee pension liabilities. 

(5) "Depreciation and amortization" means depreciation and amortization expense of Chemtura for a period excluding
any accelerated expense arising from an impairment or facility closure. 

(6) "Adjusted operating income" means, for a period, Adjusted EBITDA less Depreciation and amortization expense and
stock based compensation expense. 

(7) "Non-GAAP tax rate" means, for a period, the tax expense of Chemtura as a percentage of earnings before taxes
having excluded all items of income and expense excluded in the computation of Adjusted operating income, the
effect of the establishment or release of any valuation allowance and any settlements related to the tax audits of prior
periods. 

(8) "Unlevered free cash flow" was calculated by Morgan Stanley at the direction of Chemtura Management for use in
Morgan Stanley's Discounted Cash Flow Analysis and defined to mean Pension Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation
and amortization, less stock based compensation, less taxes (impact of net operating losses not included), plus
depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures and less increases in net working capital (in each case, based
on the Risk Adjusted Long Range Forecast and guidance on balance sheet data provided by Chemtura's management
to Morgan Stanley).

Table of Contents

        On consummation of the merger, the equity-based awards then held by Chemtura's executive officers and non-employee directors
would be treated as follows:

• Each outstanding stock option (all of which are vested), each vested restricted stock unit (including director deferred stock
awards) and each performance share for which the performance period has ended will be canceled in exchange for payment
to the holder of an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration of $33.50 per share, multiplied by the number of
shares of Chemtura common stock underlying the award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of a stock option,
and based on actual performance as of the end of the performance period, in the case of a performance share). 

• Each unvested restricted stock unit, and each performance share for which the performance period has not ended, will be
converted into a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the merger consideration of $33.50 per share (based on target
performance, in the case of a performance share). Each such deferred award will be paid in cash in accordance with the
vesting and payment schedule applicable to the corresponding restricted stock unit or performance share. The vesting and
payment of each such deferred award would accelerate on a "double trigger" basis on termination of employment without
"cause" or resignation for "good reason" following the merger (except that such payment will be delayed to the extent
required to avoid triggering a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code). For the estimated values of this "double
trigger" acceleration, see the "Equity" column of the table under "Golden Parachute Compensation" below.

        No new offering period will commence under the Chemtura 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan after the end of 2016, and the plan
will be terminated effective as of the closing of the merger. The amount credited to each participant's account on the final purchase date
under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which date will be no later than five business days prior to the closing date of the merger)
will be applied to purchase the number of shares of Chemtura common stock determined pursuant to the terms of the plan. At the effective
time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, each such share of Chemtura common stock will
be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Management Incentive Plan

        Each of Chemtura's executive officers participates in the Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP"), an annual performance-based cash
incentive program. Under the merger agreement, Chemtura will pay to each executive officer (and each other participant in the MIP), on or
as soon as practicable after the merger closing date, the pro-rata portion of the amount that the executive would have earned for the year of
Closing under the MIP, based on performance achieved through the closing date, as determined by Chemtura in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. For the estimated amounts of these "single trigger" pro-rated MIP payments, see footnote 1 to the
table under "Golden Parachute Compensation" below.

Supplemental Savings Plan

        The merger agreement provides that Chemtura will make a profit sharing contribution for 2017 to the account of each executive
officer (and each other participant) under Chemtura's Supplemental Savings Plan, in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of the amount
of the profit sharing contribution that would have been made for such participant under such plan for 2017, based on performance
achieved through the merger closing date. Under the terms of the Supplemental Savings Plan, all amounts contributed to participants'
accounts under the plan (all of which are vested from the

trigger" pro-rata profit sharing contributions, see the "Pension/NQDC column" of the table under "Golden Parachute Compensation"
below.

Employment Agreements

        Each of Chemtura's named executive officers (other than Simon Medley, Executive Vice President, Industrial Performance Products
and Great Lakes Solutions) and Alan Swiech (Executive Vice President, Organometallics Specialties and Support Services) has an
employment agreement under which the executive would be entitled to the following payments on termination of employment without
"cause" or resignation for "good reason" within two years after the effective time of the merger:

• A lump sum cash severance payment equal to a specified multiple of the sum of the executive's base salary plus target
bonus (three times for Craig Rogerson (Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer) and two times for each other
executive); 

• A pro-rated bonus payment for the calendar year of termination, based on full-year performance, and paid at the same time
as bonuses are paid to other Chemtura employees; 

• Accelerated vesting of unvested equity-based awards (with performance shares vesting at target); 

• Continued health benefits for a specified period (two years for Mr. Rogerson, 18 months for Stephen Forsyth (Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), and one year for each other executive); and 

• Outplacement services.

        These termination payments are subject to the executive's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of
Chemtura substantially in the form appended to the employment agreement. The payments are subject to reduction to the extent necessary
for the executive to avoid the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, if such reduction would result in the executive retaining
a higher amount of the payments (net of the excise and other taxes) than if such reduction were not made. For estimates of the amounts of
these "double trigger" termination payments, see the "'Double Trigger' Severance" column of footnote 1 and the "Perquisites/Benefits"
column of the table under "Golden Parachute Compensation" below.

        The employment agreements generally define "cause" to mean the executive's:

• Conviction for or entry of, or plea of nolo contendere with respect to, a felony (other than in connection with a traffic
violation); 

• Continued failure to substantially perform his or her material duties; 

• Act of fraud or gross willful material misconduct; or 

• Willful and material breach of the executive's confidentiality agreement or non-competition agreement.

        The employment agreements generally define "good reason" to mean the occurrence of any of the following events without the
executive's consent:

• Any material diminution or adverse change in the executive's titles, duties or authorities;

Table of Contents

• A reduction in the executive's total compensation, including a reduction in the executive's base salary, target bonus or
annual minimum equity award value; 

• A material adverse change in the executive's reporting responsibilities; 

• The assignment of duties substantially inconsistent with the executive's position or status with Chemtura; 

• A relocation of the executive's primary place of employment to a location more than 25 miles further from the executive's
primary residence than the current location of Chemtura's offices; 

• Any other material breach of the employment agreement or any other agreement by Chemtura or its affiliates; 

• The failure of Chemtura to obtain the assumption in writing of its obligations under the employment agreement by any
successor to all or substantially all of the assets of Chemtura after a merger, consolidation, sale or similar transaction in
which such employment agreement is not assumed by operation of law; or 

• Any material diminution in the aggregate value of employee benefits provided to the executive under any employee benefit
plan, other than pursuant to across-the-board reductions to employee benefits applicable to all senior executives.

Executive and Key Employee Severance Plan

        Each of Chemtura's executive officers (other than those with the employment agreements described above) participate in Chemtura's
Executive and Key Employee Severance Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan"), which provides for the following payments on
termination of employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" within two years after the effective time of the merger:

• A lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of the executive's base salary plus target bonus; 

• A pro-rated bonus for the calendar year of termination, based on full-year performance, and paid at the same time as
bonuses are paid to other Chemtura employees; 

• Continued health benefits for one year (or, if earlier, through the date on which the executive becomes eligible for health
benefits from a new employer); and 

• Payment up to $15,000 of reasonable expenses for seeking comparable employment.

        These termination payments are subject to the executive's execution and non-revocation of a separation agreement and general release
in such form as Chemtura, in its sole discretion, determines. The payments are subject to reduction to the extent necessary for the
executive to avoid the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, if such reduction would result in the executive retaining a
higher amount of the payments (net of the excise and other taxes) than if such reduction were not made. For estimates of the amounts of
these "double trigger" termination payments, see the "'Double Trigger' Severance" column of footnote 1 and the "Perquisites/Benefits"
column of the table under "Golden Parachute Compensation" below.

Table of Contents

        The Executive Severance Plan generally defines "cause" to mean the executive's:

• Theft, fraud, embezzlement or intentional disclosure of confidential and/or proprietary information; 

• Conduct or plans to engage in conduct that would be considered a breach of the executive's acknowledgement and
agreement that the executive executed as a condition to plan participation (which includes certain restrictive covenants), or
any other comparable agreement entered into by the executive in favor of Chemtura; 

• Willful disregard for or neglect of the executive's duties or the interests of Chemtura; 

• Conviction of a felony or any criminal offense; 

• Breach of fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty or other breach of trust; 

• Any willful act against the material financial interests of Chemtura; or 

• Willful destruction of Chemtura property.

        The Executive Severance Plan generally defines "good reason" to mean the occurrence of any of the following events without the
executive's consent:

• A change to the executive's status or position as an officer of Chemtura and such change represents a material diminution in
the executive's authority, duties or responsibilities; 

• A material reduction to the executive's base salary and/or target bonus and such reduction results in a material diminution
in the executive's base compensation; or 

• A relocation of the executive's primary place of employment to a location more than 50 miles from the original location
and such relocation is a material change in the geographic location at which the executive must perform services for
Chemtura.

Indemnification

        For six years after the effective time of the merger, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in accordance with the applicable organizational documents of Chemtura
and its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, each present or former director or officer of Chemtura or any of its
subsidiaries against all threatened or pending claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations to which such director or officer is made
a party or with respect to which such director or officer is otherwise involved, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such director or
officer is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request
of Chemtura as such for another enterprise. In addition, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to advance expenses
(subject to certain conditions) as incurred to such director or officer and to cooperate in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

Golden Parachute Compensation

        The table below sets forth for each of Chemtura's five named executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are
based on or otherwise relate to the merger and that will or may become payable to the named executive officer either immediately at the
effective time of the merger (i.e., on a "single trigger" basis) or on a qualifying termination of employment within two years after the
merger (i.e., on a "double trigger" basis). Chemtura's stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, such
compensation for these named executive officers (see the section entitled "Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related
Compensation Arrangements (Proposal 2)" beginning on page 110 of this proxy statement). Because the vote to approve such

Table of Contents

compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Chemtura or Lanxess. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by
Chemtura's stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote to
approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the table and above
under "Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

        The estimates in the table assume that the merger had become effective on September 30, 2016 and that immediately after the
effective time of the merger each executive's employment had been terminated without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason." See
the footnotes to the table for additional assumptions.

        The table also sets forth estimates of the amounts of such compensation for Chemtura's three executive officers other than the named
executive officers. Chemtura's stockholders are not being asked to approve such compensation for these individuals.

        The amounts payable to each executive officer are subject to reduction under the employment agreements (or, for executives without
employment agreements, the Executive Severance Plan) to the extent necessary for the executive to avoid the excise tax imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code, if such reduction would result in the executive retaining a higher amount of the payments (net of the excise and
other taxes) than if such reduction were not made. Any such reduction would be applied first to any cash severance, second to any other
cash amount payable, third to any benefit valued as a "parachute payment" for purposes of the excise tax rules and fourth to the
acceleration of vesting of any equity award.

(2) The amounts in this column represent the "double trigger" accelerated vesting of the deferred cash awards into which the executive officers' unvested
RSUs and performance shares will be converted at the effective time of the merger, as provided under the merger agreement. Because the merger
agreement provides for such "double trigger" vesting, no additional amount is shown for the "double trigger" vesting of equity awards provided under
the employment agreements with the executive officers who have such agreements.

Chemtura will make to the account of each executive officer (and each other participant) under Chemtura's Supplemental Savings Plan, as provided
under the merger agreement.

(5) Mr. Swiech's 2016 MIP Target is based, in part, on the performance of Chemtura's IEP segment. As in the past, the Compensation & Governance
Committee of Chemtura's board of directors may exercise negative discretion and base Mr. Swiech's 2016 MIP payout on the performance of
Chemtura's OMS business which is a business unit within the IEP segment. If the Compensation & Governance Committee were to exercise such
negative discretion and base Mr. Swiech's 2016 MIP payout solely on the performance of the OMS business, the "Single Trigger" Pro-Rata Bonus
payable to Mr. Swiech would have been reduced by $64,000.

the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders committed to provide an unsecured term loan bridge credit facility in an aggregate amount
of up to €2.0 billion to Lanxess AG for the purposes of funding (i) the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Chemtura pursuant

October 10, 2016. In connection with the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of hybrid notes by Lanxess AG in an aggregate principal
amount of €500 million, the commitments under the Credit Agreement were further reduced to €500 million on December 6, 2016. The
remaining commitments under the Credit Agreement automatically terminate on the earliest of (a) the date that the merger is
consummated, (b) December 25, 2017, and (c) the date of termination of the merger agreement prior to the closing of the merger. Lanxess
intends to use the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement along with cash on hand to finance the merger and pay related
expenses.

        The obligation of the Lenders to provide debt financing under the Credit Agreement is subject to a number of conditions. There is a
risk that these conditions will not be satisfied and the debt financing may not be funded when required.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger 

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which prevents Chemtura and Lanxess from completing the merger until
required information and materials are furnished to the DOJ and the FTC and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. On
October 17, 2016, Chemtura and Lanxess filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC,
which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. On November 16, 2016, Lanxess withdrew its notification and re-filed the
requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on November 18, 2016. This triggered the start of a
new HSR Act waiting period, which expired on December 19, 2016. The DOJ, the FTC, state attorneys general and others may challenge
the merger on antitrust grounds either before or after expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting period. Accordingly, at any time
before or after the completion of the merger, any of the DOJ, the FTC, state attorneys general or others could take action under the
antitrust laws, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the
merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.

        Completion of the merger is also conditioned on approval from the European Commission. The merger cannot be completed until a
notification has been filed with the European Commission and the European Commission has adopted, or has been deemed under the
EUMR to have adopted, all decisions and approvals necessary to allow consummation of the merger. The first phase review period under
the EUMR is 25 working days from submission of a complete notification. The notification has not yet been filed with the European
Commission.

        Approval, consent or consultation, as applicable, with respect to the merger in each of Brazil, China, Japan, and South Korea is a
condition to the closing of the merger.

        The merger agreement also provides for Chemtura and Lanxess to file a joint voluntary notice under Section 721 of the DPA. The
DPA provides for national security reviews and, where appropriate, investigations by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States ("CFIUS"), when a foreign company acquires or seeks to acquire control of a U.S. company. The merger cannot be consummated
unless Chemtura and Lanxess receive approval by CFIUS, meaning (1) Chemtura and Lanxess have received written notice from CFIUS
that any review, investigation or other proceeding under the DPA with respect to the merger has concluded without action or
recommendation for

suspension or prohibition; (2) CFIUS has concluded that the merger is not a covered transaction subject to review; or (3) the President of
the United States has not, within 15 calendar days of a CFIUS report to him, announced a decision to take any action to block, suspend,
otherwise prevent or place any limitations on the consummation of the merger. There can be no assurance that CFIUS will conclude its
review, investigation or other proceeding without imposing significant conditions or that CFIUS will not recommend that the President of
the United States block the merger.

        Chemtura is registered with the DDTC as a manufacturer and exporter of "defense articles," as that term is defined under ITAR. ITAR
requires that a registrant notify DDTC at least 60 days prior to the consummation of any transaction that would result in "the sale or
transfer to a foreign person of ownership or control" of a registrant. The merger cannot be completed unless and until (1) 60 days have
passed since Chemtura notified the DDTC of the merger and the DDTC has not taken or threatened to take enforcement action against
Lanxess in connection with the consummation of the Merger or (2) the DDTC has notified Chemtura or Lanxess that it does not intend to
take enforcement action against Lanxess in connection with the consummation of the merger. Chemtura submitted the notice of the merger
to the DDTC on November 10, 2016.

        One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the
necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn
regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is
currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will
ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by Chemtura stockholders and the completion
of the merger.

        Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory
clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will
not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require
changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.
For more information about regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The exchange of Chemtura common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and may also be taxable under state and local and other tax laws. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled "Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement) whose shares of Chemtura common stock
are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax
basis in such shares.

        You should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 82 of this
proxy statement and consult your tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to you in your particular
circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Delisting and Deregistration of Chemtura Common Stock 

        Upon completion of the merger, the Chemtura common stock currently listed on the NYSE and Euronext Paris will cease to be listed
on the NYSE and Euronext Paris and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Litigation Related to the Merger 

        In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on or around November 16, 2016, a purported stockholder
of Chemtura filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against
Chemtura, the members of the Chemtura Board, Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary, captioned Scarantino v. Chemtura Corporation, et al.,
16 Civ. 6051-ER. The Action asserts a claim against Chemtura and the members of the Chemtura Board pursuant to Section 14(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and a claim against the members of the Chemtura Board and Lanxess pursuant to Section 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint generally alleges that the preliminary proxy statement omitted certain material
information regarding the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and also alleges that the merger consideration is unfair,
certain terms of the merger agreement are unfair, and the individual defendants are financially interested in the merger. The Action seeks,
among other remedies, to enjoin the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or in the event that an injunction is not awarded,
rescission of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and unspecified money damages, costs and attorney's fees. Chemtura
believes that the Action is without merit and intends to defend vigorously against all claims asserted.

Appraisal Rights (page 83 and Annex C) 

        Under Delaware law, holders of our common stock who do not vote in favor of approving and adopting the merger agreement will
have the right to seek appraisal of and receive the fair value of their shares of our common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery if the merger is completed, but only if they comply with all requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, as in effect on
September 25, 2016, the date of the parties' entry into the merger agreement, the text of which section can be found in Annex C to this
proxy statement and the requirements of which section are summarized in this proxy statement. This appraisal amount could be more than,
the same as or less than the merger consideration. Any holder of our common stock intending to exercise appraisal rights, among other
things, must submit a written demand for an appraisal to us prior to the vote on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, must
not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and must hold his, her or its shares of Chemtura
common stock of record when submitting a written demand for appraisal and continue to hold the shares through the effective time of the
merger. If a stockholder votes (or submits a proxy to vote that is not revoked before the taking of the vote on the merger agreement at the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof) for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, such stockholder will waive
his, her or its rights to seek appraisal of his, her or its shares of Chemtura common stock under Delaware law. Also, merely voting against
or abstaining (in person or by proxy) with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will not protect a stockholder's rights to
an appraisal. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Delaware law will result in the loss of your ability to seek and
obtain appraisal rights. Holders of our common stock who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights, due to the complexity of the appraisal process. Additionally, holders of our
common stock that hold shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record and wish to exercise appraisal rights should consult with
the record holder of your shares to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such record holder.

proxy statement as Annex A, and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

        The following summary of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 25, 2016, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Annex A to this proxy statement, is intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to
modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Chemtura in its public reports filed with the SEC. The merger agreement contains
representations and warranties by Chemtura, Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary which were made only for purposes of that agreement and
as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement (and have been disclosed and summarized herein to provide disclosure to Chemtura stockholders
regarding the terms and conditions of the merger and the allocation of rights and responsibilities among the parties related to the merger);
may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by the disclosure schedules to the merger
agreement (any qualification contained in such disclosure schedules that is material has been disclosed herein or if such a qualification
becomes material after the date hereof, will be disclosed in a supplement to this proxy statement); were made for the purposes of
allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may apply
contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger
agreement, which subsequent information may not be fully reflected in Chemtura's public disclosures if such updates are not required by
law or are not nececessary to provide Chemtura's stockholders with a materially complete understanding of the Merger Agreement and
transactions contemplated thereby.

        Additional information about Chemtura may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Chemtura's other public filings. See
"Where You Can Find More Information," beginning on page 117 of this proxy statement.

Structure of the Merger 

        At the effective time of the merger, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Chemtura. Chemtura will be the surviving
corporation in the merger and will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
Lanxess. The certificate of incorporation of Chemtura as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be amended by
virtue of the merger at the effective time of the merger to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary as in effect
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that the name of the surviving corporation will be "Chemtura Corporation;"
the provisions relating to the incorporator of Merger Subsidiary will be omitted and the indemnification provisions relating to officers and
directors will be no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in Chemtura's current charter as of
September 25, 2016. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary as in effect at the effective time of the merger will be the bylaws of the surviving
corporation. The directors of Merger Subsidiary at the effective time of the merger will be the directors of the surviving corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Chemtura at the effective time
of the merger will be the officers of the surviving corporation.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Chemtura and Lanxess, the closing of the merger will take place no later than the fifth business
day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth

in the merger agreement and described in the section entitled "—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 100 of this
proxy statement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions) at the closing of the merger.

        The merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such
later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger by mid-
2017. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, which
are described below, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Chemtura or Lanxess could delay the completion of the merger, or
prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the
merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.

Effect of the Merger on Chemtura's Stock 

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of Chemtura common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger (other than shares owned by Chemtura, Lanxess or any of their respective subsidiaries or any stockholder who has properly
demanded and not validly withdrawn rights of appraisal in accordance with Delaware law, together, the "excluded shares") will be
converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. At the effective time of the
merger, all of the shares of Chemtura common stock (other than the excluded shares) will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and
will cease to exist, and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $33.50 for each such share,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of Chemtura common stock held by Chemtura, Lanxess or any of their respective
subsidiaries will cease to be outstanding and will be canceled without payment of any consideration. In addition, each share of Chemtura
common stock the holder of which has properly demanded rights of appraisal in accordance with Delaware law will not be canceled and
converted into the right to receive merger consideration unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its
right to appraisal. If any holder of Chemtura common stock that demands appraisal rights properly perfects such rights, such holder will be
entitled to the fair value of such shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery plus interest, if any, on the amount determined to
be the fair value, as further described in "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 83 below.

        Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

Procedures for Surrendering Shares for Payment 

        At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Lanxess will make available to an exchange agent selected by Lanxess reasonably
acceptable to Chemtura, for the benefit of the holders of Chemtura common stock (other than excluded shares), cash in the aggregate
amount necessary for the exchange agent to make the payment of the merger consideration to Chemtura stockholders.

        Promptly after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will send to each record holder of Chemtura common stock (other
than excluded shares) at the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions for effecting the transfer of shares of
Chemtura common stock in exchange for the amount to which such stockholder is entitled as a result of the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement.

        Upon delivery of the letter of transmittal properly completed and duly executed by the applicable stockholder and receipt of an
"agent's message" by the exchange agent (or such other evidence, if any,

of transfer as the exchange agent may reasonably request), the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the merger consideration for
such shares.

        In the event of a transfer of ownership of Chemtura common stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Chemtura, payment
of the merger consideration for shares of Chemtura common stock may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered share is registered, if the share surrendered is presented to the exchange agent, along with all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and evidence that all applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

        Any portion of the funds deposited with the exchange agent for payment to the stockholders that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Chemtura for 12 months after the effective time of the merger will be delivered to Lanxess, upon demand. Any holder of
Chemtura common stock will thereafter look only to Lanxess for payment of the merger consideration.

Withholding 

        Lanxess, Chemtura, Chemtura's subsidiaries, the surviving corporation and the exchange agent are entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration and any other payments otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement such amounts as they are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are withheld, such amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

Treatment of Chemtura Equity-Based Awards 

        At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, outstanding equity-based awards (and long-term cash awards granted to
certain employees in lieu of equity-based awards) will be treated as follows:

• Each outstanding stock option, each restricted stock unit that is vested and each performance share for which the
performance period has ended will be canceled in exchange for payment to the holder of an amount in cash equal to the
merger consideration of $33.50 per share, multiplied by the number of shares of Chemtura common stock underlying such
award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of a stock option, and based on actual performance as of the end of the
performance period, in the case of a performance share). 

• Each outstanding cash award that is then vested will be canceled in exchange for payment to the holder of an amount in
cash equal to the face amount of such award. 

• Each outstanding restricted stock unit that is unvested, and each performance share for which the performance period has
not ended, will be converted into a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the merger consideration of $33.50 per share
(based on target performance, in the case of a performance share). Each such deferred award will be paid in cash in
accordance with the vesting and payment schedule applicable to the corresponding restricted stock unit or performance
share and will vest and become payable on termination of the holder's employment without "cause" or resignation for
"good reason" (except that such payment will be delayed to the extent required to avoid triggering a tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code). 

• Each outstanding cash award that is then unvested will continue as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
will vest and become payable on termination of the holder's employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason."

        No new offering period will commence under the Chemtura 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan after the end of 2016, and the plan
will be terminated effective as of the closing of the merger. The

amount credited to each participant's account on the final purchase date under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which date will be
no later than five business days prior to the closing date of the merger) will be applied to purchase the number of shares of Chemtura
common stock determined pursuant to the terms of the plan. At the effective time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the merger agreement, each such share of Chemtura common stock will be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash,
without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes.

• The organization, good standing and qualification of each of Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary; 

• The corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the merger agreement and to consummate the

Lanxess and the surviving corporation pertaining to director and officer indemnification.

Definition of "Material Adverse Effect" 

        Many of Chemtura's representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a "company material adverse effect"
standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a company material adverse effect). For purposes of the merger agreement, a "company
material adverse effect" means a material adverse effect on (i) the financial condition, business, assets or liabilities or results of operations
of Chemtura and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) Chemtura's ability to consummate the merger excluding, in the case of clause (i)
only, any effect resulting from:

• Changes in GAAP or changes in regulatory accounting requirements (or authoritative interpretations thereof);

• Subject to certain exceptions, the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or the announcement or consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the identity of or any facts or circumstances relating
specifically to Lanxess, including the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of Chemtura and any of
its subsidiaries with employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties and any stockholder litigation related thereto; 

• Any failure in and of itself by Chemtura and its subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections,
forecasts or predictions of financial performance for any period (including any analyst projections, predictions or forecasts
or any other revenue or earnings guidance) (provided that the underlying cause of any such failure may be considered in
determining whether a company material adverse effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur to the
extent not excluded by another exception in the merger agreement); 

• Any action taken (or omitted to be taken) at the request of Lanxess or Merger Subsidiary; or 

• A change in and of itself in the price and/or trading volume of the Chemtura common stock or other publicly traded
securities on NYSE or any other market in which such securities are quoted for purchase and sale (provided that the
underlying cause of any such change may be considered in determining whether a company material adverse effect has
occurred or would be reasonably expected to occur to the extent not excluded by another exemption in the merger
agreement).

        Notwithstanding these exclusions, events, changes, effects, developments, occurrences, circumstances and facts referred to in the first
four bullet points above may be considered for purposes of determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a
company material adverse effect if such event, change, effect, development, occurrence, circumstance or fact has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a disproportionate adverse effect on Chemtura and its subsidiaries, as compared to other companies operating in the
industries in which Chemtura and its subsidiaries operate.

        Certain of Lanxess' and Merger Subsidiary's representations and warranties are qualified by a "parent material adverse effect"
standard. For purposes of the merger agreement, "parent material adverse effect" means a material adverse effect on the ability of Lanxess
or Merger Subsidiary to consummate the merger.

Conduct of the Business Pending the Merger 

        Chemtura has agreed to certain covenants in the merger agreement restricting the conduct of its business between the date of the
merger agreement and the effective time of the merger. In general, except as may be required by applicable law, as expressly contemplated
by the merger agreement, as set forth on the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement, or with the prior written consent of Lanxess
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Chemtura is required to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organizations and relationships with third
parties and to keep available the services of its present officers and key employees.

• Taking any action that is intended to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Chemtura to consummate
the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• Agreeing, resolving or committing to take any of the foregoing actions.

Board Obligation to Call a Stockholders' Meeting 

        Chemtura has agreed under the merger agreement to take all actions in accordance with Delaware law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, and convene a meeting of Chemtura stockholders to
approve and adopt the merger agreement as soon as reasonably practicable. Prior to the date of the stockholders' meeting, Chemtura has
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the stockholder meeting (i) with the consent of Lanxess,
(ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for such period of time as the Chemtura board determines in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under applicable law or fiduciary duty for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Chemtura board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
necessary under applicable law or fiduciary duty and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by its
stockholders prior to the stockholders' meeting or (iv) in the event that Chemtura receives an unsolicited acquisition proposal no earlier
than ten business days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholder meeting and the Chemtura board determines in good faith that such
acquisition proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that it is required by applicable law or fiduciary duty
to postpone such scheduled meeting. With respect to items (i) through (iv) above, Chemtura shall use its reasonable best efforts to
reconvene and hold a stockholder meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals 

        Chemtura has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will not, and that it will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
subsidiaries' respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

• Solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below); 

• Enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to Chemtura or any of its
subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries to,
or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, any third party that may reasonably be expected to make, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal; 

• Enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal, other than to facilitate the sharing of information
permitted under an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below); or 

• Publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

        Chemtura also agreed to (and agreed to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all activities, discussions and negotiations with any third party and its representatives and financing sources that
may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and to promptly instruct each third party that has entered into a confidentiality
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of Chemtura to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information previously furnished in connection therewith.

        Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval of Chemtura stockholders, Chemtura
or any of its subsidiaries receives a bona fide written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Chemtura board reasonably believes may
lead to a Superior Proposal and the Chemtura board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Chemtura and its
representatives may:

• Engage in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Acquisition Proposal and its
representatives or financing sources; 

• Furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, nonpublic information with respect to Chemtura and its
subsidiaries to the person or group of persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal and its representatives or financing
sources; provided, that Chemtura will promptly (but in any event, within 24 hours) provide or make available to Lanxess
any such information that is provided to any such person which was not previously provided to or made available to
Lanxess (including, when executed, a copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement); or 

• Take any nonappealable, final action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders Chemtura to take.

        Chemtura may not take any of the actions referred to in the above bullets unless it has delivered to Lanxess prior written notice that it
intends to take such action. In addition, Chemtura has agreed to promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, provide Lanxess with notice
of receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information from any third party that is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must include the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal. In addition, Chemtura
must notify Lanxess of any material change in a previously notified Acquisition Proposal.

        Under the merger agreement, Chemtura must maintain in effect the provisions of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which
it is a party unless the Chemtura board, in consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that the failure to terminate, amend, modify
or waive such provisions would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, in which case Chemtura may
release or waive such provisions solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make an unsolicited non-public Acquisition
Proposal. If the Chemtura board waives any such provision, it must advise Lanxess orally and in writing no later than 24 hours after any
such waiver.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means one or more confidentiality agreements either
in effect as of the date of the merger agreement or that contains terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate (including non-disclosure
provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate) to Chemtura than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between
Chemtura and Lanxess. In addition, such confidentiality agreements may omit standstill provisions or include less restrictive standstill
provisions than the standstill provision in the confidentiality agreement between Chemtura and Lanxess.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide offer, proposal or inquiry (other than the merger)
relating to, through one transaction or a series of related transactions (i) any acquisition or purchase, directly or indirectly, of 15% or more
of the consolidated assets of Chemtura and its subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Chemtura or any
of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Chemtura, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning
15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Chemtura or

(iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, partnership, sale of substantially all the assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Chemtura.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of Chemtura stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Chemtura and its subsidiaries on terms
which the Chemtura board determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and its
outside legal counsel) by a majority vote (i) are more favorable to Chemtura stockholders than the merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including the timing, likelihood of consummation, ability to finance, regulatory and other similarly relevant aspects of such
proposal), and any proposal made by Lanxess (and not revoked) to modify the terms of the merger agreement and (ii) would result in the
owners of the capital stock of Chemtura as of immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition
Proposal, collectively, owning less than a majority of the capital stock of the acquirer or resulting entity in such transaction immediately
after such consummation.

Changes in Board Recommendation 

        Except as provided in the paragraphs below, under the terms of the merger agreement, the Chemtura board has agreed not to
withhold, qualify, change, fail to make (including any failure to reaffirm within five business days of a request from Lanxess following the
making of a public acquisition proposal or any publicly disclosed change to the material terms thereof), withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Lanxess the Chemtura board's recommendation in favor of the merger (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal) (any of the
foregoing being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to approval and adoption by Chemtura stockholders of the merger agreement, the Chemtura
board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event (as defined below)
and terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal if:

• Such Acquisition Proposal did not result from any breach of the obligations described in the section entitled "—
Restrictions on Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 92 of this proxy statement; 

• The Chemtura board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law and that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; 

• Chemtura provides Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary at least four business days' prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and which notice, if the intended Adverse Recommendation Change is not the result of a Superior Proposal,
must specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change or, if the intended Adverse
Recommendation Change is the result of a Superior Proposal, must specify the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal and the material terms thereof; 

• Following such notice Chemtura negotiates with Lanxess in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement as would permit Chemtura not to effect a Adverse Recommendation Change; 

• The Chemtura board considers in good faith any changes to the merger agreement offered in writing by Lanxess during
such notice period and (i) if the intended Adverse Recommendation

Change is the result of a Superior Proposal, determines in good faith after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel that the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to effect a
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties or (ii) if the
intended Adverse Recommendation Change is the result of an Intervening Event determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel that failure to effect a Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties; and

• In the event of any revisions to the terms of such Superior Proposal, Chemtura has, in each case, delivered to Lanxess an
additional notice consistent with the notice requirement described in the third bullet above and the conditions described in
the fourth and fifth bullets above have been satisfied again, except that the notice period will be three business days (rather
than four business days).

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "Intervening Event" means an event, development or change in circumstances material to
Chemtura and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, first occurring or arising after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the approval
and adoption by Chemtura stockholders of the merger agreement. Such event must relate to Chemtura (but not relate to any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Proposal) and must not have been known nor reasonably foreseeable by the Chemtura board prior to the date of the
merger agreement. Changes or events generally affecting Chemtura's industry that have not had or would not reasonably be expected to
have a disproportionate effect on Chemtura and/or its subsidiaries constitute an Intervening Event.

Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger 

        Subject to certain exceptions described below and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Chemtura and Lanxess have
agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable laws to consummate, as soon as reasonably practicable, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any governmental
authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any governmental entity or other third party that are necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under any regulatory law or if
any proceeding is instituted or threatened by any governmental authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, Lanxess, Merger Subsidiary and Chemtura have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections as promptly as reasonably practicable, including by (i) agreeing to hold separate or divest businesses or properties
or assets, (ii) terminating or creating existing relationships and contracts, (iii) terminating existing ventures, (iv) effectuating changes or
restructurings, (v) opposing, including through litigation, any actions or proceedings initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement that would restrain, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and (vi) commencing any action that may be required to resolve any objections to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and to avoid the entry of any order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Notwithstanding the obligations described in the two preceding paragraphs, in no event will Lanxess or its subsidiaries be required to:
(i) commit to any undertaking, divestiture, license or similar arrangement, (ii) terminate or modify any relationships, rights or obligations
or (iii) do any other act or refrain from any act, in each case, to the extent such action would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Lanxess, Chemtura and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being understood
that for purposes of Lanxess' regulatory undertaking, Lanxess, Chemtura and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be
deemed to be the size of Chemtura and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to the merger).

        From the signing of the merger agreement until the effective time, Lanxess has agreed not to take any action that is intended to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Lanxess to consummate the merger.

Litigation Related to the Merger 

        Chemtura has agreed to give Lanxess the reasonable opportunity to participate, at Lanxess' expense, in (but not control) the defense
or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Chemtura or its directors and any other lawsuit or proceeding relating to or challenging
the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Chemtura has agreed that it will not offer to settle or settle any litigation or
other legal proceeding against it or any of its directors, officers, employees, advisors or agents and relating to the merger or the merger
agreement without the prior written consent of Lanxess, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Employee Matters 

        Under the merger agreement, Lanxess has agreed to take the following actions with respect to the compensation and benefits of
Chemtura employees who remain employed with Chemtura or Lanxess:

• For 24 months, each employee will receive a base salary or wage rate and annual target bonus opportunity that is no less
favorable than those that the employee received immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and will remain entitled to
any severance protections under the Chemtura Executive and Key Employee Severance Plan and the Chemtura Severance
Plan. 

• For 12 months, each employee will receive employees benefits (other than short- or long-term cash or equity incentives)
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the employee immediately prior to the closing of
the merger. 

• Lanxess has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take the following actions under its benefit plans: 

• Recognize pre-closing service with Chemtura for vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement purposes (other than
benefit accrual purposes under defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical plans); 

• Waive any pre-existing condition limitations plans to the same extent waived under analogous Chemtura plans; and 

• Provide credit for the pre-closing portion of 2017 under analogous Chemtura benefit plans for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums under Lanxess plans. 

• Each employee will receive credit for earned but unused vacation and personal holiday pay, to the extent reflected in
Chemtura's books and records or otherwise disclosed to Lanxess.

Table of Contents

        Chemtura and Lanxess have also agreed to take the following actions with respect to compensation and benefits for Chemtura
employees:

• Chemtura will ensure that no new offering period commences under the Chemtura 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
after the end of 2016, and to terminate the plan effective as of the closing of the merger. 

• Chemtura will pay to each participant in the Management Incentive Plan and Sales Incentive Plan the pro-rata portion of
the amount that the participant would have earned for the year of Closing under such plan, based on performance achieved
through the closing date of the merger, as determined by Chemtura in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. In addition, if the payments under the plans earned for 2016 have not yet been paid when the merger closes,
Lanxess will make the payments in amounts determined in accordance with the terms of the plans in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice as soon as practicable following the completion of Chemtura's audited consolidated
financial statements for 2016, based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals. 

• Chemtura will make a profit sharing contribution for 2017 to each participant's account under Chemtura's Employee
Savings Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan, in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of the amount of the profit sharing
contribution that would have been made for such participant under such plan for 2017, based on performance achieved
through the merger closing date. In addition, if the merger closes before the profit sharing contributions for 2016 are made
to such plans, Lanxess will make a profit sharing contribution to the account of each such participant in such plans as soon
as practicable following the completion of Chemtura's audited consolidated financial statements for 2016, based on the
achievement of the applicable performance goals.

Effective as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger, Chemtura will terminate the Employee Savings Plan (unless Lanxess
provides at least 15 business days' written notice to the contrary). If the plan is terminated, Lanxess will cause a 401(k) plan maintained by
Lanxess or one of its subsidiaries to accept a direct rollover from the Employee Savings Plan of account balances (including loans) of
Chemtura employees who elect such rollover.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance 

        For six years after the effective time of the merger, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in accordance with the applicable organizational documents of Chemtura
and its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, each Indemnified Person against all Proceedings to which the
Indemnified Person is made a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Person is otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising
in whole or in part out of or pertaining in whole or in part to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of Chemtura or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Chemtura as such for another enterprise
(including any Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring or existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred, at or prior to the effective time of the merger, or arising out of or pertaining to the merger
agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated thereby). In addition, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to
advance expenses (subject to certain conditions) as incurred to the Indemnified Persons and to cooperate in the defense of any Proceeding.

        For six years after the effective time of the merger, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect the
provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers and
directors and advances of expenses

that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of the merger
agreement.

        From and after the effective time of the merger, Lanxess has agreed to cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to honor
and comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person, and not amend or modify
any such agreement in any manner that would adversely affect any right of any Indemnified Person.

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, Chemtura will or, if Chemtura is unable to, Lanxess will and will cause the surviving
corporation as of the effective time of the merger to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of Chemtura's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and Chemtura's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case for six years from the effective time of the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will
the surviving corporation be required to expend for such policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium
that Chemtura paid for such insurance in its last full fiscal year.

        If Chemtura or the surviving corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation will continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the effective time of
the merger, the directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in place as of the date of the merger agreement
with Chemtura's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Chemtura's current insurance
carrier with respect to such insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage
provided under Chemtura's existing policies as of the date of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will
Lanxess or the surviving corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premium that Chemtura paid for such insurance in its last full fiscal year.

Takeover Provisions 

        If any state takeover statute or similar statute is or becomes applicable to the merger, the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, Chemtura and the Chemtura board have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by the merger agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statutes or regulations on such
transactions.

Financing of the Merger 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Lanxess AG entered into the Credit Agreement. Lanxess intends to use
borrowings under the Credit Agreement along with cash on hand to finance the merger and pay related expenses.

        In the merger agreement, Lanxess represented that, assuming satisfaction of certain conditions and the performance by Chemtura of
its obligations under the merger agreement, Lanxess has, or will have at the effective time of the merger, sufficient cash, available lines of
credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to consummate the merger including sufficient funds (i) to pay the
merger consideration, (ii) to make all payments in respect of Chemtura stock options, RSUs and performance shares and (iii) to pay all
related fees and expenses of Lanxess, Merger Subsidiary and their respective representatives. In addition, Lanxess provided Chemtura with
a true and complete copy (subject to customary redactions) of the Credit Agreement substantially concurrently with the execution of the
merger agreement and represented that such agreement was in full force and effect and was a

valid and binding obligation (subject to certain enforceability exceptions) on Lanxess AG and, to the knowledge of Lanxess, the lenders
party thereto.

        Furthermore, Lanxess has agreed to promptly notify Chemtura if Lanxess AG receives written notice from the lenders party to the
Credit Agreement of any termination of the commitments under the Credit Agreement (other than any such termination in connection with
other financings in connection with the merger or asset sales that reduce the commitments in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement). In the event that any portion of the Credit Agreement becomes unavailable, other than as a result of receipt of proceeds from
other financings or asset sales, Lanxess will promptly notify Chemtura, and if Lanxess will not otherwise have access to funds in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to pay all fees and expenses payable by
Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary, in connection with the merger, Lanxess or its affiliates will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or customary to arrange and obtain alternative financing in an
amount sufficient to meet such obligations and without terms that would impose new or additional conditions precedent to funding such
alternative financing that are more restrictive in any material respects than those contained in the Credit Agreement.

        In the merger agreement, Chemtura has agreed to, to cause its subsidiaries to, to use its reasonable best efforts to cause, and to
instruct, its and their respective representatives to, and to authorize and permit its and their representatives to, cooperate with Lanxess and
its subsidiaries and its and their representatives in connection with the arrangement, marketing or consummation of the financing of the
merger and the preparation of financial and other information relating to Chemtura necessary or customary for Lanxess AG to comply with
its reporting and disclosure obligations (subject to certain limitations) as and when reasonably requested by Lanxess (so long as such
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Chemtura and its subsidiaries), including by, among other
things and subject to specified limitations: (i) furnishing to Lanxess and its financing sources certain financial statements and related
information, (ii) discussing with Lanxess and its financing sources the preparation of Chemtura's financial statements and other related
materials, (iii) making Chemtura's senior officers available for and requesting that Chemtura's independent accountants and other advisors
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the financing of the merger and (iv) delivering customary payoff letters relating to certain of the
existing indebtedness of Chemtura and its subsidiaries. In addition, Chemtura has agreed to take certain actions with respect to its
outstanding 5.75% Notes due July 15, 2021 if requested by Lanxess, including, subject to certain limitations, (i) taking actions to effect a
redemption of such Notes or providing cooperation to Lanxess to facilitate the redemption of such Notes, (ii) using its reasonable best
efforts to take actions to satisfy and discharge such Notes or providing cooperation to Lanxess to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of
such Notes or (iii) using its reasonable best efforts to commence offers to purchase, redeem or exchange such Notes. Chemtura has also
agreed, if requested by Lanxess, to use, and to cause its subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to assist, support and cooperate with
Lanxess to allow Lanxess to seek an amendment to Chemtura's Senior Secured Revolving Facilities Credit Agreement, as amended and
restated as of December 4, 2013 to, among other things, obtain consent to the merger and related transactions.

        Chemtura and its subsidiaries are not required to pay any commitment or similar fees in connection with the foregoing, and, upon the
written request of Chemtura, Lanxess will reimburse Chemtura for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Chemtura
or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing.

contemplated to be performed by it at or prior to the effective time of the merger;

Amendments, Waivers 

        At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, the parties may amend or waive any provision of the merger agreement. Any
such amendment must be in writing and signed by each party to the merger agreement and any such waiver must be in writing and signed

agreement, there will be no amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of the Chemtura stockholders under Delaware
law without such approval having first been obtained.

the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware (and in
each case, any appellate court therefrom) for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each
party further irrevocably waived any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to the merger agreement
or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Dividend Policy 

        Chemtura has never paid, and does not have any plans to pay, cash dividends on its common stock. Until the effective time of the
merger, the merger agreement does not permit Chemtura to declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash,
stock or property or any combination thereof), except for dividends by any of its wholly owned subsidiaries which would not result in any
liability to any third party, without the prior written consent of Lanxess.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        Under the DGCL, you have the right to demand an appraisal of your shares and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your
common stock (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain
circumstances described herein, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by Chemtura as
the surviving corporation in the merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding),
in lieu of the consideration you would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. These rights are known as
appraisal rights. Chemtura stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
as in effect on September 25, 2016, the date of the parties' entry into the merger agreement ("Section 262 of the DGCL" or "Section 262"),
in order to perfect their rights.

        The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed
by a stockholder in order to dissent from the merger and perfect appraisal rights.

        This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to precisely follow any of the
statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in a termination or waiver of your appraisal rights. All references in
this summary to a "stockholder" are to the record holder of shares of Chemtura common stock unless otherwise indicated.

        Section 262 requires that stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than 20 days before the stockholders'
meeting to vote on the merger.

        A copy of Section 262 must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes Chemtura's notice to its stockholders of
the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262.

        Chemtura stockholders who may wish to exercise their appraisal rights or may wish to preserve their right to do so should
review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex C carefully and in its entirety and should consult with their legal advisor, since
failure to timely comply with the procedures set forth therein will result in the loss of such rights.

        If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:

• You must deliver to Chemtura a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger is
taken. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or
voting against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. Voting "AGAINST" or failing to vote "FOR" the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of
Section 262.

meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the internet), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the
shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. Because shares represented by a proxy
that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must indicate that the shares
represented by the proxy are to be voted against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, or indicate that the
shares shall abstain from voting. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement, nor abstaining from voting
or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate
from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. 

• You must continuously hold the shares of record from the date of making the demand through the effective time. Therefore,
a stockholder who is the record holder of shares of Chemtura common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is
made but who thereafter transfers the shares prior to the effective date of the merger will lose any right to appraisal with
respect to such shares.

        If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration for your shares of common stock as provided in the merger agreement, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to
your shares of common stock.

        All demands for appraisal should be addressed to Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury, Connecticut 06749, Attn:
Corporate Secretary, and must be delivered before the vote on the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting, and should be
executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of our common stock. The demand must reasonably inform Chemtura of the
identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. To be effective, a demand for
appraisal by a holder of our common stock must be made by, or in the name of, such registered stockholder.

        Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for such shares of our common
stock registered in that holder's name.

• Beneficial owners who do not also hold the shares of record may not directly make appraisal demands to Chemtura. The
beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as a broker, fiduciary, depository or other nominee,
submit the required demand in respect of those shares. 

• If shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for
appraisal should be made by or for the fiduciary. 

• If the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should
be executed by or for all joint owners. 

• An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for
a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that,
in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owners. 

• A record owner, who holds shares as a nominee for others, such as a broker, may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal
with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial
owners. In that case, a demand for appraisal

Table of Contents

of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the nominee and must identify the nominee as record holder. The written
demand should also state the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly
mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner.

        If your shares of common stock are owned of record by another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depository or other
nominee, and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker or other intermediary to determine the
appropriate procedures for the record holder to make a demand for appraisal. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of
common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, must act
promptly to cause the record holder to properly follow the steps summarized below and perfect appraisal rights in a timely
manner. If your common stock is held through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository
nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and
must identify the depository nominee as record holder.

        As required by Section 262 of the DGCL, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform Chemtura of the
identity of the record holder (which might be a nominee as described above) and of such holder's intention to seek appraisal of such shares.

        Within ten days after the effective time of the merger, Chemtura, as the surviving corporation, must provide notice of the date the
merger has become effective to each former Chemtura stockholder who has properly demanded appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. At any time within 60 days after the
effective time, any stockholder who has demanded an appraisal and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw the demand for appraisal and to accept the cash payment specified by the merger
agreement for his, her or its shares of common stock. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effectiveness of the
merger will require the written approval of the surviving corporation or, following the filing of a petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery.

        Section 262 of the DGCL provides that if immediately prior to a transaction such as the merger the shares of the class or series of
stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware
Chancery Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value
of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

        Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or any stockholder who has complied with
the requirements of Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of Chemtura common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own
name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such
petition will be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation to file such a petition in the event there
are stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares under Section 262. There is no present intent on the part of Chemtura to
file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Chemtura will file such a petition or
that Chemtura will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, the stockholders who desire to have
their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the
manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure

of a stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified could nullify the stockholder's previously written demand for appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 will, upon written request
to the surviving company, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the
merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares.

        A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may,
in such person's own name, request from the corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. Such written statement will be
mailed to the requesting stockholder within ten days after such written request is received by the surviving corporation or within ten days
after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is served upon the surviving corporation, the
surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving
corporation. If the petition is filed by the surviving corporation, it must be accompanied by such a list. After providing notice to
stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their shares if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition and to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262
and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates, if any, to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such
direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

        After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of common stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
conduct an appraisal proceeding in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of such shares
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, on the
amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between
the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the
surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance against the
payment due to such stockholder), in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such
value, together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be fair value, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same upon the
surrender by such holders of the certificates representing their shares, if any, or, in the case of any uncertificated shares, forthwith.

        In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. You should be aware
that the fair value of your shares as determined under

Section 262 could be more than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger
agreement and that an opinion of an investment banker or financial advisor as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
merger consideration is not necessarily an opinion as to fair value for purposes of Section 262. Moreover, Chemtura does not
anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to
assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of stock is less than the merger
consideration.

        In determining "fair value," the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial
community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant
factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value the
court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which could
be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that
fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that "elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders participating in the appraisal
proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs
do not include attorneys' fees and expert witness fees. Each dissenting stockholder is responsible for his, her or its attorneys' and expert
witness expenses, although, upon the application of a dissenting stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who
had demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any
purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of
a record date prior to the effective time of the merger; however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time
of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of
the merger within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and the shares of
common stock held by that stockholder will be deemed to have converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the
merger consideration for his, her or its shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Any withdrawal of a demand for
appraisal made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger may only be made with the written approval of the surviving
corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the prior approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party will maintain the right to withdraw its demand for appraisal and to accept the merger
consideration that such holder would have received pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.

        In view of the complexity of Section 262, Chemtura stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue
appraisal rights should consult their legal advisors.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS (PROPOSAL 2)

        As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Chemtura is required to submit a
proposal to Chemtura stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by Chemtura of certain compensation that will
or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. This proposal, commonly
known as "say-on-golden parachutes," and which we refer to as the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, gives
Chemtura stockholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation. This compensation is summarized in the table under "The Merger—Interests of Chemtura's Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation" beginning on page 78 of this proxy statement, including the footnotes to the
table.

        The Chemtura board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information
disclosed in this proxy statement.

        The Chemtura board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Chemtura approve the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Chemtura hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the agreements or understandings
with and compensation to be paid or become payable by Chemtura to its named executive officers that are based on or otherwise relate to
the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute Compensation table, the footnotes to that table
and the accompanying narrative disclosure."

        The vote on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the named executive officer merger-related compensation is a
vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice
versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either Chemtura or Lanxess. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation
will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Chemtura
stockholders.

        The above resolution approving the named executive officer merger-related compensation on an advisory basis will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting (provided a quorum is present in person or represented by proxy).

        The Chemtura board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
certain compensation that will or may be paid by Chemtura to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3)

        Chemtura stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal to, as permitted under the terms of the merger agreement, adjourn the
special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement if there
are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If this proposal to adjourn the special
meeting is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by Chemtura as permitted

under the terms of the merger agreement to any date. In addition, Chemtura, as permitted under the terms of the merger agreement, could
postpone the special meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other reasons. If the
special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be
able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, your
shares will be voted in favor of such proposal.

        If a quorum does not exist at the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), under our bylaws, the holders of a
majority of the shares of Chemtura common stock entitled to vote thereat present at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy,
may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time, or the chairman of the meeting, our Chief Executive Officer, or our
president may adjourn the special meeting to another date, place or time. If a quorum exists, but there are not enough affirmative votes to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, the special meeting may be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
Chemtura stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting.

        The Chemtura board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, including if
necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

• U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; 

• Partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• Persons who acquired Chemtura common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation; 

• Certain financial institutions and insurance companies; 

• Regulated investment companies; 

• Real estate investment trusts; 

• Certain former citizens or residents of the United States; 

• Tax-exempt entities, including an "individual retirement account" or "Roth IRA;" or 

• Persons subject to the United States alternative minimum tax.

        If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Chemtura common stock, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships
holding Chemtura common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to them.

        This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary Treasury
regulations, all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax considerations under state,
local and foreign laws are not addressed.

U.S. Holders 

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Chemtura common stock that is:

• A citizen or resident of the United States; 

• A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• An estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• A trust (A) if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) that has elected to be treated as a U.S.
person under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations.

        The exchange of Chemtura common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Chemtura common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize
capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received
with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis generally will equal
the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Chemtura common
stock (i.e., shares of Chemtura common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally will be treated
as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period in the shares of Chemtura common stock exceeds one year at the time
of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at

Table of Contents

preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates
also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.

Non-U.S. Holders 

        A "non-U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of Chemtura common stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership. Payments made to a
non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Chemtura common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:

• The gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States
(or, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder's permanent establishment or fixed
base in the United States); 

• The non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
exchange of shares of Chemtura common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions are met; or 

• The non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the
Chemtura common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Chemtura is or has been a
"United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the
five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held Chemtura common stock.

        A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain
realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. If such non-U.S.
holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits
(or a lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30%
(or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year,
even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.

        Chemtura believes it has not been a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any
time during the five-year period preceding the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

        Payments made in exchange for shares of Chemtura common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the
holder is an "exempt recipient" and may also be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28%. To avoid backup withholding, U.S.
holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such
U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup
withholding. A non-U.S. holder that provides the applicable withholding agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-
8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.

        Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a holder's
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

        You are urged to consult your tax adviser with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular
circumstances as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state,
local or foreign tax laws.

FUTURE CHEMTURA STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        It is not expected that Chemtura will hold its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders unless the merger is not completed. If the merger is
not completed during the first half of 2017, Chemtura stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in Chemtura's
annual meeting of stockholders. If Chemtura holds its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder director nominations and
proposals intended to be presented for inclusion in Chemtura's proxy statement and accompanying proxy card pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of
the Exchange Act for such meeting must have been received at Chemtura's principal executive offices at the address listed below, on or
before December 2, 2016, and must have met the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. For director nominations the notice
must describe various matters regarding the nominee, as set forth in Article II, Section 11 of Chemtura's bylaws, which are posted on our
website at www.chemtura.com.

        In addition, if a stockholder intends to nominate a director or raise a matter at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if such
meeting is held, and has not sought inclusion of the nomination or matter in Chemtura's proxy statement and accompanying proxy card for
such meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, the stockholder must comply with the advance notice provisions in
Chemtura's bylaws. These advance notice provisions require stockholders to deliver to Chemtura notice of a director nomination or
proposal to be considered at an annual meeting not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days in advance of the date which is the
anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting, which, with respect to the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, means not
later than February 4, 2017 and not earlier than January 5, 2017, respectively. However, if the number of directors to be elected to the
board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by Chemtura naming the nominees for the additional
directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice will also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it is delivered to the secretary at the principal
executive offices of Chemtura not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement
is first made by Chemtura. Any such director nominations or proposals are also subject to informational and other requirements set forth in
Chemtura's bylaws. Such director nominations or proposals should have been submitted to the following address:

Chemtura Corporation
Attn: Corporate Secretary

199 Benson Road
Middlebury, Connecticut 06749

        The above deadlines would change if Chemtura holds its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders on a date that is more than 30 days
before or more than 70 days after the anniversary of the date of its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or
proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding,"
potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

        Chemtura and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple stockholders who
request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have
received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until
you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would
prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual

report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Chemtura if you are a stockholder of record. You can
notify us by sending a written request to Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury, Connecticut 06749, Attn: Corporate
Secretary, or calling (203) 573-2000. Stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may
request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Chemtura at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In
addition, Chemtura will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the
proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION 

        Chemtura is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, Chemtura files annual, quarterly and current

Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, from the date of this proxy statement until the date of the special meeting; provided,
however, that we are not incorporating by reference any additional documents or information furnished and not filed with the SEC.

        You may request a copy of documents incorporated by reference at no cost, by writing or telephoning the office of the Corporate
Secretary at Chemtura Corporation, 199 Benson Road, Middlebury, Connecticut 06749, Tel. (203) 573-2000.

THE MERGER 

        Section 2.01    The Merger.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

        (b)   Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place in New York City at the
offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as possible, but in any event
no later than five Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing)
have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such
other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

        (c)   At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at
such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

        (d)   From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all
as provided under Delaware Law.

        Section 2.02    Conversion of Shares.     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary:

        (a)   Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c), Section 2.04 or Section 2.05, each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without
interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

        (b)   Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        (c)   Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        (d)   Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and, except as provided in Section 2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

        Section 2.03    Surrender and Payment.     

        (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent")
for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the
"Certificates") if any or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares. Such funds may be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable hereunder and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any
such losses and (ii) such investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors
Service, Inc., respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than two Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange, as applicable.

        (b)   Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the

Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case
may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration.

        (c)   If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

        (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Article 2.

        (e)   Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any
interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock twelve months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (f)    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to establish customary procedures with
the Exchange Agent with respect to the prompt transmission to the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee of
immediately available funds of an aggregate amount of Merger Consideration with respect to the number of shares of Company
Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        Section 2.04    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by
Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

        Section 2.05    Company Stock Awards.     

        (a)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is then-outstanding under the Company Stock Plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall, automatically
and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of such Company
Stock Option for each such Company Stock Option an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (assuming full vesting of the Company Stock Option) had such holder exercised the
Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award relating to shares of Company Stock
(other than a Company Performance Share), whether settled in cash or in stock (each, a "Company RSU"), that is then-outstanding
under the Company Stock Plan and unvested, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof,
shall be converted to a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of
shares of Company Stock represented by such Company RSU (the "RSU Consideration"). The RSU Consideration shall continue
to be subject to the same terms and conditions of the Company RSU award as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
shall be paid solely in cash in accordance with the vesting and payment schedule applicable to the Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, the RSU Consideration shall vest and become payable upon the Company RSU
holder's Involuntary Termination. For the avoidance of doubt, a Director Stock Deferral (as defined in the Chemtura Corporation
Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors Plan) is a Company RSU for all purposes under this Agreement.

        (c)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is then-outstanding under the Company Stock
Plan and vested (but for which the underlying shares of Company Stock have not yet been delivered), automatically and without
any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay the holder of any such
Company RSU an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Stock
represented by such Company RSU.

        (d)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each performance share award relating to shares of Company Stock,
whether settled in cash or in stock (each, a "Company Performance Share"), that is then-outstanding under the Company Stock
Plan, and for which the applicable performance period has not ended, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder
or beneficiary thereof, shall be converted to a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration
and the number of shares of Company Stock represented by such Company Performance Share, which number shall be determined
based on the target performance level (the "PS Consideration"). The PS Consideration shall continue to be subject to the same
terms and conditions of the Company Performance Share award as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be
paid solely in cash in accordance with the vesting and payment schedule applicable to the Company Performance Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, the PS Consideration shall vest and become payable upon the Company
Performance Share holder's Involuntary Termination.

        (e)   At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Performance Share that is then-outstanding under the
Company Stock Plan and for which the applicable performance period has ended (but for which the underlying shares of Company
Stock have not yet been delivered), automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof, shall be
canceled, and the Company shall pay the holder of any such Company Performance Share an

amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Stock represented by such
Company Performance Share, which number shall be determined based on actual performance as of the end of the applicable
performance period.

At the Effective Time, each long-term cash award set forth on Section 2.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Cash
Award") that is then-outstanding and unvested, shall continue as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, the
Cash Award shall vest and become payable upon the Cash Award holder's Involuntary Termination. At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Cash Award that is then-outstanding and vested (but for which the cash has not yet been paid) shall be
canceled, and the Company shall pay the holder of any such Cash Award an amount in cash equal to the face amount of such Cash
Award.

        (f)    Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to make any amendments to the terms of (and
use reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consents under) any outstanding Company Stock Option, Company RSU,
Company Performance Share or Cash Award (collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05 and to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Company Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Equity Awards. All payments under this Section 2.05 shall be made at or as soon as practicable following
the contemplated payment date (and in all events not later than 60 days after the contemplated payment date), pursuant to the
Company's ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding; provided that any payments that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that cannot be paid on the contemplated
payment date without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the earliest date thereafter that
will not trigger such Tax or penalty.

        Section 2.06    Adjustments.     If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise
of Company Stock Options or the settlement of Company RSUs or Company Performance Shares, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. Nothing in this Section 2.06 shall be construed to permit any
party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

        Section 2.07    Withholding Rights.     Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent,
the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

        Section 2.08    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article 2.

the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (A) that the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary relating to
the incorporator of Merger Subsidiary shall be omitted and (B) as otherwise required by Section 7.04(b), and as so amended shall be the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law.
Nothing in this Section 3.01 shall affect in any way the indemnification obligations provided for in Section 7.04(b).

        Section 3.02    Bylaws.     The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

        Subject to Section 11.05, except as (x) disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed between January 1, 2014 (provided, that with
respect to Sections 4.12 and 4.19 items disclosed in documents that would be SEC Documents but for the fact that they were filed before
January 1, 2014 but after January 1, 2013) and the date of this Agreement or (y) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that:

        Section 4.01    Corporate Existence and Power.     The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material

        Section 6.04    No Solicitation; Other Offers.

which it is a party for a Third Party who has indicated to the Company its desire to make an unsolicited non-public bona fide
Acquisition Proposal to the Company that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes may lead to a Superior
Proposal but which Third Party is unable to do so because of such "standstill" provision or agreement, solely to the extent
necessary to permit the counterparty to such "standstill" provision or agreement to make an unsolicited non-public Acquisition
Proposal to the Company, if, prior to such release or waiver, the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors'
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, further, that the Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing no later than
24 hours after any such release or waiver and the Company shall promptly provide such release or waiver. Subject to
Section 6.04(b) and Section 6.04(c), on the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any,

obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives has
received a bona fide written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes may
lead to a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside

event, within 24 hours) after (i) receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request
for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including if
the Acquisition Proposal is in writing by providing copies of any material amendments or other material documents thereto) and
(ii) any material change (including any change as to price) in a previously notified Acquisition Proposal. The Company hereby
agrees that after the date hereof it shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement that prohibits or
restricts it from providing to Parent the information contemplated by this Section 6.04(d) or complying with Section 6.04(e).

Section 6.04, prior to, but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company's Board of Directors
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, if the Company's
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties

under Applicable Law and, in the event of such an Adverse Recommendation Change that is a result of a Superior Proposal, the
Company's Board of Directors may also take action pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) of this Agreement in connection with accepting
a Superior Proposal as contemplated herein; provided, that prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change or action pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i) of this Agreement:

          (i)  the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, at least four Business
Days in advance of its intention to effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or to take action pursuant to Section 10.01(d)
(i), which notice, if the intended Adverse Recommendation Change is not the result of a Superior Proposal, shall specify in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change (including a reasonably detailed description of the
Intervening Event) and, if concerning an intended Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of a Superior
Proposal, shall specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof;

         (ii)  after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or taking such action
pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger
Subsidiary in good faith (if and to the extent Parent and Merger Subsidiary indicate to the Company their desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company not to
effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or take such action pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) in response to such a
Superior Proposal; and

        (iii)  the Company's Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in
writing by Parent (and not revoked) during or prior to such four Business Day period and (x) if the intended Adverse
Recommendation Change or the action pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) is the result of a Superior Proposal, shall have
determined in good faith after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect and that failure to effect
a Adverse Recommendation Change or take the action pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) would reasonably be expected to
violate the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, as the case may be, and (y) if the intended Adverse
Recommendation Change is the result of an Intervening Event and not the result of a Superior Proposal, shall have
determined in good faith after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel that failure to effect
a Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law if such changes were to be given effect;

provided, that, if the intended Adverse Recommendation Change is the result of a Superior Proposal or in the case of an action
pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), in the event of any material revision to such Superior Proposal, including any revision to price, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 6.04(e) with respect to such new written notice; provided that in connection with each new notice contemplated by this
section, each reference to the four Business Day period in this Section 6.04(e) shall be deemed to be a three Business Day period.
For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Company's Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, otherwise in compliance with this
Section 6.04(e), only in response to (A) the Company receiving an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal and not involving a material and willful breach of this Section 6.04(e) of this Agreement or (B) an
Intervening Event.

connection with the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (unless the Revolver Amendment has been executed and delivered prior to
the Closing Date), the Existing Term Credit Facility and, to the extent requested by Parent, the HP Note and any other indebtedness
referred to in clause (ix)(4) above (it being understood that the Company shall have no obligation to pay or discharge any such
indebtedness prior to the Effective Time, and the funding required for such payoff, discharge and termination shall be the
responsibility of Parent).

To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions prior to the Closing to
facilitate Parent's or the Company's payoff, discharge and termination of the Existing China Facilities at or after the Closing (it
being understood that the Company shall have no obligation to pay or discharge any such indebtedness prior to the Effective Time,
and the funding required for such payoff, discharge and termination shall be the responsibility of Parent).

        (b)   If requested in writing by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (1) issue one or more notices of
optional redemption for any or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of any of the Existing Notes (together with all

(but in all events no earlier than the Effective Time). The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on each of the notices and other documents contemplated by this Section 6.05(b) reasonably in advance of their
delivery and, after consultation with Parent with respect to any such comments, shall accept such comments that are not
unreasonable. Any such Redemption pursuant to this Section 6.05(b) shall be conditioned on the Closing having occurred (or
occurring concurrently) and shall be conducted in accordance with the Existing Indenture and Applicable Law.

        (c)   If requested in writing by Parent, (i) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such further actions as
necessary in order to satisfy and discharge the Existing Notes no earlier than the Closing Date (but in all events no earlier than the
Effective Time) (the "Satisfaction and Discharge"), (ii) the Company shall deliver an officer's certificate of the Company and use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver an opinion of the Company's counsel, in each case, in accordance with the Existing Indenture,

reasonably requested by Parent (which shall not require any payment by the Company or its Subsidiaries but may include sending
notices related to such Satisfaction and Discharge to the Trustee and holders of Notes) to facilitate the Satisfaction and Discharge.
Upon completion of the Satisfaction and Discharge (which for the avoidance of doubt, will take place no earlier than the Closing
Date), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to promptly deliver to the Company and Parent an
acknowledgement that the Satisfaction and Discharge has been completed. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on each of the notices and other documents contemplated by this Section 6.05(c) reasonably in
advance of delivery and, after consultation with Parent with respect to any such comments, shall accept such comments that are not
unreasonable. Any such Satisfaction and Discharge pursuant to this Section 6.05(c) shall be conditioned on the Closing having
occurred (or occurring concurrently) and shall be conducted in accordance with the Existing Indenture and Applicable Law.

        (d)   As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request by Parent to do so, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to commence offers to purchase (including any Change of Control Offer (as defined in the Existing
Indenture)), redeem or exchange, and to conduct consent solicitations related to any or all of the Existing Notes, on such terms and
conditions, including pricing terms and amendments to the terms and provisions of the Existing Indenture, that are specified and
requested, from time to time, by Parent and each of which shall be conditioned on, and effective only at or after, the Closing Date

provided, however, that the Company may be required to enter into a supplemental indenture prior to the Closing that is only
operative at or after the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct its and its Subsidiaries
respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Debt Tender Offers, including using reasonable best efforts to provide customary information to Parent to allow Parent to
prepare the required offers to purchase, consent solicitation statements, letters of transmittal, supplemental indentures and/or forms
of consent and other related documentation. The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent
retained in connection with the Debt Tender Offers shall be selected by Parent. The Company shall (i) waive any of the conditions
to the Debt Tender Offers and make any change to the Debt Tender Offers, as may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than
any condition related to the occurrence of the Closing or to require effectiveness prior to Closing) and (ii) if reasonably requested
in writing by Parent, extend the offer period and consent period applicable to a Debt Tender Offer to a date selected by Parent.

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the notices and other documents delivered in connection with any Debt Tender
Offer reasonably in advance of their delivery and, after consultation with the Company with respect to any such comments, accept
any such comments that are not unreasonable. Without the written consent of Parent, the Company shall not waive any condition to
any Debt Tender Offers or make any changes to any Debt Tender Offer (provided that the Company shall take such actions as it
reasonably determines are necessary or advisable to comply with the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Term Credit
Facility, the Existing Notes and Applicable Law).

        (e)   If requested in writing by Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable after such request, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to assist, support and cooperate with Parent, including by making introductions,
providing advice and information and, if requested by Parent, attending meetings, to allow Parent to seek an amendment to the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, on behalf of the Company (the "Revolver Amendment"), in order to obtain consent to the
Merger and the other transactions hereunder and to effect amendments to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility immediately prior
to, and conditional on, the Closing such that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not constitute or result
in a breach, default, event of default or other similar event or circumstance thereunder (whether as a result of a change of control or
otherwise); provided, however, that the Company and its Subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
may be required to enter into such amendment prior to the Closing, it being understood that the Closing shall be a condition to the
effectiveness of such amendment. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and shall instruct its and their
respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Revolver Amendment. Parent shall draft documentation associated with the Revolver Amendment and shall provide the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Revolver Amendment and any documentation related
thereto reasonably in advance of delivery and, after consultation with the Company with respect to any such comments, to accept
any such comments that are not unreasonable.

        (f)    The Company hereby consents to the reasonable and customary use of its and its Subsidiaries' trademarks, service marks
and logos in connection with the Financing; provided that such trademarks, service marks and logos are used in a manner that (1) is
consistent with the manner in which the Company has used its trademarks, service marks and logos in connection with past
financings and (2) is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries (it being
understood that any such use of such trademarks, service marks and logos shall fall within fair use principles under Applicable
Law and nothing herein shall be construed as a trademark license in respect of such use).

        (g)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05, until the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives shall:

Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the Redemption or Satisfaction and Discharge or any Debt Tender Offers;

         (ii)  be required to enter into any definitive agreement (other than the supplemental indentures, amendments, and
redemption documents described above as to be entered into prior to the Closing) or have any liability or any obligation
under any certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document

        (h)   Parent shall (i) promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys', accountants, consultants, agents, investment banks and other
representative's costs and fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with their respective obligations
pursuant to, and in accordance with, this Section 6.05, and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against all damages, losses, liabilities or reasonable costs and reasonable expenses
suffered or reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the
Satisfaction and Discharge, any Debt Tender Offers, any information used in connection therewith (other than information
provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.05, except to the extent such damages, losses, costs, Liabilities or
expenses are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of or resulted
from the material breach of this Section 6.05 by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or willful misconduct of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Company shall promptly
repay to Parent any amounts reimbursed or indemnified by Parent in favor of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives if it is finally determined as aforesaid that the Company would not be entitled to indemnification for such amounts
pursuant to this sentence.

        (i)    Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that neither the obtaining nor the consummation of any of the
Financing, the Revolver Amendment or any Debt Tender Offer is a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any of
the Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the Redemption or Satisfaction and Discharge or any Debt Tender Offer has not been
obtained or consummated prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall continue to be obligated, subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (including Section 9.02(b) with respect to the Company not having
breached or failed to perform in all material respects any of its obligations under clauses (a)-(h) of this Section 6.05), to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions to occur at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement (it being understood
that nothing in this Section 6.05(i) shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any breach by the Company of any of the covenants
in this Section 6.05 or the conditions set forth in Section 9.02(b)).

        Section 6.06    Director Resignations.     Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent
written resignations executed by each director of the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall
be effective at the Effective Time and which resignations shall not have been revoked.

        Section 6.07    Takeover Laws.     If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company's Board of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to grant such

Effective Time, take any action that is intended to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing; provided, that this Section 7.01 shall not limit or restrict Parent from exercising any of its rights under this Agreement.

        Section 7.02    Obligations of Merger Subsidiary.     

        (a)   Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to

        (b)   In the event that this Agreement has not been adopted by the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary at the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable after such execution and delivery, Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger
Subsidiary, shall take action by written consent to adopt this Agreement.

        Section 7.03    Voting of Shares.     Parent shall vote all shares of Company Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in
favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

        Section 7.04    Director and Officer Liability.     Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees to, do the following:

        (a)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable
Law and provided under the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any
threatened or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a "Proceeding") to which an Indemnified Person is a party or with respect to which an
Indemnified Person is otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining in whole or in
part to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company as such for another enterprise (including any Proceeding arising out
of or pertaining to matters occurring or existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to

reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements whether or not Parent elects to control the defense of any relevant Proceeding)
incurred by each Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Proceedings, such fees, costs and
expenses (including such reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) to be advanced within ten Business Days of receipt by
Parent from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides a
written undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not entitled to indemnification and (y) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In
the event any claim for indemnification is asserted or made by any Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 7.04, any
determination required to be made with respect to whether such Indemnified Person's conduct complies with the standards under
Delaware Law and other Applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws shall be made by an
appropriate court or tribunal (it being understood and agreed that the burden of proof shall be on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to establish that such Indemnified Person did not so comply). In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Person and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any
such Proceeding, and (iii) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written
consent.

        (b)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving
Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving
Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of expenses
that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this
Agreement.

        (c)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
and comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person, and not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would adversely affect any right of any Indemnified Person
thereunder.

        (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extended reporting or
discovery period for the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, "D&O Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or
alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby);
provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such "tail" insurance of more
than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, which amount
is set forth in Section 7.04(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (the

of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the
Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
the Maximum Amount; and provided, further, that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

        (e)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Person is a party to or is otherwise involved
(including as a witness) in any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 7.04 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

        (f)    If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

        (g)   The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

        Section 7.05    Employee Matters.     

        (a)   Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, provide to each Company
Employee who is employed immediately prior to the Closing and who remains in the employ of Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing (each such individual, a "Continuing Employee") (i) for a period of 24 months following the
Closing Date, a base salary or wage rate and annual target bonus opportunity that are no less favorable than the base salary or wage
rate and annual target bonus opportunity pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan or Sales Incentive Plan, as applicable to
which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) for a period of 12 months following the
Closing Date, with employee benefits (excluding other short term and long term cash or equity incentives) that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

        (b)   For a period of 24 months following the Closing, Parent shall maintain the employee severance protections set forth in
Section 7.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

        (c)   Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, use reasonable best efforts to

Continuing Employees following the Closing (collectively, the "Parent Plans") to (i) recognize the pre-Closing service of

participating Continuing Employees with the Company for all purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (other than
for benefit accrual purposes under defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical plans), except to the extent such service credit
would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition limitations for participating
Continuing Employees to the same extent waived under analogous Company Employee Plans and (iii) provide credit to each
participating Continuing Employee under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid by the Continuing Employee prior to the
Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs under any analogous Company Employee Plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms of such Parent Plan.

        (d)   Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to credit under any applicable Parent Plans each
Continuing Employee for all vacation and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to use but has not used
as of the Closing to the extent reflected in the books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise disclosed to
Parent.

        (e)   Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the Company's
2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to, (i) ensure that no offering period, except for the offering period in effect
under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement and any offering period that commences prior to January 1, 2017 under the terms of
the ESPP as in effect as of the date hereof, shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement and
(ii) contingent on the Effective Time, with respect to the offering period, if any, in effect under the ESPP that is scheduled to end
on or after the Closing Date, establish a date (which date shall be not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date) as the
final purchase date under the ESPP. The Company shall cause the amount credited to each participant's account under the ESPP on
such final purchase date to be applied to purchase the number of shares of Company Stock that could be purchased with such
amount on such date pursuant to the ESPP. The Company shall terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Effective Time,
contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, in
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 7.05(e).

        (f)    With respect to the performance period in effect under the Company's Management Incentive Plan and Sales Incentive
Plan as of the Closing Date, the Company shall pay to each participant in each such plan (on or as soon as practicable after the

have been made for such participant under such Savings Plan for such year, based on performance achieved through the Closing
Date, as determined by the Company. In addition, if the Closing Date occurs after the end of a calendar year and prior to the date
on which profit sharing contributions for such calendar year are made to a Savings Plan, Parent shall make a profit sharing
contribution to the account of each participant in such Savings Plan as soon as practicable following the completion of the
Company's audited consolidated financial statements for such calendar year in an amount determined based on the achievement of
the applicable performance goals. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent on the occurrence of the
Closing, the Company shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) all Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and include a cash or deferred arrangement (a "Company 401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides
written notice to the Company no later than 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Time that any such Company 401(k) Plan shall
not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, and in no event later than three Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent on the Closing) pursuant to resolutions
of the Company's Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to reasonable review by Parent.
In the event of such termination, Parent agrees to cause a 401(k) plan sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries to accept a
"direct rollover" from such Company 401(k) Plan of the account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans) of all Continuing Employees if such rollover is elected in accordance with Applicable Law by a Continuing Employee. The
parties shall cooperate to take whatever actions are necessary to permit each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who has an
outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k) Plan on the date the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated to continue to make
loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan pending the distribution and rollover of his or her account, as described in the previous
sentence.

        (h)   The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, comply with any required notice to, or
engage in any required consultation with, any labor union, works council or other labor organization, pursuant to any Collective
Bargaining Agreement to which any of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound, or pursuant to Applicable Law. The
parties agree to work together in good faith to consult with or obtain the consent of any labor or trade union, works council or other
employee representative body as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, following the Effective Time, the terms and conditions of employment for any
Continuing Employee whose employment is subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by such Collective
Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

        (j)    Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06(a), nothing in this Section 7.05, express or implied, (i) is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto, including any Continuing Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or
modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or
(iv) shall create any obligation on the part of Parent or its subsidiaries (or, following Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to employ or engage any individual, including any Continuing Employee, for any period following the Closing Date.]

its terms).

        (c)   In the event that all or any portion of the Credit Agreement becomes unavailable to consummate the Financing, other
than as a result of receipt of proceeds from other Financings or asset sales (to the extent such proceeds, cash equivalents or other
short term liquid investments remain on Parent's balance sheet), (i) Parent shall promptly notify the Company, and (ii) if Parent
will not otherwise have access to funds in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and for Parent to pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and/or its Affiliates, shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable but
no later than prior to the End Date, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, or
customary to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and obtain definitive commitments with respect to, alternative financing from the
same or alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") (i) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and for Parent to pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Alternative Financing and (ii) that would not impose new or additional
conditions precedent to funding such Alternative Financing that are more restrictive in any material respects than those contained
in the Credit Agreement.

or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement (and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting), the Company
enters into such binding definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and (3) the Company
immediately prior to such termination pays to Parent in immediately available funds the fee required to be paid pursuant to
Section 11.04(b)(i); provided, that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01(d)(i) with respect to any Superior Proposal unless the Company has complied with each of the requirements
of Section 6.04 (including Section 6.04(e)) that the Company is required to satisfy before taking action pursuant to this
Section 10.01(d)(i) and has not otherwise materially and willfully breached any covenant or agreement set forth in
Section 6.04; or

         (ii)  a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent
or Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that (x) is incapable of being cured prior to the End
Date or (y) otherwise, shall not have been cured (if curable) by the earlier of 30 calendar days after delivery of notice of
such breach in writing and the End Date and, in each case, that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 9.03(a) or
Section 9.03(b) not to be satisfied.

        The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01 (other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give

Subsidiary) shall be relieved or released from Liability for (1) willful and material breach of this Agreement, including any willful and
material breach by Parent of Section 7.06 which has the effect of causing the Financing not to be consummated, or (2) fraud, and in the
case of each of (1) and (2), the party agrees that the party that so breaches or acts with fraud shall be fully liable for any and all Liabilities
and damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include, to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by a party or its stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,

Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost, expense or Tax.

        (b)    Termination Fee.    

          (i)  If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(c)(iii) or by the
Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds
$75,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall be payable (A) in the case of a termination by Parent,
within three Business Days after such termination and (B), in the case of a termination by the Company, immediately
before and as a condition to such termination.

         (ii)  If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) before the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained or Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed or announced after the date of this Agreement and not publicly withdrawn (x) with respect to a termination
pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i), prior to such termination and (y) with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b)
(iii), at least five Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (C) within twelve (12) months following
the date of such termination, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this
clause (C), each reference to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"),
then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable
event described in this clause (C), the Termination Fee.

        (c)   Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that, subject to Section 10.02, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 11.04 and such Termination Fee is
paid in full, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or
otherwise, and neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (d)   The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 11.04 do not constitute a penalty; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 11.04 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as applicable,
commences an Action that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount due pursuant to this Section 11.04, the
Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Subsidiary its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection
with such Action, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the latest U.S. prime rate as published
in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the
relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is reasonably apparent.
The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

        Section 11.06    Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.     

        (a)   The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, other
than: (i) with respect to the provisions of Section 7.04 which shall inure to the benefit of the persons or entities benefiting
therefrom who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
shares of Company Stock to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
(iii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Equity Awards to receive the payments contemplated by
the applicable provisions of Section 2.04, in each case, at the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (iv) prior to the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Common Stock to pursue claims for damages and other
relief, including equitable relief, for Parent's or Merger Subsidiary's breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that the rights
granted to the holders of Common Stock pursuant to the foregoing clause (iv) of this Section 11.06(a) shall only be enforceable on
behalf of such holders by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion and (v) the Financing Source Related Parties (who shall
be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, this Section 11.06(a)(v) and Section 10.02, 11.03(c), 11.08(c), 11.09 and
11.13(e)). The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto.

        (b)   No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of each other party hereto, except that each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all
of its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to Parent (in the case of Merger Subsidiary) or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (in the case of Parent or Merger Subsidiary); provided, that no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any liability; provided, further, that, without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no such assignment shall be made to the extent the assignment
would be reasonably likely to give rise to additional withholding Tax obligations with respect to any payments made under this
Agreement.

        Section 11.07    Governing Law.     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of

such) shall not have any Liability to the Company or any of its equity holders, Representatives or Affiliates (in each case, with
respect to such equity holders, Representatives or Affiliates, prior to the Closing of the Merger) relating to or arising out of this

punitive damages, against any Financing Source Related Party (in its capacity as such) under this Agreement or the Financing,

Annex B 

September 25, 2016

Board of Directors
Chemtura Corporation
199 Benson Road
Middlebury, CT 06762

Members of the Board:

        We understand that Chemtura Corporation (the "Company"), Lanxess Deutschland GmbH ("Parent") and Lanxess Additives Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of
the draft dated September 25, 2016 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of
Merger Sub with and into the Company. We understand that Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess AG (the "Buyer"). Pursuant
to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than shares held in treasury or owned by Parent or any subsidiary
of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, or shares as to which dissenters' rights have been
perfected, will be converted into the right to receive $33.50 per share in cash (the "Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the
Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company and
the Buyer, respectively; 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company; 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company; 

4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives
of the Company; 

5) Reviewed the pro forma impact of the Merger on the Buyer's earnings per share, cash flow, consolidated capitalization and
certain financial ratios; 

6) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock and the common stock of the Buyer; 

7) Compared the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded
companies comparable with the Company and their securities; 

8) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

9) Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and their financial and
legal advisors;

10) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft bridge loan facility agreement (the "Bridge Loan Facility Agreement") from
certain lenders substantially in the form of the draft dated September 24, 2016 and certain related documents; and 

11) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed
appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was
publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With
respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgment of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we
have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,
amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Buyer will obtain financing in accordance with the
terms set forth in the Bridge Loan Facility Agreement and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect
from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be
imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not
legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of
the Buyer and the Company and their legal, tax, or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no
opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company's officers, directors or employees,
or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the
transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as
in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion
and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee
for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we
have provided financial advisory and financing services for the Company and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan
Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and its affiliates, including the Company, in the
future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

        Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign
exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial
advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that
invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account
or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Buyer, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or
commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.

        This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with
our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other
purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the
company is required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is
required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanly expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the
Company should vote at the stockholders' meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.

        Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares
of the Company Common Stock.

Annex C: SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL 

§ 262 Appraisal Rights 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)
(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository
receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a.
and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the
words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving
or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice
a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the
vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if
it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the
sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second
notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent
corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided,
that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If
no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from
the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given
by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the
costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the
right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery
shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.
