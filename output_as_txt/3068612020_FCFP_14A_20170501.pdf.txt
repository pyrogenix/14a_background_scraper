PROXY STATEMENT OF FIRST COMMUNITY FINANCIAL PARTNERS, INC.

Merger Proposal—Your Vote Is Important

DEAR FIRST COMMUNITY STOCKHOLDERS:

            The board of directors of First Community Financial Partners, Inc. (which we refer to as "First Community") and First Busey Corporation (which we refer to as "First Busey") have each unanimously approved a transaction
that will result in the merger of First Community with and into First Busey (which we refer to as the "merger"). First Busey will be the surviving bank holding company in the merger. If the merger is completed, First Community
stockholders will receive $1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of First Busey common stock (which we refer to as the "exchange ratio") for each of their First Community shares, subject to certain adjustments as described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. After the merger is completed, we expect that current First Busey stockholders will own approximately 84.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company, and current First
Community stockholders will own approximately 15.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company.

            First Busey's common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "BUSE." First Community's common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "FCFP."
Based on the five-day weighted average closing price of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of $29.31 as of February 3, 2017, the trading day immediately preceding the public
announcement date of the merger, the implied merger consideration that a First Community stockholder would be entitled to receive for each share of First Community common stock owned would be $12.95 with an aggregate
transaction value of approximately $235.8 million. Based on the five-day weighted average closing price of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of $28.37 as of April 17, 2017, the latest
practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the implied merger consideration that a First Community stockholder would be entitled to receive for each share of First Community common stock owned would
be $12.58 with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $232.0 million.

            Among other termination rights described in this proxy statement/prospectus, First Community is entitled to terminate the merger agreement if the weighted average daily closing sales price (which we refer to as the "First
Busey Market Value") of a share of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days prior to the first date on which all regulatory approvals (and waivers, if
applicable) required for completion of the merger are received (disregarding any waiting periods) (which we refer to as the "Determination Date") is less than $22.71 per share, unless First Busey elects to increase the exchange ratio
to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $8.99 by the First Busey Market Value. If First Busey elects to increase the exchange ratio, the merger agreement will remain in effect in accordance with its terms, except the stock
consideration will be increased to reflect the revised exchange ratio. If First Busey declines to increase the exchange ratio, First Community will have the option to accept the original exchange ratio without adjustment. If the First
Busey Market Value on the Determination Date is more than $35.90, then the exchange ratio shall be decreased to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $14.22 by the First Busey Market Value. If an adjustment to the exchange
ratio would require First Busey to issue more than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of into First Busey common stock at the effective time, then First Busey shall have the right to adjust the exchange ratio so that First
Busey would only be required to issue no more than 19.9% of the First Busey common stock, and First Busey shall increase the cash consideration to reflect, on a per share basis, the aggregate value of the total number of shares that
otherwise would have been issuable, valued at the First Busey Market Value.

            We cannot complete the merger unless we obtain the necessary governmental approvals and unless the stockholders of First Community approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. Your vote is
important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please take the time to vote by following the voting instructions included in the enclosed proxy card. Submitting a
proxy now will not prevent you from being able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you do not vote your shares as instructed in the enclosed proxy card, or if you do not instruct your broker, bank or other fiduciary how to
vote any shares held for you in "street name," the effect will be a vote against the merger and the transactions contemplated therein.

            The date, time and place of the stockholders' meeting follow:

            This proxy statement/prospectus contains a more complete description of the special meeting of First Community stockholders and the terms of the merger. We urge you to review this entire document carefully. You may also
obtain information about First Community and First Busey from documents that each has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the "SEC").

            First Community's board of directors recommends that First Community's stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein and "FOR" the other matters
to be considered at the special meeting.

            You should read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully because it contains important information about the merger. In particular, you should read carefully the information under the section entitled "Risk
Factors" beginning on page 26.

            Neither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory body has approved or disapproved of the securities to be issued under this proxy statement/prospectus or determined if this proxy statement/prospectus is
truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

            The securities to be issued in connection with the merger are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank or nonbank subsidiary of any of the parties, and they are not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.

            This proxy statement/prospectus is dated April 25, 2017, and is first being mailed to First Community's stockholders on or about May 1, 2017.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the special meeting.
We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section may not provide all the information that might be
important to you in determining how to vote. Additional important information is also contained in the appendices to, and the documents incorporated by reference in, this
document. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

Q: What is the proposed transaction? 

A: You are being asked to vote on the approval of a merger agreement that provides for the merger of First Community Financial Partners, Inc. (which we refer to as "First
Community") with and into First Busey Corporation (which we refer to as "First Busey), with First Busey as the surviving company (which we refer to as the "merger
proposal"). The merger is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017. At a date following the completion of the merger, First Busey intends to merge First Community
Financial Bank, First Community's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, with and into Busey Bank, First Busey's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, with Busey Bank as the
surviving bank (which we refer to as the "bank merger"). At such time, First Community Financial Bank's banking offices will become banking offices of Busey Bank.
Until the banks are merged, First Busey will own and operate First Community Financial Bank and Busey Bank as separate bank subsidiaries. 

Q: What will First Community stockholders be entitled to receive in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, each share of First Community common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares
owned by First Community as treasury stock or otherwise owned by First Community or First Busey and any dissenting shares), will be converted into the right to receive
$1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of First Busey common shares (which we refer to as the "exchange ratio") pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain
adjustments as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Only whole shares of First Busey common stock will be issued in the merger. As a result, cash will be paid
instead of any fractional shares based on the reference price of First Busey common stock as more fully described on page 69. Shares of First Community common stock
held by First Community stockholders who elect to exercise their dissenters' rights will not be converted into merger consideration. 

Q: What is the value of the per share merger consideration? 

A: The value of the merger consideration to be received by First Community stockholders will fluctuate as the market price of First Busey common stock fluctuates before
the completion of the merger. This price will not be known at the time of the First Community special meeting and may be more or less than the current price of common
stock or the price of First Busey common stock at the time of the special meeting. 

Based on the five-day weighted average closing price of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of $29.31 as of February 3, 2017,
the trading day immediately preceding the public announcement date of the merger, the implied merger consideration that a First Community stockholder would be
entitled to receive for each share of First Community common stock owned would be $12.95 with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $235.8 million. Based
on the five-day weighted average closing price of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of $28.37 as of April 17, 2017, the latest
practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the implied merger consideration that a First Community stockholder would be entitled to receive for
each share of

Table of Contents

First Community common stock owned would be $12.58 with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $232.0 million.

We urge you to obtain current market quotations for shares of First Busey common stock and First Community common stock.

Q: Is the merger consideration subject to adjustment? 

A: Yes. First Community is entitled to terminate the merger agreement if the weighted average daily closing sales price (which we refer to as the "First Busey Market
Value") of a share of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days prior to the first date on which
all regulatory approvals (and waivers, if applicable) required for completion of the merger are received (disregarding any waiting periods) (which we refer to as the
"Determination Date") is less than $22.71 per share, unless First Busey elects to increase the exchange ratio to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $8.99 by the First
Busey Market Value. If First Busey elects to increase the exchange ratio, the merger agreement will remain in effect in accordance with its terms, except the stock
consideration will be increased to reflect the revised exchange ratio. If First Busey declines to increase the exchange ratio, First Community will have the option to accept
the original exchange ratio without adjustment. If the First Busey Market Value on the Determination Date is more than $35.90, then the exchange ratio shall be decreased
to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $14.22 by the First Busey Market Value. If an adjustment to the exchange ratio would require First Busey to issue more than
19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of into First Busey common stock at the effective time, then First Busey shall have the right to adjust the exchange ratio so
that First Busey would only be required to issue no more than 19.9% of the First Busey common stock, and First Busey shall increase the cash consideration to reflect, on
a per share basis, the aggregate value of the total number of shares that otherwise would have been issuable, valued at the First Busey Market Value. 

Q: Why do First Community and First Busey want to engage in the merger? 

A: First Community believes that the merger will provide First Community stockholders with substantial benefits, and First Busey believes that the merger will further its
strategic growth plans. To review the reasons for the merger in more detail, see "The Merger—First Community's reasons for the merger and recommendation of the
board of directors" and "The Merger—First Busey's reasons for the merger." 

Q: In addition to approving the merger agreement, what else are First Community stockholders being asked to vote on? 

A: In addition to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, First Community is soliciting proxies from holders of its common stock with respect to a
proposal to adjourn the First Community special meeting to permit further solicitation in the event that an insufficient number of votes are cast to approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated therein (which we refer to as the "adjournment proposal"). Completion of the merger is not conditioned upon approval of the
adjournment proposal. 

Q: What does the First Community board of directors recommend? 

A: First Community's board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein are in the best interests of First Community and
its stockholders. First Community's board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated therein and "FOR" the approval to adjourn the special meeting to permit further solicitation in the event that an

Table of Contents

insufficient number of votes are cast to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. To review the reasons for the merger in more detail, see
"The Merger—First Community's reasons for the merger and recommendation of the board of directors."

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the First Community special meeting, and how will abstentions and broker non-votes affect the vote? 

A: Approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of First
Community common stock entitled to vote. Abstentions, shares not voted and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal. Approval
of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of First Community common stock represented in person or by proxy at
the special meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions are deemed to be represented at the special meeting and thereby have the same effect as a vote against the
adjournment proposal. Shares not voted and broker non-votes will have no effect on the adjournment proposal, although they may prevent First Community from
obtaining a quorum and require First Community to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies. 

Q: Why is my vote important? 

A: The merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is approved by First Community stockholders. If you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the special
meeting, or vote to abstain, or you do not provide your broker, bank other fiduciary with voting instructions, as applicable, this will have the same effect as a vote against
the approval of the merger agreement. The First Community board of directors unanimously recommends that First Community's stockholders vote "FOR" the merger
proposal. Completion of the merger is not conditional upon approval of the adjournment proposal. 

Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote? 

A: If you are a First Community stockholder, you may vote at the special meeting if you own shares of First Community common stock of record at the close of business on
the record date for the special meeting, April 17, 2017. After you have carefully read and considered the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, please
vote by a method described on your proxy card. This will enable your shares to be represented at the special meeting. You may also vote in person at the special meeting.
If you do not vote by proxy and do not vote at the special meeting, this will make it more difficult to achieve a quorum for the meeting. 

Q: If my shares of common stock are held in "street name" by my broker, bank or other fiduciary, will my bank, broker or other fiduciary automatically vote my
shares for me? 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other fiduciary cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other
fiduciary, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the broker,
bank or other fiduciary. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to First Community, or by voting in person at the First Community
special meeting, unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other fiduciary. Further, brokers, banks or other fiduciaries who
hold shares of First Community common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to First Community to vote those shares with respect to any of the
proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other fiduciaries do not have discretionary voting power on these matters. Failure to
instruct your broker, bank other fiduciary how to vote will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Q: How will my proxy be voted? 

A: If you complete, sign, date and mail your proxy form, your proxy will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you sign, date and send in your proxy form, but
you do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be voted "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the other proposals in the notice. 

Q: Can I revoke my proxy and change my vote? 

A: You may change your vote or revoke your proxy prior to the special meeting by filing with the corporate secretary of First Community, a duly executed revocation of
proxy or submitting a new proxy with a later date. You may also revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the applicable special meeting. 

Q: Are there risks I should consider in deciding to vote on the approval of the merger agreement? 

A: Yes, in evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, you should read this proxy statement/prospectus carefully, including the factors
discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 26. 

Q: What if I oppose the merger? Do I have dissenters' rights? 

A: First Community stockholders who do not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement and otherwise comply with all of the procedures of the Illinois Business
Corporation Law of 1980, as amend (which we refer to as the "IBCA"), will be entitled to receive payment in cash of the fair value of their shares of First Community
common stock as ultimately determined under the statutory process. A copy of the applicable sections of the IBCA is attached as Appendix B to this document. This "fair
value" could be more than the merger consideration but could also be less. 

Q: What are the tax consequences of the merger to me? 

Each of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum & Nagelberg LLP (which we refer to as "Barack Ferrazzano") and Howard & Howard Attorneys PLLC (which we refer to as
"Howard & Howard") have delivered opinions, dated March 15, 2017, to the effect that the merger qualifies as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the "Internal Revenue Code"). In addition, the completion of the merger is conditioned on receipt of a
tax opinion from each of Barack Ferrazzano and Howard & Howard, dated as of the closing date, to the same effect as the opinions in the preceding sentence. The
opinion will not bind the Internal Revenue Service, which could take a different view. Neither First Busey nor First Community has requested or received a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service that the merger will qualify as a reorganization. Provided the merger qualifies as a reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes, First Community stockholders may recognize gain, but will not recognize loss, upon the exchange of their First Community common stock for shares of First
Busey common stock and cash. If the sum of the fair market value of the First Busey common stock and the amount of cash you receive in exchange for your shares of
First Community common stock exceeds the adjusted basis of your shares of First Community common stock, you will recognize taxable gain equal to the lesser of the
amount of such excess or the amount of cash you receive in the exchange. Generally, any gain recognized upon the exchange will be capital gain, and any such capital
gain will be long-term capital gain if you have established a holding period of more than one year for your shares of First Community common stock. Depending on
certain facts specific to you, any gain could instead be characterized as ordinary dividend income. You should consult with your tax adviser for the specific tax
consequences of the merger to you. See "The Merger—Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger."

Q: When and where is First Community special meeting? 

A: The First Community special meeting will take place on June 7, 2017, at 10:30 a.m. local time, at Chicago Marriott Southwest at Burr Ridge, 1200 Burr Ridge Parkway,
Burr Ridge, Illinois 60527. 

Q: Who may attend the First Community special meeting? 

A: Only First Community stockholders on the record date may attend the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you will need to present the proxy card that you
received or another proof of identification in order to be admitted into the meeting. 

Q: Should I send in my First Community stock certificates now? 

A: No. Either at the time of closing or shortly after the merger is completed, the exchange agent for the merger, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will send you a letter
of transmittal with instructions informing you how to send in your stock certificates to the exchange agent. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your First
Community stock certificates for the merger consideration. Do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy form. 

Q: Whom may I contact if I cannot locate my First Community stock certificate(s)? 

A: If you are unable to locate your original First Community stock certificate(s), you should contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, First Community's
transfer agent, at 1 (888) 509-4619, option 1, or First Community Financial Partners, Inc., Lynne M. Brooks, Shareholder Services, at (630) 789-4441. 

Q: What should I do if I hold my shares of First Community common stock in book-entry form? 

A: You are not required to take any special additional actions if your shares of First Community common stock are held in book-entry form. After the completion of the
merger, shares of First Community common stock held in book-entry form automatically will be exchanged for the merger consideration, plus cash in lieu of any
fractional shares. 

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: First Community stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards
or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold shares of First Community common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold such shares. If you are a holder of record of First Community common stock and your shares are registered
in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or
otherwise follow the voting instructions set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus to ensure that you vote every share of First Community common stock that you own. 

Q: When is the merger expected to be completed? 

A: We will try to complete the merger as soon as reasonably possible. Before that happens, the merger agreement must be approved by stockholders of First Community, and
we must obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Assuming First Community stockholders vote to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement and we obtain
the other necessary approvals and satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the closing described in the merger agreement, we expect to complete the merger in
mid-2017. See "Description of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to completion of the merger."

Q: Is completion of the merger subject to any conditions besides stockholder approval? 

A: Yes. The transaction must receive the required regulatory approvals, and there are other standard closing conditions that must be satisfied. See "Description of the Merger
Agreement—Conditions to completion of the merger." 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: First Community and First Busey expect to complete the merger in mid-2017. However, neither First Community nor First Busey can assure you of when or if the merger
will be completed. First Community and First Busey must first obtain the approval of First Community stockholders for the merger, as well as obtain necessary regulatory
approvals and satisfy certain other standard closing conditions. If the merger is not completed, First Community stockholders will not receive any consideration for their
shares and will continue to be First Community stockholders. Each of First Busey and First Community will remain independent companies. Under certain circumstances,
First Busey and First Community may be required to pay the other party a fee with respect to the termination of the merger agreement, as described under "Description of
the Merger Agreement—Termination fees." 

Q: Who can answer my other questions? 

A: If you have more questions about the merger or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy form,
you should contact: First Community Financial Partners, Inc., Glen Stiteley, Corporate Secretary, 2801 Black Road, Joliet, Illinois 60435, (815) 725-1885.

Busey intends to merge First Community Financial Bank with and into Busey Bank, with Busey Bank as the surviving bank. At such time, First Community Financial
Bank's banking offices will become banking offices of Busey Bank. Until the banks are merged, First Busey will own and operate First Community Financial Bank and
Busey Bank as separate bank subsidiaries.

        The merger agreement is included as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein. We urge you to read the merger
agreement carefully and fully, as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

What First Community stockholders will receive (See page 68)

        If the merger is completed, each share of First Community common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than
shares owned by First Community as treasury stock or otherwise owned by First Community or First Busey and any dissenting shares), will be converted into the right to
receive $1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of First Busey common shares pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain adjustments as described in this
proxy statement/prospectus. Only whole shares of First Busey common stock will be issued in the merger. As a result, cash will be paid instead of any fractional shares
based on the reference price of First Busey common stock as more fully described on page 69. Shares of First Community common stock held by First Community
stockholders who elect to exercise their dissenters' rights will not be converted into merger consideration.

Potential adjustment of merger consideration (See page 69)

        First Community is entitled to terminate the merger agreement if the First Busey Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $22.71 per share, unless First
Busey elects to increase the exchange ratio to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $8.99 by the First Busey Market Value. If First Busey elects to increase the exchange
ratio, the merger agreement will remain in effect in accordance with its terms, except the stock consideration will be increased to reflect the revised exchange ratio. If First
Busey declines to increase the exchange ratio, First Community will have the option to accept the original exchange ratio without adjustment. If the First Busey Market
Value on the Determination Date is more than $35.90, then the exchange ratio shall be decreased to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $14.22 by the First Busey
Market Value. If an adjustment to the exchange ratio would require First Busey to issue more than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of into First Busey common
stock at the effective time, then First Busey shall have the right to adjust the exchange ratio so that First Busey would only be required to issue no more than 19.9% of the
First Busey common stock, and First Busey shall increase the cash consideration to reflect, on a per share basis, the aggregate value of the total number of shares that
otherwise would have been issuable, valued at the First Busey Market Value.

Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger (See page 56)

        Each of Barack Ferrazzano and Howard & Howard have delivered opinions, dated March 15, 2017, to the effect that the merger qualifies as a "reorganization"
pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the completion of the merger is conditioned on receipt of a tax opinion from each of Barack
Ferrazzano and Howard & Howard, dated as of the closing date, to the same effect as the opinions in the preceding sentence. The opinion will not bind the Internal
Revenue Service, which could take a different view. Neither First Busey nor First Community has requested or received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the
merger will qualify as a reorganization.

        Provided the merger qualifies as a reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, First Community stockholders may recognize gain, but will not
recognize loss, upon the exchange of their First Community common stock for shares of First Busey common stock and cash. If the sum of

the fair market value of the First Busey common stock and the amount of cash you receive in exchange for your shares of First Community common stock exceeds the
adjusted basis of your shares of First Community common stock, you will recognize taxable gain equal to the lesser of the amount of such excess or the amount of cash
you receive in the exchange. Generally, any gain recognized upon the exchange will be capital gain, and any such capital gain will be long-term capital gain if you have
established a holding period of more than one year for your shares of First Community common stock. Depending on certain facts specific to you, any gain could instead
be characterized as ordinary dividend income.

        Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger to you as an individual taxpayer can be complicated. The tax treatment will depend on your specific situation
and many variables not within our control. For these reasons, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor concerning the federal and any applicable state, local or
other tax consequences of the merger to you.

First Community's reasons for the merger; Board recommendation to First Community's stockholders (See page 44)

        The First Community board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein are in the best interests of First Community and
its stockholders. First Community's board of directors unanimously recommends that First Community stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the merger
agreement and "FOR" adjournment of the First Community special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement.

Interests of officers and directors of First Community in the merger may be different from, or in addition to, yours (See page 60)

        When you consider the First Community board of directors' recommendation to vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of
First Community's directors and officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as stockholders. These interests include,
among others, retention and employment agreements with First Busey, the treatment of outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement, certain payments and
benefits payable under the employment agreement entered into with First Community's chief executive officer, and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance
coverage by the surviving corporation for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger. These interests also include First Busey's agreement to appoint (i) one member
of the First Community board of directors to serve as a member of the First Busey board of directors following completion of the merger and (ii) one individual mutually
agreeable to the parties to the Busey bank board of directors following the completion of the bank merger. The First Community board of directors was aware of these
interests and took them into account in reaching its decisions to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to recommend the approval of the merger agreement to First
Community stockholders.

Treatment of First Community stock options and other equity awards (see page 70)

        First Community Employee Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of First Community
common stock, whether vested or unvested, other than director stock options as discussed below, will be converted into an option to purchase First Busey common stock,
and will remain subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable immediately prior to the effective time, as provided further in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        First Community Director Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of First Community
common stock granted to a participant for

service as a past or current member of the board of directors or an advisory board of First Community or First Community Financial Bank, or its affiliates, whether vested
or unvested, will be cashed out by virtue of the merger as provided further in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        First Community Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit representing the right to receive one share of First
Community common stock will be cashed out by virtue of the merger as provided further in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        First Community Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding performance stock unit award representing the right to receive one
share of First Community common stock subject to a performance vesting condition will be deemed to be earned and vested at target level performance (defined as
"Stretch" level of performance in the actual award agreements) and will be cashed out by virtue of the merger.

First Community stockholders will have dissenters' rights in connection with the merger (See page 65)

        First Community stockholders may assert dissenters' rights in connection with the merger and, upon complying with the requirements of the IBCA, receive cash in the
amount of the fair value of their shares instead of the merger consideration.

        A copy of the sections of the IBCA pertaining to dissenters' rights is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus. You should read the statute carefully
and consult with your legal counsel if you intend to exercise these rights.

The merger and the performance of the combined company are subject to a number of risks (See page 26)

        There are a number of risks relating to the merger and to the businesses of First Busey, First Community and the combined company following the merger. See the
"Risk Factors" beginning on page 26 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of these and other risks relating to the merger. You should also consider the other
information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Stockholder approval will be required to complete the merger and approve the other proposals set forth in the notice (See page 34)

        Approval by First Community's stockholders at First Community's special meeting of stockholders on June 7, 2017 is required to complete the merger. The presence,
in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of First Community common stock entitled to vote on the merger agreement is necessary to constitute a quorum at the
meeting. Each share of First Community common stock outstanding on the record date entitles its holder to one vote on the merger agreement and any other proposal listed
in the notice. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of First Community common stock
entitled to vote. Abstentions, shares not voted and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal. Approval of the adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of First Community common stock represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled
to vote. Abstentions are deemed to be represented at the special meeting and thereby have the same effect as a vote against the adjournment proposal. Shares not voted and
broker non-votes will have no effect on the adjournment proposal, although they may prevent First Community from obtaining a quorum and require First Community to
adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional proxies.

Completion of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals (See page 60)

        The merger cannot proceed without obtaining all requisite regulatory approvals. First Busey and First Community have agreed to take all appropriate actions
necessary to obtain the required approvals. The merger of First Busey and First Community is subject to prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (which we refer to as the "Federal Reserve"). First Busey submitted an application with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on February 27, 2017 seeking the
necessary approvals. The merger may not be completed until 15 days after receipt of Federal Reserve approval, during which time the United States Department of Justice
may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds. The commencement of an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's approval, unless a court
specifically orders otherwise.

        At a date following the completion of the merger, First Busey intends to merge First Community Financial Bank with and into Busey Bank, with Busey Bank as the
surviving bank. The bank merger will be subject to approval by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (which we refer to as the "IDFPR").
Busey Bank intends to file an application with the IDFPR seeking this approval in the near future.

        While First Busey knows of no reason why the approval of any of the applications would be denied or unduly delayed, it cannot assure you that all regulatory
approvals required to complete the merger and the bank merger will be obtained or obtained in a timely manner.

How the merger agreement may be terminated by First Busey and First Community (See page 78)

        First Busey and First Community may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time. Subject to conditions and
circumstances described in the merger agreement, either First Busey or First Community may also terminate the merger agreement as follows:

• the other party has breached or failed to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in the failure
of any of the closing conditions and such breach or failure cannot be cured within 30 days, provided its inability to satisfy the condition was not caused by
the non-breaching party's failure to comply in all material respects with any of its obligations under the merger agreement; 

• any regulatory authority has denied approval of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any application for a necessary regulatory
approval has been withdrawn at the request of a regulatory authority, provided that such right to terminate is not available to a party whose failure to fulfill
any of its obligations under the merger agreement has been the cause of the denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval; 

• failure to receive approval by First Community stockholders for the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein following the meeting held
for such purpose, provided that such right to terminate is not available to a party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations under the merger agreement
has been the cause of such failure; 

• the merger is not completed by October 31, 2017, provided that such right to terminate is not available to a party whose failure to fulfill any of its
obligations under the merger agreement has resulted in the failure of the merger to be completed before such date; or 

• a court or regulatory authority has enjoined or prohibited any of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement.

        In addition, a particular party may terminate the merger agreement as follows:

• First Busey may terminate if First Community materially breaches any of its obligations with respect to soliciting alternative acquisition proposals or
holding a meeting of its stockholders to approve the merger agreement; 

• First Community may terminate in order to enter into an agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal from a third party; 

• First Busey may terminate if First Community's board of directors makes an adverse recommendation to First Community's stockholders; or 

• First Community may terminate if (i) on the Determination Date the First Busey Market Value is less than $22.71; (ii) First Busey has not exercised its
option pursuant to increase the exchange ratio, and (iii) the First Community has not exercised its option to accept the exchange ratio without adjustment,
such termination to be effective on the tenth day following the Determination Date.

Termination fees and expenses may be payable under some circumstances (See page 79)

Termination Fees Payable by First Community.

        First Community has agreed to pay First Busey a termination fee of $2.5 million if First Busey terminates the merger agreement because First Community has
breached or failed to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in the failure of any of the closing conditions and
such breach or failure cannot be cured within 30 days, provided its inability to satisfy the condition was not caused by First Busey's failure to comply in all material
respects with any of its obligations under the merger agreement.

        First Community has agreed to pay First Busey a termination fee of $9.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated under the following circumstances:

• First Busey terminates the merger agreement because First Community breaches its covenant not to solicit an acquisition proposal from a third party or its
obligations related to holding a stockholder meeting to approve the merger agreement; 

• First Community terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal; or 

• If, prior to termination, another acquisition proposal is known to First Community, has been made directly to First Community's stockholders or is
publically announced, and (i) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated by First Busey upon First Community's material breach of its obligations under
the merger agreement and (ii) within six months after such termination First Community enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to such
acquisition proposal.

Termination Fees Payable by First Busey.

        First Busey has agreed to pay First Community a termination fee of $2.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated under the following circumstances:

• First Community terminates the merger agreement because First Busey has breached or failed to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, which
breach or failure to perform would result in the failure of any of the closing conditions and such breach or failure cannot be cured within 30 days, provided
its inability to satisfy the condition was not caused by First Community's failure to comply in all material respects with any of its obligations under the
merger agreement; or 

• First Community terminates the merger agreement because First Busey has elected to not increase the exchange ratio if the First Busey Market Value on the
Determination Date is less than $22.71.

Voting and support agreement (See page 69)

        On February 6, 2017, certain of the directors of First Community agreed to vote all of their shares of First Community common stock in favor of the merger
agreement at the special meeting. The voting and support agreement covers approximately 24.1% of First Community's outstanding shares of common stock as of
April 17, 2017. This voting and support agreement terminates if the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. A copy of the form of voting and support
agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix C.

Accounting treatment of the merger (See page 56)

        For accounting and financial reporting purposes, the merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as "GAAP").

Certain differences in First Busey stockholder rights and First Community stockholder rights (See page 87)

        Because they will receive First Busey common stock, First Community stockholders will become First Busey stockholders as a result of the merger. Their rights as
stockholders after the merger will be governed by First Busey's articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights of First Busey stockholders are different in certain respects
from the rights of First Community's stockholders. The material differences are described later in this proxy statement/prospectus.

First Busey shares will be listed on NASDAQ (See page 80)

        The shares of First Busey common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "BUSE."

Recent Developments (See page 25)

        On March 13, 2017, First Busey entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Mid Illinois Bancorp, Inc. (which we refer to as "Mid Illinois"), pursuant to
which First Busey will acquire Mid Illinois and its wholly owned subsidiary bank, South Side Trust & Savings Bank of Peoria (which we refer to as "South Side Bank").
In the proposed merger, Mid Illinois stockholders will have the right to receive for each share of Mid Illinois common stock, at the election of each stockholder, and
subject to proration, (i) $227.94 in cash, (ii) 7.5149 shares of First Busey common stock, or (iii) mixed consideration of $68.38 in cash and 5.2604 shares of First Busey
common stock, with total consideration to consist of 70% stock and 30% cash. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of
regulators and Mid Illinois stockholders, and is expected to close in the second half of 2017.

        First Busey is pursuing the First Community and Mid Illinois mergers independently of one another. The completion of the Mid Illinois merger is not contingent on
the completion of the First Community merger. Similarly, the completion of the First Community merger is not contingent on the completion of the Mid Illinois merger.

Risk Factors (See page 26)

        You should consider all the information contained or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in deciding how to vote for the proposals
presented. In particular, you should consider the factors described under "Risk Factors."

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

        The following table shows unaudited pro forma financial information about the financial condition and results of operations, including per share data, after giving
effect to the merger and other pro forma adjustments. The unaudited pro forma financial information assumes that the merger is accounted for under the acquisition
method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP, and that the assets and liabilities of First Community will be recorded by First Busey at their
respective fair values as of the date the merger is completed. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if the merger had
occurred on December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 gives effect to the merger as if
the merger had become effective at January 1, 2016. The unaudited selected pro forma combined financial information has been derived from and should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of First Busey, which are incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference, the
consolidated financial statements and related notes of First Community, which are incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference, and the more detailed
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can
Find More Information" and "Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information." The unaudited selected pro forma combined financial
information does not give effect to the announced acquisition by First Busey of Mid Illinois. See "Recent Developments."

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not indicate the financial results of the
combined company had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of each period presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information also does not consider any expense efficiencies, increased revenue or other potential financial benefits of the merger. In addition, the preliminary allocation of
the pro forma purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary significantly from the
actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded upon completion of the merger.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER COMMON SHARE DATA 

        We have summarized below the per share information for our companies on a historical, pro forma combined and equivalent basis. This information was derived from
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 for First Busey, and from the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 for First Community, which should be read in conjunction with this information. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

        The pro forma combined information gives effect to the merger accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance
with GAAP. The pro forma calculations reflect that each outstanding share of First Community common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive $1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of First Busey common stock.

        We assume that the merger occurred as of the beginning of the fiscal year or period presented (or in the case of book value, as of the date specified). The information
is presented for illustrative purposes only. You should not rely on the pro forma information as being indicative of the historical results that we would have had if we had
been combined or the future results that we will experience after the merger. The pro forma information, although helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the
combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings, opportunities to earn additional revenue, the impact of
restructuring and merger-related costs, or other factors that may result as a consequence of the merger and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future
results.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

        On March 13, 2017, First Busey entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Mid Illinois, pursuant to which First Busey will acquire Mid Illinois and its
wholly owned subsidiary bank, South Side Bank. In the proposed merger, Mid Illinois stockholders will have the right to receive for each share of Mid Illinois common
stock, at the election of each stockholder, and subject to proration, (i) $227.94 in cash, (ii) 7.5149 shares of First Busey common stock, or (iii) mixed consideration of
$68.38 in cash and 5.2604 shares of First Busey common stock, with total consideration to consist of 70% stock and 30% cash. The acquisition is subject to customary
closing conditions, including the approval of regulators and Mid Illinois stockholders, and is expected to close in the second half of 2017.

        The acquisition will enhance Busey's existing deposit, commercial banking and trust and investment presence in the greater Peoria area. Founded in 1922 and with
more than $665 million in bank assets and $575 million in trust assets as of December 31, 2016, South Side Bank operates as a state chartered commercial and trust bank
with thirteen branches located within the greater Peoria area. Upon completion of the holding company merger, South Side Bank is anticipated to merge with and into
Busey Bank in the first quarter of 2018.

        First Busey is pursuing the First Community and Mid Illinois mergers independently of one another. The completion of the Mid Illinois merger is not contingent on
the completion of the First Community merger. Similarly, the completion of the First Community merger is not contingent on the completion of the Mid Illinois merger.

        Additional information on First Busey's proposed acquisition of Mid Illinois may be found in First Busey's reports filed with the SEC, including the Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on March 13, 2017. First Busey will also file a registration statement on Form S-4, which will include a proxy statement of Mid Illinois, which will be
mailed to Mid Illinois stockholders describing the proposed acquisition of Mid Illinois and containing other important information. See "Where You Can Find More
Information."

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters
addressed under the section "Special Notes Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding how to vote for the
proposals presented in this proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See "References to Additional Information" in the forepart of this proxy statement/prospectus and the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Because the Market Price of First Busey Common Shares Will Fluctuate, First Community Stockholders Cannot Be Sure of the Value of the Merger Consideration They
Will Receive.

        Upon completion of the merger, each share of First Community common stock will be converted into the right to receive $1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of First Busey
common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain adjustments as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The market value of the merger
consideration may vary from the closing price of First Busey common stock on the date the merger was announced, on the date that this document was mailed to First
Community stockholders, on the date of the special meeting of the First Community stockholders and on the date the merger is completed and thereafter. Any change in the
exchange ratio or the market price of First Busey common stock prior to completion of the merger will affect the amount of and the market value of the merger consideration that
First Community stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting, First Community stockholders will not know or be
able to calculate with certainty the amount or the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the merger. Stock price changes may result
from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in business, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors
are beyond First Busey's or First Community's control. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of First Busey common stock and for shares of First Community
common stock before you vote and before you make your election.

The Market Price of First Busey Common Stock after the Merger May be Affected by Factors Different from Those Affecting the Shares of First Community or First Busey
Currently.

        Upon completion of the merger, holders of First Community common stock will become holders of First Busey common stock. First Busey's business differs in important
respects from that of First Community and they currently operate in different markets. Accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of
First Busey common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of
First Busey and First Community. For a discussion of the businesses and markets of First Busey and First Community and of some important factors to consider in connection
with those businesses, please see the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under "Where You Can Find More Information."

First Community Stockholders Will Have a Reduced Ownership and Voting Interest After the Merger and Will Exercise Less Influence Over Management.

        First Community stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the First Community board of directors and on other matters requiring stockholder approval
under Illinois law and First Community's articles of incorporation and bylaws. Upon the completion of the merger, each First Community stockholder will become a stockholder
of First Busey with a percentage ownership of First Busey that is smaller than such stockholder's percentage ownership of First Community.

Table of Contents

Additionally, only one member of the First Busey board of directors after the completion of the merger will be designated by First Community upon the completion of the
merger. Based on the number of issued and outstanding First Busey common shares and shares of First Community common stock on April 17, 2017, and based on the exchange
ratio of 0.396, stockholders of First Community, as a group, will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 15.5% of First Busey common shares expected to be
outstanding immediately after the merger (without giving effect to any First Busey common shares held by First Community stockholders prior to the merger). In addition, on
March 13, 2017, First Busey announced that it entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Mid Illinois. As part of the merger consideration for that transaction,
First Busey will issue shares of its common stock to Mid Illinois's stockholders such that, in the aggregate, 70% of the outstanding shares of Mid Illinois will be converted into
the right to receive shares of First Busey common stock and the remaining 30% of the outstanding shares will be converted into the right to receive cash. See "Recent
Developments." The issuance of First Busey shares in the Mid Illinois transaction will be further dilutive to First Community stockholders. Because of this, current First
Community stockholders, as a group, will have less influence on the board of directors, management and policies of First Busey (as the combined company following the merger)
than they now have on the board of directors, management and policies of First Community.

First Busey May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Merger.

        First Busey and First Community have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including
anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, First Busey's ability to combine the businesses of First Busey and First Community in a manner that
permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not
materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of First Busey or First Community nor result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers. If First Busey is not able
to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve
these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse
effect on the surviving corporation's business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

        Certain employees may not be employed by First Busey after the merger. In addition, employees that First Busey wishes to retain may elect to terminate their employment
as a result of the merger, which could delay or disrupt the integration process. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of First Busey's or First
Community's ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of First Busey or First Community to
maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger.

        Among the factors considered by the Boards of Directors of First Busey and First Community in connection with their respective approvals of the merger agreement were
the benefits that could result from the merger. There can be no assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or at all.

Regulatory Approvals May Not Be Received, May Take Longer than Expected or May Impose Conditions that Are Not Presently Anticipated or Cannot Be Met.

        Before the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement can be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the bank regulatory and other governmental
authorities. In deciding whether to grant regulatory clearances, the relevant governmental entities will consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each of
the parties. An adverse development in either

Table of Contents

party's regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain one or more of the required regulatory approvals or delay their receipt. The terms and conditions
of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company's business. First Busey and First
Community believe that the merger should not raise significant regulatory concerns and that First Busey will be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely
manner. Despite the parties' commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities, under the terms of the merger agreement,
First Busey and First Community will not be required to complete the merger if any such approvals would reasonably be expected to materially restrict or burden First Busey
following the merger. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or
restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of the merger, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company
following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were completed successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, neither
First Busey nor First Community can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger.
Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that
would prohibit or make illegal the completion of the merger.

The Merger Agreement May Be Terminated in Accordance with Its Terms and the Merger May Not Be Completed.

        The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: approval of the merger
agreement and the transactions it contemplates by First Community stockholders, receipt of certain requisite regulatory approvals, absence of orders prohibiting completion of
the merger, effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, approval of the issuance of First Busey common stock, as applicable, for
listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger
agreement) and the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements, and the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels. These
conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually
decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after stockholder approval, or First Busey or First Community may elect to terminate the merger agreement in
certain other circumstances.

Termination of the Merger Agreement Could Negatively Impact First Community.

        If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of First Community stockholders declining to approve the merger agreement, the ongoing business of
First Community may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger, First Community would be subject to a number of
risks, including the following:

• First Community may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price (including to the extent that the
current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed); 

• First Community may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees; 

• First Community will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed; 

• the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of First Community's businesses prior to completion of the merger. Such restrictions, the waiver of
which is subject to the

Table of Contents

consent of First Busey (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent First Community from making certain acquisitions or taking
certain other specified actions during the pendency of the merger; and

• matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by First Community management,
which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to First Community as an independent company.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and First Community's board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, First Community stockholders cannot be
certain that First Community will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration First Busey has agreed to provide in
the merger, or that such other merger or business combination will be completed. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, First Community may be
required to pay a termination fee of $9.0 million to First Busey.

First Community Will Be Subject to Business Uncertainties and Contractual Restrictions While the Merger Is Pending.

        Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on First Community and, consequently, on First Busey. These
uncertainties may impair First Community's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal
with First Community to seek to change existing business relationships with First Community. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the
merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of
integration or a desire not to remain with the business, First Busey's business following the merger could be negatively impacted. In addition, the merger agreement restricts First
Community from making certain transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of First Busey until the merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent First
Community from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.

First Community Directors and Officers May Have Interests in the Merger Different From the Interests of First Community Stockholders.

        The interests of some of the directors and executive officers of First Community may be different from those of First Community stockholders, and directors and officers of
First Community may be participants in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to, those of First Community stockholders. The members of the First
Community's board of directors knew about these additional interests and considered them among other matters, when making its decision to approve the merger agreement, and
in recommending that First Community's common stockholders vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. Such interests include, among others:

• The acceleration of vesting of outstanding director stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units; 

• Entering into an employment agreement with the Chief Executive Officer of First Community; 

• The receipt of certain change in control benefits; and 

• The continuation of service on First Busey's board of directors of one First Community director.

        These interests are more fully described in this proxy statement/prospectus under the section titled "The Merger—Interests of certain persons in the merger."

The Merger Agreement Contains Provisions that May Discourage Other Companies from Trying to Acquire First Community for Greater Merger Consideration.

        The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to First Community that might result in
greater value to First Community's stockholders than the proposed merger with First Busey or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share
price to acquire First Community than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such provisions. These provisions include a general prohibition on First Community from
soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by First Community's board of directors, entering into discussions with any third party
regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions. First Community also has an unqualified obligation to submit the proposal to approve the merger to a
vote by its stockholders, even if First Community receives an alternative acquisition proposal that its board of directors believes is superior to the merger, unless the merger
agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms. In addition, First Community may be required to pay First Busey a termination fee of $9.0 million upon termination
of the merger agreement in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions. See "Description of the Merger Agreement—Termination" and
"Description of the Merger Agreement—Termination fees."

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information Included in This Proxy Statement/Prospectus Is Preliminary and the Actual
Financial Condition and Results of Operations After the Merger May Differ Materially.

        The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of
what the combined company's actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the date(s) indicated. The preparation of the
pro forma financial information is based upon available information and certain assumptions and estimates that First Busey and First Community currently believe are
reasonable. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to allocate the purchase price to First Community's
net assets. The purchase price allocation reflected in this proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and the final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual
purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of First Community as of the date of the completion of the merger. In addition, following the completion of the
merger, there may be further refinements of the purchase price allocation as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments
may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The Opinion of First Community's Financial Advisor Will Not Reflect Changes in Circumstances Between the Signing of the Merger Agreement and the Completion of the
Merger.

        First Community has not obtained an updated opinion from its financial advisor as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations and prospects of
First Community or First Busey, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of First Community or First Busey, and on which First
Community's financial advisor's opinion was based, may significantly alter the value of First Community or the prices of the First Busey common shares or shares of First
Community common stock by the time the merger is completed. The opinion does not speak as of the time the merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of
such opinion. Because First Community does not currently anticipate asking its financial advisor to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger
consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed.

First Busey and First Community Will Incur Transaction and Integration Costs in Connection with the Merger.

        Each of First Busey and First Community has incurred and expects that it will incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the merger. In
addition, First Busey will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as First Busey integrates the businesses of the two companies, including facilities and
systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will
be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. See the risk factor entitled "—First Busey May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Merger" on
page 27. First Busey and First Community may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. First Busey and First Community will also
incur significant legal, financial advisor, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and
other costs associated with the merger.

The shares of First Busey common stock to be received by First Community common stockholders as a result of the merger will have different rights from the shares of First
Community common stock.

        Upon completion of the merger, First Community common stockholders will become First Busey stockholders and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the
Nevada Revised Statutes and the First Busey articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights associated with First Community common stock are different from the rights
associated with First Busey common stock. Please see "Comparison of Rights of First Busey Stockholders and First Community Stockholders" for a discussion of the different
rights associated with First Busey common stock.

The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, subjects banks with assets in excess of $10 billion to additional costs.

        The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (which we refer to as the "Dodd-Frank Act") and its implementing regulations subject banks
with assets in excess of $10 billion to additional requirements, such as the imposition of higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (which we refer to as "FDIC") premiums,
reduced debit card interchange fees, enhanced risk management frameworks and stress testing, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings. As First Busey
approaches $10 billion in assets, it will be required to incur additional costs to address these additional requirements.

Risks Relating to First Busey's Business

        You should read and consider risk factors specific to First Busey's business that will also affect the combined company after the merger. These risks are described in the
sections entitled "Risk Factors" in First Busey's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and in other documents incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus. Please see the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" for the location of information incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Risks Relating to First Community's Business

        You should read and consider risk factors specific to First Community's business that will also affect the combined company after the merger. These risks are described in

SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the
financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of First Busey and First Community. Forward-looking statements, which may be
based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of First Busey's and First Community's management and on information currently available to management, are generally
identifiable by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "may," "will," "would," "could," "should" or other similar expressions.
Additionally, all statements in this proxy statement/prospectus, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and neither First Busey nor First
Community undertakes any obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events. A number of factors, many of which are beyond the ability of First
Busey and First Community to control or predict, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others,
the following:

• the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction between First Busey and First Community will not be realized or will not be realized
within the expected time period; 

• the risk that integration of operations of First Community with those of First Busey will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; 

• the inability to complete the proposed transaction due to the failure of the required stockholder approval; 

• the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the proposed transaction, including receipt of required regulatory and other approvals; 

• the failure of the proposed transaction to close for any other reason; 

• the potential impact of the announcement of the transaction on third party relationships, including customer relationships, and operating results; 

• the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; 

• the strength of the local and national economy; 

• customer acceptance of the combined company's products and services; 

• changes in state and federal laws, regulations and governmental policies concerning First Busey's and First Community's general business; 

• changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of First Busey's and First Community's assets; 

• increased competition in the financial services sector and the inability to attract new customers; 

• changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; 

• the loss of key executives or employees; 

• changes in consumer spending; 

• unexpected results of acquisitions, including the acquisition of First Community; 

• unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation involving First Busey or First Community; 

• the economic impact of any future terrorist threats or attacks;

• the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and blizzards; and 

• changes in accounting policies and practices.

        These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Additional
information concerning First Busey and First Community and their business, including additional factors that could materially affect First Busey's and First Community's
financial results, are included in First Busey's and First Community's filings with the SEC.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

        This proxy statement/prospectus contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are used by
management, together with the related GAAP measures, in analysis of the companies' performance and in making business decisions. Management also uses these measures for
peer comparisons.

        The non-GAAP disclosures contained herein should not be viewed as substitutes for the results determined to be in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily
comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING OF FIRST COMMUNITY STOCKHOLDERS 

Purpose 

        First Community stockholders are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because on April 17, 2017, the record date for the special meeting of stockholders to be held on
June 7, 2017, at Chicago Marriott Southwest at Burr Ridge, 1200 Burr Ridge Parkway, Burr Ridge, Illinois 60527 at 10:30 a.m., local time, they owned shares of the common
stock of First Community, and the board of directors of First Community is soliciting proxies for the matters to be voted on at this special meeting, as described in more detail
below. Copies of this proxy statement/prospectus began to be mailed to holders of First Community common stock on May 1, 2017, and is accompanied by a proxy card for use
at the special meeting and at any adjournment(s) of the meeting.

        At the special meeting, First Community board of directors will ask you to vote upon the following:

• a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein; and 

• a proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting to permit further solicitation in the event that an insufficient number of votes are cast to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein.

        When you sign the enclosed proxy card or otherwise vote pursuant to the instructions set forth on the proxy card, you appoint the proxy holder as your
representative at the special meeting. The proxy holder will vote your shares as you have instructed in the proxy card, thereby ensuring that your shares will be voted
whether or not you attend the special meeting. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we ask that you instruct the proxies how to vote your shares in advance of
the special meeting just in case your plans change.

        If you have not already done so, please complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy card and return it promptly in the enclosed, postage paid envelope or
otherwise vote pursuant to the instructions set forth on the proxy card. Instead of voting by mailing a proxy card, record stockholders can vote their shares of First
Community common stock via the Internet or by telephone. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, allow
stockholders to provide their voting instructions and confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. Specific instructions for Internet or telephone voting
are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. If you do not vote your shares as instructed on the proxy card, or if you do not attend and cast your vote at the special
meeting, the effect will be a vote against the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein.

Record date, quorum and vote required 

        The record date for the First Community special meeting is April 17, 2017. First Community's stockholders of record as of the close of business on that day will receive
notice of and will be entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 17,744,886 shares of First Community common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting. The outstanding shares are held by approximately 750 holders of record.

        The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of First Community common stock entitled to vote on the merger agreement is necessary to constitute a
quorum at the special meeting. Each share of First Community common stock outstanding on the record date entitles its holder to one vote on the matters being brought before
the special meeting.

        To determine the presence of a quorum at the special meeting, First Community will also count as present the shares of First Community common stock present in person
but not voting, and the shares of common stock for which First Community has received proxies but with respect to which the holders

of such shares have abstained or signed without providing instructions. Broker non-votes are not counted as present for the purposes of determining quorum. Based on the
number of shares of First Community common stock outstanding as of the record date, at least 8,872,444 shares need to be present at the special meeting, whether in person or by
proxy, to constitute a quorum.

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of First Community common stock entitled to vote.
Abstentions, shares not voted and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal. Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of shares of First Community common stock represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions are
deemed to be represented at the special meeting and thereby have the same effect as a vote against the adjournment proposal. Shares not voted and broker non-votes will have no
effect on the adjournment proposal, although they may prevent First Community from obtaining a quorum and require First Community to adjourn the special meeting to solicit
additional proxies.

        As of the record date for the special meeting, First Community's directors and executive officers beneficially owned a total of 4,727,934 shares, or approximately 26.0% of
the outstanding shares, of First Community common stock. These individuals have entered into a written agreement with First Busey that they will vote their shares in favor of
the merger agreement, except as may be limited by their fiduciary obligations.

How to vote your shares 

        Instead of voting by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card, stockholders of record can also vote their shares of First Community common stock via the
Internet or by telephone. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, allow stockholders to provide their voting instructions
and confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. Specific instructions for Internet or telephone voting are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. The deadline for
voting by telephone or via the Internet is 10:59 p.m, central time, on June 6, 2017.

        If you properly complete and timely submit your proxy, your shares will be voted as you have directed. You may vote for, against, or abstain with respect to the matter
brought before the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares and submit your proxy without specifying a voting instruction, your shares will be voted as the
First Community board of directors recommends and will be voted "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein and "FOR" the
adjournment of the special meeting to permit further solicitation in the event that an insufficient number of votes are cast to approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated therein. If you do not vote your shares as instructed on the proxy card, or if you do not attend and cast your vote at the special meeting, the effect will be a vote
against the merger agreement.

        You should not send any stock certificates with your proxy card. If the merger is approved, you will receive instructions for exchanging your stock certificates
after the merger has been completed.

Shares held in "street name" 

        If you hold shares in "street name" with a broker, bank or other fiduciary, you will receive voting instructions from the holder of record of your shares. Under the rules of
various national and regional securities exchanges, brokers, banks and other fiduciaries may generally vote your shares on routine matters, such as the ratification of an
independent registered public accounting firm, even if you provide no instructions, but may not vote on non-routine matters, such as the matters being brought before the special
meeting, unless you provide voting instructions. Shares for which a broker, bank or other fiduciary does not have the authority to vote are recorded as "broker non-votes" and are
not

counted in the vote by stockholders or for purposes of a quorum. As a result, any broker non-votes will have the practical effect of a vote against the merger proposal but will not
affect the adjournment proposal.

        We therefore encourage you to provide directions to your broker, bank or other fiduciary as to how you want your shares voted on all matters to be brought before the
special meeting. You should do this by carefully following the instructions your broker, bank or other fiduciary gives you concerning its procedures. Your broker, bank or other
fiduciary may allow you to deliver your voting instructions via the telephone or the Internet. Please see the instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other fiduciary that
accompanies this proxy statement. If you wish to change your voting instructions after you have returned your voting instruction form to your broker, bank or other fiduciary, you
must contact your broker, bank or other fiduciary. If you want to vote your shares of First Community common stock held in street name in person at the special meeting, you
will need to obtain a written proxy in your name from your broker, bank or other fiduciary.

Revocability of proxies 

        You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting, regardless of whether you submitted your original proxy by mail, the Internet or
telephone. To revoke your proxy, you must either advise the Corporate Secretary of First Community in writing before your First Community common stock has been voted at
the special meeting, deliver a later dated proxy or attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in itself constitute
revocation of your proxy.

        All written notices of revocation and other communication with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to: First Community Financial Partners, Inc.,
Corporate Secretary, 2801 Black Road, Joliet, Illinois 60435. If you hold your shares in the name of a broker, bank or other fiduciary and desire to revoke your proxy, you will
need to contact your broker, bank or other fiduciary to revoke your proxy.

Proxy solicitation 

        First Community will pay the costs associated with the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. First Community will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians,
nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of First Community. In addition to the solicitation of
proxies by mail, directors, officers and employees of First Community may solicit proxies personally or by telephone. None of these persons will receive additional compensation
for these activities.

THE FIRST COMMUNITY PROPOSALS
Proposal 1—Approval of the Merger Agreement 

        At the First Community special meeting, stockholders of First Community will be asked to approve the merger agreement, pursuant to which First Community will merge
with and into First Busey, and the transactions contemplated therein. Stockholders of First Community should read this proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety,
including the appendices, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. A copy of the merger agreement is attached
to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

        For the reasons discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus, the board of directors of First Community unanimously determined that the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated therein are in the best interests of First Community and its stockholders, and unanimously adopted and approved the merger
agreement. The board of directors of First Community unanimously recommends that First Community stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated therein.

Proposal 2—Adjournment of the Special Meeting 

        If, at the First Community special meeting, the number of shares of First Community common stock cast in favor of the merger agreement is insufficient to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, First Community intends to move to adjourn the First Community special meeting in order to enable the board of
directors of First Community to solicit additional proxies for approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. In this proposal, First Community is
asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the board of directors of First Community, on a discretionary basis, to vote in favor of adjourning the
First Community special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies.

        The board of directors of First Community unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the special meeting.

THE MERGER 

        This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the merger. While First Busey and First Community believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire
proxy statement/prospectus, the attached Appendixes and the other documents to which this proxy statement/prospectus refers for a more complete understanding of the merger.
The agreement and plan of merger attached hereto as Appendix A, not this summary, is the legal document which governs the merger.

General 

        The First Community board of directors is using this proxy statement/prospectus to solicit proxies from the holders of First Community common stock for use at the First
Community special meeting of stockholders, at which First Community stockholders will be asked to approve the merger agreement and thereby approve the merger. When the
merger is completed, First Community will merge with and into First Busey and will cease to exist, which will result in First Community Financial Bank being a wholly-owned
subsidiary of First Busey. The merger is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017. At a date following the completion of the merger, First Busey intends to merge First
Community Financial Bank with and into Busey Bank, with Busey Bank as the surviving bank. At such time, First Community Financial Bank's banking offices will become
banking offices of Busey Bank. Until the banks are merged, First Busey will own and operate First Community Financial Bank and Busey Bank as separate bank subsidiaries.

        Each share of First Community common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares owned by First Community as
treasury stock or otherwise owned by First Community or First Busey and any dissenting shares), will be converted into the right to $1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of First Busey
common shares pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain adjustments as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Only whole shares of First Busey
common stock will be issued in the merger. As a result, cash will be paid instead of any fractional shares based on the reference price of First Busey common stock. Shares of
First Community common stock held by First Community stockholders who elect to exercise their dissenters' rights will not be converted into merger consideration.

Background of the merger 

        The First Community board of directors has regularly reviewed and discussed First Community's business strategy, performance and prospects in the context of the
economic environment, developments in the regulation of financial institutions and the competitive landscape. With this in mind, in 2013, the board of directors formed a special
committee, Strategic/Capital Planning Committee (which we refer to as the "Strategic Committee") chaired by George Barr, First Community's Chairman of the Board. Among
other things, these discussions have included possible strategic alternatives available to First Community, such as potential acquisitions or business combinations involving other
financial institutions. In connection with the evaluation of these strategic alternatives, and in furtherance of enhancing profitability and maximizing stockholder value, Roy
Thygesen, First Community's Chief Executive Officer, along with members of the Strategic Committee, has had, from time to time, discussions with representatives of other
financial institutions and has regularly updated the board regarding such discussions. Additionally, the First Community management and Strategic Committee has periodically
met with a number of investment banking firms with experience in business combinations in the financial services industry in Illinois and contiguous areas to discuss First
Community's strategic options, including continuing operations on a standalone basis, mergers of equals or a sale to a strategic partner.

        First Busey's executive team and board of directors also regularly and actively considers First Busey's business and strategic direction. Through the past several years, First
Busey's board of directors and executive management team has consistently maintained that they believe it was in the best interests of First Busey's stockholders to remain an
independent entity and focus on First Busey's asset quality, capital position and the communities that it serves. As the economy in its market areas stabilized and showed
indications of sustained recovery, they continued to emphasize First Busey's asset quality and they also began to explore ways to take advantage of the different opportunities to
grow, both organically and through strategic transactions, particularly in new markets in the Midwestern United States, including the St. Louis market, which led to its acquisition
of Pulaski Financial Corp. in 2016.

        While First Busey's management team has not targeted the city of Chicago for potential market expansion, they have monitored activity in the Chicagoland area and have
been interested in evaluating different opportunities to enter markets around, but outside the city of Chicago. In this regard, First Busey's executive management has regularly met
from time to time with financial advisors, including representatives from Stephens Inc. (which we refer to as "Stephens"), to discuss various trends in the industry, the merger and
acquisition market and particular financial institutions around northern Illinois and near Chicago that could be strategic partners. The executive management team regularly
reported this information to the full board of directors to keep the directors properly knowledgeable and informed on First Busey's strategic alternatives.

        In late June 2016, FIG Partners, LLC (which we refer to as "FIG") introduced Van Dukeman, First Busey's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robin Elliott, First
Busey's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to Mr. Barr, and Mr. Thygesen. At this meeting, the principals discussed generally their
respective businesses, the current state of the banking industry and challenges faced by banks in the general economic and regulatory environment. FIG updated the Strategic
Committee on the meeting with Mr. Dukeman and Mr. Elliott at the Strategic Committee meeting on July 15, 2016. Mr. Dukeman also updated the First Busey board at its
regular July board meeting. In connection with the July board meeting, several of First Community's directors traveled to Champaign and met with certain members of First
Busey's board and held general discussions regarding their respective companies, businesses and the state of the M&A market. FIG updated the Strategic Committee about this
discussion in early August 2016.

        Around the time of its introductory discussions with First Busey, First Community hired five lenders from a local Chicago area bank, finished its acquisition of Mazon State
Bank in July 2016 and were in serious negotiations to acquire another Chicago area bank. It was the board's and management's intention to finalize the terms of this acquisition
while discussions with First Busey continued.

        Mr. Dukeman and Mr. Thygesen remained in contact through the next several months regarding their respective businesses, the general banking environment and First
Community's general ongoing strategy. FIG provided First Community's management and board with regular valuation updates regarding a possible transaction with First Busey.
In particular, FIG reviewed the effect of various pricing scenarios with First Busey and the impact of those pricing scenarios on earnings per share accretion and tangible book
value pay-back periods. FIG also highlighted the fact that First Busey traded at a slight discount to its peers and its stock price appeared to be undervalued.

        In late October 2016, Mr. Dukeman, Mr. Thygesen and representatives from FIG held additional discussions regarding a possible strategic transaction between First Busey
and First Community. Shortly after that time, representatives of First Busey contacted representatives of First Community to request that the parties enter into a non-exclusive
mutual confidentiality agreement so that the parties could continue their preliminary, non-binding discussions of the potential benefits and risks of a strategic transaction. First
Busey's executive management updated the board on the ongoing discussions with First Community and the First Busey board authorized management to continue discussions
with First

Community's management and its advisors. FIG and Mr. Thygesen updated the Strategic Committee with respect to its discussions with First Busey and the need to share
confidential information and financial projections for fruitful discussions to continue. The Strategic Committee authorized Mr. Thygesen to review and sign the confidentiality
agreement and provide First Busey with the information requested. Following a discussion of strategic alternatives, current market conditions, sale opportunities, process timeline
and the potential market reactions to the presidential election, the Strategic Committee authorized Mr. Thygesen and FIG to continue conversations with First Busey. The parties
entered into a confidentiality agreement on November 3, 2016.

        Over the next several weeks, First Busey conducted limited due diligence on First Community and First Busey's management team evaluated First Community's business
and the possible benefits and risks associated with a business combination with First Community. On November 15, 2016, First Busey's board, in consultation with its executive
management team, authorized the continuation of the limited due diligence and the preparation of a non-binding indication of interest that could be delivered to First Community,
pending further board approval. Over the next several weeks, First Busey's executive team continued evaluating First Community's business, held several conversations with
Mr. Thygesen and prepared a non-binding indication of interest, which was approved by First Busey's board.

        Following the Strategic Committee's evaluation and review of its strategic goals and alternatives, the Strategic Committee directed First Community management to
negotiate an engagement agreement with FIG representatives to consider a sale to a strategic partner. First Community and FIG executed an engagement agreement on
December 2, 2016.

        On December 12, 2016, First Busey provided First Community with a written, non-binding indication of interest with respect to a possible business combination in which
First Busey would acquire First Community for consideration of between $12.25 and $12.75 per share in the form of 90% First Busey common stock and 10% cash. The
proposed consideration was contingent upon a number of factors, including the results of First Busey's due diligence of First Community's organization. The indication of interest
also outlined certain other key merger considerations, including, among other things, integration plans, employee retention expectations, benefit packages, proposed severance
arrangements for employees, material conditions for closing, regulatory standing and required approvals and additional requirements. The closing price of First Community's
common stock on December 12, 2016, was $10.70.

        At the same time that these discussions were occurring, First Community's Leadership & Compensation Committee (which we refer to as the "Compensation Committee")
was actively interviewing compensation consultants to review executive management compensation to ensure it was competitive and performance based. Based upon the
discussions with First Busey, the Compensation Committee delayed the engagement of an outside compensation consultant. However, based upon the competitive salary and
benefit data provided as part of the consultant interview process, the Compensation Committee agreed to amend the employment agreement of Mr. Thygesen. In addition to an
increase in Mr. Thygesen's base salary, the employment agreement was amended to increase the severance period from one year to two years. On December 17, 2016, an
amendment to Mr. Thygesen employment agreement was formally executed.

        Upon receipt of the indication of interest, FIG prepared an analysis of the terms of the transaction and presented these findings to the Strategic Committee. The analysis
included First Community alone and with its possible acquisition target. After reviewing the price range, the earnings per share accretion/dilution analysis, the tangible book
value pay-back period, the current M&A market, the transaction structure, the financial performance of First Busey, the implications of the presidential election on bank stock
prices, the Strategic Committee determined that the indication of interest pricing range was inadequate. At the direction of the Strategic Committee, FIG indicated that First

Community would continue to discuss a strategic transaction with First Busey only if First Busey increased the proposed consideration.

        On December 21, 2016, Mr. Barr, Mr. Thygesen, Patrick Roe, First Community's President and Chief Operating Officer, Glen Stiteley, First Community's Chief Financial
Officer, and members of the FIG team met with Mr. Dukeman and Mr. Elliott to discuss 2016 performance, the outlook for the next three years, a detailed list of employee,
director and vendor cost savings and expected one-time merger related costs. First Community management also detailed where additional revenue and cost saving assumptions
may be found. Messrs. Dukeman and Elliott asked numerous questions and discussed their experience in achieving the projected cost savings from the Pulaski Financial Corp.
transaction.

        On December 22, 2016, First Busey contacted Stephens regarding the potential transaction with First Community and representatives of Stephens began their analysis of a
potential transaction and, over the next several days, worked closely with First Busey's management to develop a revised indication of interest. On December 27, 2016, First
Busey submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest to First Community. The revised indication of interest provided for a fixed exchange ratio between 0.420 and 0.435
shares of First Busey common stock for every share of First Community common stock. The proposed consideration was still payable in 90% First Busey common stock and
10% cash. Based on the closing price of First Busey's common stock on December 27, 2016, the revised exchange ratio equated to a per share value of between $12.98 and
$13.45. First Community's common stock closed at $10.80 on December 27, 2016.

        The Strategic Committee and FIG discussed the revised indication of interest on December 28, 2016. After reviewing the financial implications of the revised indication of
interest and analyzing key economic assumptions underlying the revised indication of interest, the Strategic Committee felt that the price range was still insufficient. The
Strategic Committee also expressed concern that there was not adequate protection to its stockholders should First Busey's stock decline between the signing of the definitive
agreement and the closing of the transaction.

        After being notified that First Community continued to believe that First Busey's proposal did not reflect adequate value for First Community's stockholders, First Busey's
management met with representatives from Stephens and, on December 29, 2016, submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest with a fixed value of 0.440 shares of
First Busey common stock for each share of First Community common stock. The proposed consideration remained a mix of 90% First Busey common stock (which equated to
0.396 shares of First Busey common stock) and 10% cash. Additionally, the revised indication of interest provided for price protection for First Community with a double trigger
walk-away provision allowing First Community to terminate the transaction if First Busey's common stock price declines 20% or more from the date of execution of a merger
agreement and it declines more than 20% relative to a bank stock index. The revised proposal was subject to First Busey's completion of a more fulsome due diligence
investigation of First Community, as well as, among other things, First Busey obtaining final approval from its board of directors and the parties' negotiation of a mutually
acceptable definitive agreement. Based on the closing price of First Busey's common stock on December 29, 2016, the revised exchange ratio equated to an implied per share
value of $13.61. First Community's common stock closed at $11.75 on December 29, 2016.

        On December 30, 2016, First Busey and First Community agreed to negotiate a merger agreement based upon the indication of interest from First Busey dated
December 29, 2016 and to conduct additional due diligence on the other party. In early-January 2017, First Busey was granted access to a virtual data room populated by First
Community and its advisors for the purpose of commencing more fulsome due diligence review of First Community.

        On January 9, 2017, FIG provided First Community's board with an analysis of the First Busey indication of interest. If the transaction were valued at First Busey's stock
price on January 2, 2017, the

price to be paid for First Community would have been $13.55 per share, consisting of $1.36 per share in cash and $12.19 in First Busey stock. At this time, FIG also provided the
First Community board of directors with a significant analysis of certain other potential strategic buyers previously contacted by First Community, the pros and cons of each
potential strategic buyer, each potential strategic buyer's ability to complete a transaction, the possible transaction structure and amount and type of consideration that could be
offered by each potential strategic buyer, the competitive and regulator challenges that a prospective deal with each potential strategic buyer might face, and the financial
performance of each potential strategic buyer. The First Community board also asked its legal advisor, Howard & Howard, to summarize the transaction negotiations to-date,
discuss key anticipated definitive agreement terms, and outline the fiduciary responsibilities of board members when the board is presented with a potential sale of the company.
After the First Community board of directors discussed the offer amongst itself, with FIG and with Howard & Howard, it determined that the price was sufficient to discuss a
definitive agreement with First Busey. The board did request that FIG propose an alternative to the double trigger provision contained in the indication of interest. FIG outlined to
the board several alternatives to the double trigger, including a decreased double trigger percentage, a floor on First Busey's stock price and a collar on First Busey's stock price.

        On January 11, 2017, First Busey and its legal advisor, Barack Ferrazzano, provided First Community and Howard & Howard with an initial draft merger agreement for the
proposed transaction. Over the course of the following weeks, the parties and their respective legal advisors exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and worked toward
finalizing the terms of the transaction, due diligence issues requiring resolution prior to execution of a definitive agreement, price adjustment mechanism, final pricing
information, terms of representations and warranties for both sides, covenants for both sides and termination rights and fees.

        Also in mid-January, First Community presented First Busey with a "reverse" due diligence list regarding First Busey. First Busey populated a virtual data room with the
requested documents and First Community and its advisors reviewed the documentation throughout the negotiation of the merger agreement.

        On January 25, 2017, First Busey and First Community agreed to fix the per share cash portion of the merger consideration at $1.35 in cash for each share of First
Community common stock, which was approximately 10% of the value of the implied value of exchange rate as of December 29, 2016, the date the parties agreed to move
forward to conduct more fulsome due diligence and negotiate a merger agreement. Also at that time, at First Community's request, First Busey agreed to remove from the merger
agreement the double trigger walk-away right that was described in the indication of interest and replaced it with a price protection collar structure in which the exchange ratio
might adjust if the price of First Busey's common stock increases or decreases more than 22.5% from its stock price calculated as of the execution of the merger agreement. See
"Description of the Merger Agreement—Consideration to be received in the merger" for a discussion of this structure.

        As outlined in the indication of interest letters, First Busey believes that it is important to the success of the post-transaction company to retain Mr. Thygesen following a
transaction. During the last half of January, representatives of First Busey held a number of conversations with Mr. Thygesen regarding the terms of his employment following a
transaction. See "The Merger—Interests of certain persons in the merger" for a discussion of Mr. Thygesen's employment terms.

        On February 2, 2017, certain executives from First Community, along with representatives from FIG, met with certain executives from First Busey to ask questions and to
supplement First Community's due diligence review of the First Busey organization.

        On February 3, 2017, the First Community board of directors held a special meeting, together with representatives of FIG and Howard & Howard, to review for the First
Community board of directors the final terms of the transaction documents, including the director voting agreements, and the board's

fiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of the proposed merger. FIG reviewed its draft written opinion to the First Community board of directors that, as of that date,
and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of First Community common stock. Management also reported to the board on the results of First Community's reverse due diligence investigation on First Busey. The
First Community board of directors discussed at length the transaction, the pricing terms and financial strength of First Busey, the ability to consider a superior proposal if one
were to emerge, the termination fee that would be payable upon termination of the definitive agreement in certain circumstances, and the conditions to closing, specifically the
regulatory approval provisions. In this regard, the First Community board considered the financial analyses of FIG regarding the valuation of First Community as a stand-alone
entity. The directors discussed the attributes of First Busey's common stock, including its recent market performance, its dividend payout ratio and its trading volume. The board
also discussed First Busey's commitment to community banking and its general corporate philosophy. Following extensive discussion and questions and answers, including
consideration of the factors described under "First Community's reasons for the merger and recommendation of First Community's board of directors", the First Community
board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, were in the best interest of First
Community and its stockholders. The board then authorized the First Community management to sign the definitive agreement on February 6, 2017, assuming there were no
significant changes to the deal terms, the definitive agreement and/or general market conditions, and to recommend that the First Community stockholders approve the adoption
of the merger agreement.

        Representatives of Howard & Howard and Barack Ferrazzano, in consultation with their respective clients, continued to finalize the disclosure schedules and certain
employment matters for Mr. Thygesen and other employees through the February 4th weekend.

        On February 6, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting with representatives of Howard & Howard and FIG. At the meeting, representatives of Howard & Howard
discussed the final terms of the merger agreement in detail and answered questions about the agreement. Additionally, representatives of FIG updated the Strategic Committee on
several final changes to the deal terms, which included the final sale price and the collar stock price parameters. FIG then led a discussion with the Strategic Committee regarding
the merger agreement's financial terms, as well as summarized for the Strategic Committee the general economic and market climate, attributes about First Community's common
stock, including its performance and trading characteristics, the key aspects of the sale process to date, due diligence activities undertaken and the several rounds of indications of
interest, as well as summarizing comparable, recent merger transactions. After a lengthy discussion among the Strategic Committee members, utilizing the authority granted to
them by the First Community board, the Strategic Committee authorized management to sign the definitive agreement and recommend that the First Community stockholders
approve the adoption of the merger agreement.

        Also on February 6, 2017, the First Busey board of directors held a special meeting to discuss the proposed transaction and to review the final terms of merger agreement.
Representatives of Barack Ferrazzano reviewed in detail the terms of the agreement and also discussed a possible timetable for the transaction based on final approval of the
agreement, as well as other legal issues including the board's fiduciary duties owed to the First Busey stockholders. Management also reported to the board the results of First
Busey's due diligence investigation of First Community. Further, representatives of Stephens reviewed with the board of directors its analysis of the financial terms contained in
the merger agreement. The board discussed the advantages and rationales for proceeding with the transaction and determined that it was in the best interests of First Busey's
stockholders to proceed with the transaction on the terms provided in the merger agreement. Based on this and its previous discussions, the First Busey board of directors
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the

issuance of shares contemplated in the agreement. Representatives of First Busey reported the board's actions to First Community's representatives following the meeting.

        Following the respective board meetings of First Busey and First Community, in the afternoon of February 6, 2017, First Busey and First Community executed the merger
agreement and First Busey and First Community executed the voting agreements entered into with the directors of First Community. Shortly thereafter, on February 6, 2017, First
Busey and First Community issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

First Community's reasons for the merger and recommendation of the board of directors 

        After careful consideration, the First Community board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, including the merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, is in the best interests of First Community and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement.

        In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommend that its stockholders
vote "FOR" the merger agreement, the First Community board of directors consulted with First Community management, as well as its independent financial and legal advisors,
and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors:

• its knowledge of First Community's business, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings, loan portfolio, capital and prospects both as an independent
organization, and as a part of a combined company with First Busey; 

• its understanding of First Busey's business, operations, regulatory and financial condition, asset quality, earnings, capital and prospects taking into account
presentations by senior management of its due diligence review of First Busey and information furnished by FIG; 

• the fact that the implied value of the merger consideration as of February 2, 2017 of $12.90 for each share of First Community common stock, based on First
Busey's closing price of $29.17 on that date, represented a 9.3% premium over the closing price of its common stock on February 2, 2017; 

• its belief that the merger will result in a stronger commercial banking franchise with a diversified revenue stream, strong capital ratios, a well-balanced loan
portfolio and an attractive funding base that has the potential to deliver a higher value to First Community's stockholders as compared to continuing to operate as a
stand-alone entity; 

• the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the combined company, given its larger size, asset base,
capital, market capitalization and footprint; 

• the anticipated pro forma impact of the merger on First Busey, including potential synergies, and the expected impact on financial metrics such as earnings and
tangible common equity per share, as well as on regulatory capital levels; 

• the financial analyses of FIG and its written opinion, dated as of February 6, 2017, delivered to the First Community board of directors to the effect that, as of that
date, and subject to and based on the various assumptions, considerations, qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of First Community common stock; 

• the structure of the transaction, which would give First Community stockholders the opportunity to participate as stockholders of First Busey in the future
performance of the combined company;

• the historical performance of each of First Community's common stock and First Busey's common stock and the dividend paid for each; 

• the fact that upon completion of the merger First Community stockholders will own approximately 15.5% of the outstanding shares of the combined company; 

• the more active trading market in First Busey common stock would give First Community stockholders greater liquidity for their investment; 

• the benefits to First Community and its customers of operating as a larger organization, including enhancements in products and services, higher lending limits,
and greater financial resources; 

• the increasing importance of operational scale and financial resources in maintaining efficiency and remaining competitive over the long term and in being able to
capitalize on technological developments that significantly impact industry competitive conditions; 

• the expected social and economic impact of the merger on the constituencies served by First Community, including its borrowers, customers, depositors,
employees, and communities; 

• the effects of the merger on other First Community employees, including the prospects for continued employment in a larger organization and various benefits
agreed to be provided to First Community employees; 

• the board's understanding of the current and prospective environment in which First Community and First Busey operate, including national and local economic
conditions, the interest rate environment, increasing operating costs resulting from regulatory initiatives and compliance mandates, and the competitive effects of
the continuing consolidation in the banking industry; 

• the ability of First Busey to complete the merger from a financial and regulatory perspective; 

• the board's understanding that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, providing favorable tax
consequences to First Community's stockholders in the merger; and 

• the board's review with its independent legal advisor, Howard & Howard, of the material terms of the merger agreement, including the board's ability, under
certain circumstances, to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation to First Community's stockholders and to consider and pursue a better
unsolicited acquisition proposal, subject to the potential payment by First Community of a termination fee to First Busey, which the board of directors concluded
was reasonable in the context of termination fees in comparable transactions and in light of the overall terms of the merger agreement, as well as the nature of the
covenants, representations and warranties and termination provisions in the merger agreement.

        The First Community board of directors also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties associated with the merger in connection with its deliberation of the
proposed transaction, including, without limitation, the following:

• the risk that the consideration to be paid to First Community stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of First Busey common
stock during the pendency of the merger; 

• the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of First Community's business and towards the completion of the merger; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of First Community's business prior to the completion of the merger, which are customary for public company merger agreements
involving financial institutions, but which, subject to specific exceptions, could delay or prevent First Community

from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take with respect to the operations of First Community absent the
pending merger;

• the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully integrating First Community's business, operations and
workforce with those of First Busey; 

• the fact that the interests of certain of First Community's directors and executive officers may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of First
Community's other stockholders as described under the heading "Description of the Merger—Interests of certain persons in the merger;" 

• that, while First Community expects that the merger will be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the
merger agreement will be satisfied, including the risk that necessary regulatory approvals or the First Community stockholder approval might not be obtained and,
as a result, the merger may not be completed; 

• the risk of potential employee attrition and/or adverse effects on business and customer relationships as a result of the pending merger; 

• the fact that: (i) First Community would be prohibited from affirmatively soliciting acquisition proposals after execution of the merger agreement; and (ii) First
Community would be obligated to pay to First Busey a termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, which may discourage
other parties potentially interested in a strategic transaction with First Community from pursuing such a transaction; and 

• the possibility of litigation challenging the merger, and its belief that any such litigation would be without merit.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the First Community board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material
factors considered by the First Community board of directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, the First Community board of directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given
different weights to different factors. The First Community board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning of First
Community's management and First Community's independent financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its
determination.

        The board of directors of First Community unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
therein and "FOR" approval to adjourn the special meeting to permit further solicitation in the event that an insufficient number of votes are cast to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. First Community stockholders should be aware that First Community's directors and executive officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other First Community stockholders. The First Community board of directors was aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, and in recommending that the merger proposal be approved by the
stockholders of First Community. See "The Merger—Interests of certain persons in the merger."

        This summary of the reasoning of First Community's board of directors and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be
read in light of the factors discussed under the heading "Special Notes Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."

Opinion of FIG Partners, LLC 

        FIG has delivered to the board of directors of First Community its opinion that, based upon and subject to the various considerations set forth in its written opinion dated as
of February 6, 2017, the merger consideration to be paid by First Busey is fair to the stockholders of First Community from a financial perspective as of such date. In requesting
FIG's investment banking advice and in rendering its opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration to be received, no limitations were imposed by First Community upon
FIG with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion. The full text of the opinion of FIG, dated February 6, 2017, which describes the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached hereto as Appendix D. First Community stockholders should
read this opinion in its entirety.

        FIG is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of financial institutions in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and valuations for other corporate purposes. As a specialist in securities of financial institutions, FIG has
experience in, and knowledge of, banks, thrifts and bank and thrift holding companies. The board of directors of First Community selected FIG to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the merger on the basis of the firm's reputation and expertise in transactions such as the merger.

        FIG's opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration, and, as such, does not constitute a recommendation to
any First Community stockholder as to how the stockholder should vote at the First Community stockholder meeting. The summary of the opinion of FIG set forth in
this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

        The following is a summary of the analyses performed by FIG in connection with its opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration. Certain analyses were
demonstrated in a presentation to the board of directors of First Community by FIG. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of either the
analyses performed by FIG in rendering its opinion or the entirety of the presentation delivered by FIG to the board of directors of First Community, but rather it summarizes the
material analyses performed and presented by FIG in forming its conclusions as to the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial perspective.

        The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. In arriving at its opinion, FIG did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis and factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. FIG may have given various analyses more or less weight than other analyses. Accordingly,
FIG believes that its analyses and the following summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering all factors, could create
an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth in its report to the board of directors of First Community and in rendering its fairness opinion.

        In performing its analyses, FIG made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of First Community or First Busey. The analyses performed by FIG are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were prepared solely as part of FIG's analysis of the fairness of the merger
consideration, from a financial point of view, to First Community stockholders. The analyses do not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the prices at which a company might
actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at the present time or at any time in the future. FIG's opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any other business combination in which First Community might engage. In addition, as described above, FIG's opinion to the board of

directors of First Community was one of many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors of First Community in making its determination to approve the merger
agreement.

        During the course of its engagement, and as a basis for arriving at its opinion, FIG reviewed and analyzed numerous materials bearing upon the financial and operating
conditions of First Community and First Busey and materials and agreements prepared in connection with the merger. As part of its review and analysis, FIG, among other
things,

• reviewed the final draft of the merger agreement dated February 6, 2017; 

• reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning First Community including, among other things, quarterly and annual
reports filed with the SEC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC; 

• reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning First Busey including, among other things, quarterly and annual
reports filed with the SEC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC; 

• reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning First Community and First Busey as well as analyzed pro forma
regulatory capital levels; 

• utilized earnings per share estimates for First Community for the years ending December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2021, as provided by the senior management
of First Community; 

• utilized publicly available median analyst earnings per share estimates for First Busey for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, and an estimated long-
term annual earnings per share growth rate of 6.0% for the years thereafter; 

• utilized in its analyses certain assumptions related to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustment as well as certain cost savings. With respect to these
estimates, the senior management of the First Community and First Busey confirmed to us that they reflected the best currently available estimates of the senior
management of First Community and First Busey; 

• held discussions with members of the senior managements of First Community and First Busey for the purpose of reviewing the future prospects of First
Community and First Busey, including financial estimates related to their respective businesses, earnings, assets, and liabilities and credit quality; 

• reviewed the terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions, to the extent publicly available, involving banks and bank holding companies that we considered
and deemed relevant; 

• reviewed trading activity in First Community's and First Busey's common stock over the last twelve months relative to price and volume; 

• reviewed First Community's and First Busey's financial performance and current valuation metrics relative to other publicly traded banks which were deemed
similar to First Community; and 

• performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed relevant and appropriate.

        FIG also took into account its experience in other transactions, as well as its knowledge of the commercial banking industry and its general experience in securities
valuations.

        In rendering its opinion, FIG assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the publicly and non-publicly available financial and other
information furnished to FIG by First Community and First Busey and relied upon the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in the merger
agreement. FIG also assumed that the financial forecasts discussed with FIG by First Community and First Busey were reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently
available estimates and judgments of senior management of First Community and First Busey as to the future financial performance of First Community and First Busey. FIG has
not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any properties, assets or liabilities of First Community or First Busey.

Contribution Analysis 

        FIG analyzed the relative contribution of First Community and First Busey to the pro forma balance sheet and income of the combined entity, assuming approximately 90%
of the merger consideration consists of First Busey common stock. This analysis excluded purchase accounting adjustments. To perform this analysis, FIG used historical balance
sheet and net income data for both companies as of December 31, 2016. The results of FIG's analysis are set forth in the following table, which also compares the results of the
analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of First Community and First Busey respective stockholders in the combined company:

Comparable Transaction Analysis 

        As part of its analysis, FIG reviewed two groups of comparable merger transactions. The first peer group included transactions, which have been announced or completed
since January 1, 2016, that involved target banks located in the U.S. that had total assets between $1.0 billion and $5.0 billion (which we refer to as "Precedent Transactions—
U.S."). All consideration types were included. The group was also limited to transactions where pricing was disclosed. This group consisted of the following 26 transactions:

        In addition, FIG also reviewed comparable transactions which have been announced or completed since January 1, 2015, that involved target banks located in the Midwest
region of the U.S. (KS, KY, IL, IN, IA, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, SD, & WI) that had total assets of between $1.0 billion and $5.0 billion (which we refer to as "Precedent

        FIG calculated the medians and averages of the following relevant transaction ratios in the Precedent Transactions—U.S. and the Precedent Transactions—Midwest: the
percentage of the offer value to the acquired company's tangible book value, last twelve months earnings (which we refer to as "LTM"), total assets, and the tangible book value
premium to core deposits. FIG compared these multiples with the corresponding multiples for the merger, valuing the total merger consideration that would be received pursuant
to the merger agreement as of February 6, 2017, at approximately $239.2 million, or $12.96 per First Community common share based upon the per share merger consideration
to be received of $1.35 in cash plus 0.396 shares of First Busey, valued at the then trading value of $29.33 as of February 6, 2017. In calculating the multiples for the merger, FIG
used First Community's tangible book value per share, last twelve months earnings, total assets, and total core deposits as of December 31, 2016. The results of this analysis are

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 

        FIG estimated the present value per share of First Community common stock based on estimated future earnings stream for the years ending December 31, 2017 through
December 31, 2021, derived from First Community's internal projections. To approximate the terminal value of First Community common stock at December 31, 2021, FIG
applied price to tangible book value multiples ranging from 180% to 220% of estimated tangible book value in 2021 and price to earnings multiples ranging from 18 to 22 times
2021 estimated earnings. The resulting implied terminal values were then discounted to present values using different discount rates ranging from 10% to 14%. The discount
rates chosen by FIG were intended to reflect different assumptions regarding the required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of First Community's common stock.
The following tables show implied range per share of First Community common stock.

 

Pro Forma Financial Impact 

        FIG analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger, based on the following assumptions: (i) the merger closes in the second calendar quarter of 2017; and
(ii) each share of the outstanding First Community common stock is converted into the right to receive $1.35 in cash plus 0.396 shares of First Busey. FIG also incorporated the
following assumptions, as provided by or based on discussion with the respective senior managements of First Community and First Busey: (i) purchase accounting adjustments
consisting of (A) a credit mark on loans and (B) a core deposit intangible asset; (ii) estimated annual cost savings; (iii) estimated, pre-tax, one-time transaction costs; and (iv) an
annual pre-tax opportunity cost of cash. The analysis indicated that the merger could be accretive to the combined company's estimated earnings per share in 2017 (excluding
one-time transaction expenses) and dilutive to estimated tangible book value per share at close. In connection with this analyses, FIG considered and discussed with the board of
directors and senior management of First Community how the analysis would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions, including the impact of final purchase
accounting adjustments determined at the closing of the transaction, and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the
variations may be material.

Comparable Company Analysis—Combined Company

        FIG is acting as First Community's financial advisor in connection with the merger and First Community has agreed to pay FIG a fee for such services equal to 1.0% of the
aggregate merger consideration; of which, $15,000 was payable as an upfront retainer and $250,000 was payable upon the rendering of its opinion and the balance is contingent
upon the consummation of the merger. Based on First Busey's February 6, 2017, closing price of $29.33, FIG would receive total fees of approximately $2.4 million for all
services performed in the merger, inclusive of the retainer and fairness opinion fees. First Community has also agreed to indemnify FIG against any claims or liabilities arising
out of FIG's engagement by First Community. In addition to this engagement, in the past two years, FIG has provided investment banking and financial advisory services to First
Community, but has not received compensation for such services. In the past two years, FIG has provided investment banking and financial advisory services to First Busey and
received compensation for such services. FIG served as financial advisor to First Busey in connection with its acquisition of Pulaski Financial Corporation.

        Based upon the foregoing analyses and other investigations and assumptions set forth in its opinion, without giving specific weightings to any one factor or
comparison, FIG determined that the merger consideration was fair, from a financial perspective, to the First Community common stockholders.

First Busey's reasons for the merger 

        First Busey's board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of First Busey and its stockholders. In deciding to approve the merger, First Busey's board of
directors after consulting with its management as well as its legal and financial advisors, considered a number of factors, including the following, which are not presented in
order of priority:

• management's view that the acquisition of First Community provides an attractive opportunity to expand into desirable markets, including the Chicagoland area; 

• First Community's complementary relationship-oriented community banking model, and its compatibility with First Busey and its subsidiaries; 

• a review of the demographic, economic and financial characteristics of the markets in which First Community operates, including existing and potential
competition and history of the market areas with respect to financial institutions; 

• management's review of First Community's business, operations, earnings and financial condition, including its management, capital levels and strong asset
quality; 

• anticipated efficiencies to come from integrating certain of First Community's operations into First Busey's existing operations; 

• its review and discussions with First Busey's management and Barack Ferrazzano, First Busey's legal counsel, concerning the due diligence investigation of First
Community; 

• management's expectation that First Busey will retain its strong capital position upon completion of the transaction; 

• the opportunity to build a greater recognition and awareness of the First Busey brand; 

• the financial presentation, dated February 6, 2017, of Stephens, First Busey's financial advisor, to the First Busey board of directors; 

• the terms of the merger agreement, including the expected tax treatment and termination fee provisions, which it reviewed with First Busey's outside legal and
financial advisors; 

• the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of First Busey's business and towards the completion of the merger;

• the potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully integrating First Community's business, operations and
workforce with those of First Busey; and 

• the likelihood that the merger will be approved by the relevant bank regulatory authorities without undue burden and in a timely manner.

        The above discussion of the information and factors considered by First Busey's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes a description of material
factors considered by First Busey's board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the First Busey board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger,
the First Busey board did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered. In
considering the factors described above, individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors. First Busey's board of directors collectively made its
determination with respect to the merger based on the conclusion reached by its members, based on the factors that each of them considered appropriate, that the merger is in the
best interests of First Busey's stockholders.

Accounting treatment of the merger 

        For accounting and financial reporting purposes, the merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with
GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts and other commitments) of
First Community as of the effective time of the merger will be recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of First Busey. Any excess of purchase price over the
fair values is recorded as goodwill. Consolidated financial statements of First Busey issued after the merger will reflect these fair values and will not be restated retroactively to
reflect the historical consolidated financial position or results of operations of First Community.

Material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger 

        The following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of First Community common stock.
The summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings and practice, all as in effect as of the date
hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not address any tax consequences of the merger under state, local or foreign
laws, or any federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner that is: an individual citizen or resident of the United States; a corporation (or other entity
taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions; a trust that (i) is subject
to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations
to be treated as a U.S. person; or an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its income regardless of its source.

        This discussion addresses only those U.S. holders of First Community common stock that hold their First Community common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code and does not address all the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular holders of First Community
common stock in light of their individual circumstances or to holders of First Community common stock that are subject to special rules, such as non-U.S. holders (as defined
below) (except to the extent discussed under the subheading "Tax Implications to Non-U.S. Stockholders" below); financial institutions; investors in pass-through entities;
persons who are subject to alternative minimum tax; insurance companies; mutual funds; tax-exempt organizations; dealers in securities or currencies; traders in securities that
elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting; persons that hold First Community common stock as part of a straddle, hedge,

constructive sale or conversion or other integrated transaction; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; persons whose "functional currency" is not the U.S.
dollar; and holders who acquired their shares of First Community common stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation.

        If a partnership (or other entity that is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes) holds First Community common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in that
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their own tax
advisors about the tax consequences of the merger to them.

        The parties intend for the merger to be treated as a "reorganization" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each of Barack Ferrazzano and Howard & Howard have delivered
opinions, dated March 15, 2017, and filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, to the effect that (i) the merger will
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) First Community and First Busey will each be a party to such reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (iii) no gain or loss will be recognized to First Community's stockholders upon receipt of First Busey
common stock in exchange for their shares of First Community common stock, except to the extent of any cash consideration received and any cash received in lieu of fractional
shares. Additionally, it is a condition to First Community's obligation to complete the merger that First Community receive an opinion from Howard & Howard, dated the closing
date of the merger, and it is a condition to First Busey's obligation to complete the merger that First Busey receive an opinion from Barack Ferrazzano, dated the closing date of
the merger, each to the same effect as the opinions described in the preceding sentence. These conditions are waivable, and First Busey and First Community undertake to
recirculate and resolicit if either of these conditions is waived and the change in tax consequences is material. These opinions are and will be based upon representation letters
provided by First Busey and First Community and upon customary factual assumptions. Neither First Busey nor First Community has sought, and neither of them will seek, any
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any matters relating to the merger, and the opinions described above will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service or
any court. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the
conclusions set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations or assumptions upon which the opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected.

        The actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complex and will depend upon your specific situation and upon factors that are not within the control of First
Busey or First Community. You should consult with your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the merger in light of your particular circumstances, including the
applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local or foreign and other tax laws.

        Tax Consequences of the Merger.    Based upon the facts and representations contained in the representation letters received from First Community and First Busey in
connection with the filing of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, it is the opinion of Barack Ferrazzano and Howard &
Howard that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and accordingly, the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. holders will be as follows:

• No gain or loss will be recognized by First Busey or First Community as a result of the merger. 

• Gain (but not loss) will be recognized by U.S. holders of First Community common stock who receive shares of First Busey common stock and cash in exchange
for shares of First Community common stock pursuant to the merger, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess, if any,

of the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any First Busey common stock received in the merger, over such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares
of First Community common stock surrendered by such U.S. holder in the merger and (ii) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in the merger (other
than cash received in lieu of fractional shares of First Busey common stock, which is discussed below under "—Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares of First Busey
Common Stock.").

• Generally, a U.S. holder's aggregate tax basis in the First Busey common stock received by such U.S. holder in the merger in exchange for its First Community
common stock, including any fractional shares deemed received by the U.S. holder under the treatment discussed below in "—Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares
of First Busey Common Stock," will equal such U.S. holder's aggregate tax basis in the First Community common stock surrendered in the merger, increased by
the amount of taxable gain or dividend income (see below), if any, recognized by such U.S. holder in the merger (other than with respect to cash received in lieu
of fractional shares of First Busey common stock), and decreased by the amount of cash, if any, received by such U.S. holder in the merger (other than cash
received in lieu of fractional shares of First Busey common stock). 

• The holding period for the shares of First Busey common stock received in the merger, including any fractional shares deemed received by the U.S. holder under
the treatment discussed below in "—Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares of First Busey Common Stock," generally will include the holding period for the shares of
First Community common stock exchanged therefor.

        For purposes of calculating the gain recognized by U.S. holders of First Community common stock who receive shares of First Busey common stock and cash in exchange
for shares of First Community common stock pursuant to the merger, the fair market value of First Busey common stock is based on the trading price of that stock on the date of
the merger, rather than the methodology used in calculating the number of shares of First Busey common stock to be issued to the stockholder. In the case of any U.S. holder who
acquired different blocks of First Community common stock at different times and at different prices, any realized gain or loss will be determined separately for each identifiable
block of shares exchanged in the merger. A loss realized on the exchange of one block of shares cannot be used to offset a gain realized on the exchange of another block of
shares, but a U.S. holder will generally be able to reduce its capital gains by capital losses in determining its income tax liability. Such U.S. holder should consult its tax advisor
prior to the exchange with regard to identifying the basis or holding periods of the particular shares of First Busey common stock received in the merger.

        Any capital gain generally will be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder held the shares of First Community common stock for more than one year at the effective time of
the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. All or part of the gain that a particular U.S. holder of First Community common stock recognizes could be
treated as dividend income rather than capital gain if (i) such U.S. holder is a significant stockholder of First Busey or (ii) such U.S. holder's percentage ownership, taking into
account constructive ownership rules, in First Busey after the merger is not meaningfully reduced from what its percentage ownership would have been if it had received solely
shares of First Busey common stock rather than a combination of cash and shares of First Busey common stock in the merger. This could happen, for example, because of
ownership of additional shares of First Busey common stock by such holder, ownership of shares of First Busey common stock by a person related to such holder or a share
repurchase by First Busey from other holders of First Busey common stock. These rules are complex and dependent upon the specific factual circumstances particular to each
U.S. holder. Consequently, each U.S. holder that may be subject to those rules should consult its tax advisor as to the application of these rules to the particular facts relevant to
such U.S. holder.

Table of Contents

        Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares of First Busey Common Stock.    A U.S. holder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of First Busey common stock will be
treated as having received the fractional share of First Busey common stock pursuant to the merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share of First Busey common
stock for cash in a redemption by First Busey. In general, this deemed redemption will be treated as a sale or exchange, and a U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between (i) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder and (ii) the portion of the basis of the shares of First Community common stock allocable to such
fractional interest. Such gain or loss generally will constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for the First
Community common stock exchanged by such U.S. Holder is greater than one year as of the effective time of the merger.

        Medicare Tax on Unearned Income.    A U.S. holder that is an individual is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (i) his or her "net investment income" for the relevant
taxable year or (ii) the excess of his or her modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (between $125,000 and $250,000 depending on the
individual's U.S. federal income tax filing status). A similar regime applies to estates and trusts. Net investment income generally would include any capital gain realized in
connection with the merger.

        Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.    Payments of cash to a U.S. holder of First Community common stock pursuant to the merger may, under certain
circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption satisfactory to
First Busey and the exchange agent or, in the case of backup withholding, furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of
the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder under the backup withholding rules are not additional tax and generally will be allowed as a
refund or credit against the U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

        A U.S. holder of First Community common stock, as a result of having received First Busey common stock in the merger, will be required to retain records pertaining to the
merger. In addition, each U.S. holder of First Community common stock who is a "significant holder" will be required to file a statement with such holder's U.S. federal income
tax return in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(b) setting forth such holder's basis in the First Community common stock surrendered and the fair market
value of the First Busey common stock and cash received in the merger. A "significant holder" is a holder of First Community common stock who, immediately before the
merger, owned at least 5% of the vote or value of the outstanding stock of First Community or securities of First Community with a basis for federal income taxes of at least
$1 million.

        Tax Implications to Non-U.S. Stockholders.    For purposes of this discussion, the term "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of First Community common stock
(other than an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder. The rules governing the U.S. federal income taxation of non-U.S.
holders are complex, and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a limited summary of those rules. Any gain a non-U.S. holder recognizes from the exchange of
First Community common stock for First Busey common stock and cash in the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless (i) the gain is
effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States, or (ii) in the case of a non-U.S. holder who is an individual, such
stockholder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale and other conditions are met. Non-U.S. holders described in (i) above will be
subject to tax on gain recognized at applicable U.S. federal income tax rates and, in addition, non-U.S. holders that are corporations (or treated as corporations for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lesser rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on their effectively connected earnings and
profits for the taxable year, which would include such gain. Non-U.S. holders described in (ii) above will be subject to a flat 30% tax on any gain recognized, which may be
offset by U.S. source capital losses.

        This discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent upon, individual circumstances. Moreover, it does not address any non-income tax
or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend upon the facts of your
particular situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult with a tax advisor to determine the particular federal, state, local or foreign.

Regulatory approvals 

        The merger cannot proceed without obtaining all requisite regulatory approvals. First Busey and First Community have agreed to take all appropriate actions necessary to
obtain the required approvals. The merger of First Busey and First Community is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. First Busey submitted an application with the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on February 27, 2017 seeking the necessary approval.

        In reviewing that application, the Federal Reserve is required to consider the following:

• competitive factors, such as whether the merger will result in a monopoly or whether the benefits of the merger to the public in meeting the needs and
convenience of the community clearly outweigh the merger's anticompetitive effects or restraints on trade; and 

• banking and community factors, which includes an evaluation of: 

• the financial and managerial resources of First Busey, including its subsidiaries, and of First Community, and the effect of the proposed transaction on
these resources; 

• management expertise; 

• internal control and risk management systems; 

• the capital of First Community; 

• the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and 

• the effectiveness of First Community and First Busey in combating money laundering activities.

        The application process includes publication and opportunity for comment by the public. The Federal Reserve may receive, and must consider, properly filed comments and
protests from community groups and others regarding (among other issues) each institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended. The
merger may not be completed until 15 days after receipt of Federal Reserve approval, during which time the United States Department of Justice may challenge the merger on
antitrust grounds. The commencement of an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's approval, unless a court specifically orders otherwise.

        At a date following the completion of the merger, First Busey intends to merge First Community Financial Bank with and into Busey Bank, with Busey Bank as the
surviving bank. The bank merger will be subject to approval by the IDFPR. Busey Bank intends to file an application with the IDFPR seeking this approval in the near future.

        While First Busey knows of no reason why the approval of any of the applications would be denied or unduly delayed, it cannot assure you that all regulatory approvals
required to complete the merger will be obtained or obtained in a timely manner.

Interests of certain persons in the merger 

        In considering the recommendations of the First Community board of directors, First Community stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive officers
of First Community and First Community Financial Bank may have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition

to, the interests of First Community stockholders generally. The First Community board of directors was aware of these interests to the extent these interests existed at the time
the First Community board of directors approved the merger agreement and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and determining to
recommend to First Community stockholders to vote for approval of the merger agreement.

        Stock Ownership.    As of April 17, 2017, First Community's directors beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 4,675,395 shares of First Community's common stock,
representing approximately 25.6% of First Community's outstanding shares of common stock. Additionally, as of April 17, 2017, First Community's directors and executive
officers collectively beneficially owned 4,727,934 shares, constituting approximately 26.0% of the shares then outstanding.

        Appointment to the Boards of Directors of First Busey Corporation and Busey Bank.    Pursuant to the merger agreement, First Busey will appoint one current director of
First Community to the First Busey board of directors and, upon completion of the bank merger, will appoint one individual mutually agreeable to the parties to the Busey Bank
board of directors.

        Prior Employment Agreements between First Community and Roy Thygesen, Patrick Roe and Glen Stiteley.    First Community and First Community Financial Bank
previously entered into employment agreements with Roy Thygesen, Chief Executive Officer of First Community and First Community Financial Bank, Patrick Roe, President
and Chief Operating Officer of First Community and First Community Financial Bank, and Glen Stiteley, Chief Financial Officer of First Community and First Community
Financial Bank. Mr. Thygesen's employment agreement provides for change in control payments, if within the six months prior to, or the 24 months following, a change in
control, Mr. Thygesen's employment is terminated by First Community and First Community Financial Bank (other than for cause or due to death or disability), or by
Mr. Thygesen for good reason. In either case, Mr. Thygesen would be entitled to a lump sum payment of $1,185,059, based on two times his base compensation, along with
continued medical insurance benefits for 12 months following his termination of employment based on active employee rates (with an estimated current value of $13,460). Base
compensation includes Mr. Thygesen's base salary at the time of the change in control plus the average of his annual cash incentive bonuses for the three most recently completed
fiscal-year performance periods.

        The employment agreements for Messrs. Roe and Stiteley provide for change in control payments, if within the six months prior to, or the 24 months following, a change in
control, the executive's employment is terminated by First Community and First Community Financial Bank (other than for cause or due to death or disability), or by the
executive for good reason. In either case, Messrs. Roe and Stiteley would be entitled to lump sum payments of $462,968 and $326,920, respectively, based the executive's base
compensation, along with continued medical insurance benefits for 12 months following the executive's termination of employment based on active employee rates (with an
estimated current value of $9,535 and $13,460, respectively). Base compensation includes the executive's base salary at the time of the change in control plus the average of the
executive's annual cash incentive bonuses for the three most recently completed fiscal-year performance periods.

        If the change in control payments due to Messrs. Thygesen, Roe and Stiteley under the employment agreements or any other benefits or payments would trigger liability
under the Internal Revenue Code as an excise tax on payments constituting "excess parachute payments," then the change in control payments will be reduced to the greater of
(i) the largest portion of the change in control payment that results in no portion of the change in control payment being subject to the excise tax, or (ii) the largest portion of the
change in control payment (up to and including the total change in control payment) that results in the executive's receipt of a greater net after-tax benefit (after taking into
account all applicable income, employment and excise taxes) notwithstanding that all or some portion of the change in control payment may be subject to the excise tax or
become non-deductible

compensation expense. Under applicable law, the excise tax is triggered by the executive's receipt of payments that are contingent on a change in control that equal or exceed
three times the executive's average annual taxable compensation over the five years preceding the change in control, or such lesser time if the executive has not been employed
by the employer for five years. The excise tax equals 20% of the amount of the payment in excess of the executive's average compensation over the preceding five-year period, or
such lesser period. Per the Merger Agreement, First Community agreed to take necessary steps to ensure that payments to Messrs. Thygesen, Roe and Stiteley will not trigger any
such excise taxes.

Retention and Employment Agreements with First Busey.

        On February 6, 2017, First Busey and Busey Bank, in connection with the merger, entered into a new employment agreement with Roy Thygesen, Chief Executive Officer
of First Community and First Community Financial Bank, contingent upon the closing of, and to become effective upon the effective time of the merger. Under the terms of his
employment agreement, Mr. Thygesen will receive an annual base salary of $350,000 in connection with his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of First Community
Financial Bank from the effective time of the merger through the date of the bank merger, and then as Executive Vice President/Commercial Market President, Northern Illinois
of Busey Bank. Mr. Thygesen will be eligible to participate in First Busey's annual incentive plan and will be entitled to a minimum bonus of $200,000 when bonuses are paid in
2018. Mr. Thygesen will also be eligible to participate in First Busey's long-term equity incentive program and will be recommended for a grant of restricted stock or restricted
stock units on or around July 1, 2017 with a grant date fair value of $200,000, which will vest on the earliest to occur of (i) the fifth anniversary of the grant date,
(ii) Mr. Thygesen's retirement (other than due to a termination for cause) after attaining age 62 and not becoming employed at any time by a financial institution within 150 miles
of an office of First Busey, Busey Bank or their affiliates, or (iii) a change in control of First Busey. In addition, Mr. Thygesen will also be entitled to a retention bonus of
$1,185,059 to be paid on the first payroll period following the effective time of the merger. The employment agreement also addresses participation in incentive compensation
and other benefits plans, plans providing retirement, medical, dental, disability and group life benefits and other fringe benefits including participation in First Busey's key life
insurance program with a death benefit in the amount of $1,000,000.

        Mr. Thygesen's employment agreement has an initial term of one year commencing upon the effective time of the merger. The term shall automatically renew for one
additional year at the end of the then existing term unless either party provides written notice 30 days prior to the end of the then existing term that such party does not intend to
extend the term.

        Under his employment agreement, if Mr. Thygesen voluntary terminates his employment or his employment is terminated for "cause," as that term is defined in his
employment agreement, he will receive his base salary and any other earned amounts through the date on which the termination of employment becomes effective. If following
the first anniversary of the effective time of the merger (or following a change in control of First Busey prior to the first anniversary of the effective time of the merger),
Mr. Thygesen is terminated without cause or voluntarily terminates with "good reason," as that term is defined in the agreement, he will receive a cash payment in an amount
equal to the then applicable base salary plus the amount of his most recent performance bonus and will be entitled to 12 months of continuing health insurance coverage at active
employee rates. In addition, in connection with the above referenced payments, Mr. Thygesen agreed to a one year non-competition restriction within a 30 mile radius of from
each banking and other office of First Busey, Busey Bank, First Community, First Community Financial Bank and their respective affiliates, and a one year non-solicitation
restriction with respect to employees and known customers of First Busey, Busey Bank, First Community, First Community Financial Bank and their respective affiliates.

        Split Dollar Life Insurance Plans.    First Community Financial Bank is a party to split dollar life insurance agreements with Messrs. Thygesen, Roe and Stiteley which
provide for a death benefit payable upon the executive's death prior to attainment of age 70, provided that at the time of death the executive was (i) employed by First Community
Financial Bank, (ii) had been previously terminated from First Community Financial Bank due to disability, or (iii) had been previously terminated from First Community
Financial Bank for any reason subsequent to a change in control of First Community. The amount of the death benefit is equal to the lower of the net at risk value of the
underlying policy, or $400,000, $400,000 or $300,000 for Messrs. Thygesen, Roe and Stiteley, respectively.

        First Community Equity Plans.    First Community maintains the First Community Financial Partners, Inc. Amended and Restated 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (which we
refer to as the "2008 Equity Incentive Plan"), the First Community Financial Partners, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the "2013 Equity Incentive Plan"),
and the First Community Financial Partners, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the "2016 Equity Incentive Plan").

        Under the terms of the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan any unvested options vest and become fully exercisable and any unvested restricted stock unit or performance stock unit
awards become fully earned and vested immediately upon a change in control. Under the terms of the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, any
unvested options vest and become fully exercisable and all restricted stock units become fully earned and vested immediately if (i) the plan and underlying award agreements are
not the obligation of the successor following a change in control, or (ii) the plan and underlying award agreements are the obligation the successor following a change in control
and the executive's employment is terminated without cause or the executive resigns for good reason.

        Per the terms of the award agreements under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, any unvested performance stock units for which the
performance period is scheduled to end during the calendar year of the change in control are deemed to be earned and vest immediately prior to the change in control based on
the projected level of achievement of the performance goals through the end of the performance period and 50% of any unvested performance stock units for which the
performance period is scheduled to end in a year following the year of the change in control are deemed to be earned and vest immediately prior to the change in control. Any
other unvested performance stock units that do not become earned and vested immediately prior to the change in control in accordance with the previous sentence are forfeited by
the participant upon the change in control.

        Treatment of First Community Equity Awards.    Per the terms of the merger agreement, the outstanding equity awards under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2013 Equity
Incentive Plan and the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan will be treated as follows:

• Employee Stock Options.  At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of First Community common stock, other than director
stock options as discussed below, will be converted automatically into a stock option exercisable for that number of shares of First Busey common stock equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of First Community common stock subject to the First Community stock option immediately prior to the effective time
multiplied by (ii) the option exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), with an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(A) the exercise price per share of First Community common stock of the First Community stock option immediately prior to the effective time by (B) the option
exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each First Community stock option assumed and converted will continue to be subject to the same terms
and conditions, as applicable immediately prior to the effective time. The option exchange ratio is the ratio of (i) the sum of (A) the exchange ratio (0.396)
multiplied by the closing sales price of a share of First Busey common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding
the effective time of the

merger, plus (B) the cash consideration ($1.35), divided by (ii) the closing sales price of a share of First Busey common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger.

• Director Stock Options.  At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of First Community common stock granted to a
participant for service as a past or current member of the board of directors or an advisory board of First Community or First Community Financial Bank, or its
affiliates, whether vested or unvested, will be cashed out by virtue of the merger in an amount equal to the closing sales price of a share of First Community
common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger less the amount of the exercise
price of the option. 

• Restricted Stock Units.  At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit representing the right to receive one share of First Community
common stock will be cashed out by virtue of the merger in an amount equal to the closing sales price of a share of First Community common stock on the
NASDAQ Capital Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. 

• Performance Stock Units.  At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding performance stock unit award representing the right to receive one share of First
Community common stock subject to a performance vesting condition will be deemed to be earned and vested at target level performance (defined as "Stretch"
level of performance in the actual award agreements) and will be cashed out by virtue of the merger in an amount equal to the closing sales price of a share of
First Community common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. Any
performance stock unit representing the right to receive one share of First Community common stock subject to a performance vesting condition that does not vest
in connection with the merger will be cancelled and forfeited as of the effective time of the merger. 

• Quantification of Value of Unvested Equity Awards.  We estimate that the aggregate value to Messrs. Thygesen, Roe and Stiteley upon the acceleration of the
vesting of unvested stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards to be $145,431, $98,904 and $113,659, respectively, assuming
the effective time of the merger occurred on July 1, 2017 and as if each executive is terminated in connection with the merger. Based on equity awards outstanding
as of February 28, 2017 and additional grants of restricted stock units for 2017 board service expected to be made prior to the effective time of the merger, we
estimate that the aggregate value to First Community's current non-employee directors upon the acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options and
restricted stock unit awards to be $1,167,662 in the aggregate, assuming the effective time of the merger occurred on July 1, 2017. The amounts specified in this
paragraph are determined using a price per share of First Community common stock of $13.00, the closing sales price of a share of First Community common
stock as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 13, 2017.

        Continued Director and Officer Liability Coverage.    Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, First Busey agreed to maintain, for up to six years following the
effective time, insurance coverage under the current policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by First Community for actions taken prior to the effective
time of the merger. If a six-year term of insurance coverage is not available, the term for the insurance will be such other maximum period of time for which coverage is available
at a cost not to exceed 250% of the premiums First Community paid for its current policy term. Following the effective time, to the extent permitted by applicable law, First
Busey has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the current and former directors, officers and employees of First Community and its subsidiaries for all actions taken by them
prior to the effective time of the merger.

Restrictions on resale of First Busey common stock 

        The shares of First Busey common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and will be freely transferable,
except for shares issued to any stockholder who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of First Busey for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Persons who may be
deemed to be affiliates of First Busey include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with First Busey and may include the executive
officers, directors and significant stockholders of First Busey.

First Community stockholder dissenters' rights 

        General.    Dissenters' rights with respect to First Community common stock are governed by Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA. First Community stockholders have the
right to dissent from the merger and to obtain payment of the fair value of their shares in the event the merger is completed. Strict compliance with the dissent procedures is
mandatory. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, the parties could elect to terminate the merger agreement even if it is approved by First Community stockholders, thus
terminating dissenters' rights available to First Community stockholders.

        First Community urges any First Community stockholder who contemplates exercising his, her or its right to dissent to read carefully the provisions of Sections 11.65 and
11.70 of the IBCA, which are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the statute is included below. This
discussion describes the steps that each First Community stockholder must take to exercise his, her or its right to dissent. Each First Community stockholder who wishes to
dissent should read both the summary and the full text of the law. First Community cannot give any First Community stockholder legal advice. To completely understand this
law, each First Community stockholder may want, and First Community encourages any First Community stockholder seeking to dissent, to consult with his, her or its legal
counsel.

        If you comply with the provisions of Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA, then upon completion of the sale, you are entitled to receive payment in cash from First Busey,
as successor to First Community, for the fair value of your shares as of the closing date, with accrued interest. The term "fair value" means the proportionate interest of the
stockholder in First Community, without discount for minority status or, absent extraordinary circumstances, lack of marketability, immediately before the closing of the sale
excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the sale, unless the exclusion would be inequitable. If First Busey and you cannot agree on the fair value of your
shares or the accrued interest, then the IBCA provides for a judicial determination of these amounts. The value determined by an Illinois court may be more or less than the value
you might ultimately receive in cash distributions from First Busey after the closing of the sale. If you desire to exercise dissenters' rights, you should refer to the statute in its
entirety and should consult with legal counsel before taking any action to ensure that you comply strictly with the applicable statutory provisions.

        If you desire to submit the written objection required by Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA prior to the First Community special meeting, send or deliver such objection
to First Community Financial Partners, Inc., Corporate Secretary, 2801 Black Road, Joliet, Illinois 60435. First Community urges any stockholder who wishes to dissent to act
carefully. First Community cannot and does not accept the risk of late or undelivered written objections. First Community's stockholders bear the risk of non-delivery and of
untimely delivery.

        Summary of Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA.    To exercise dissenters' rights under Sections11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA and be entitled to appraisal and payment of
the fair value of his, her or its shares under the IBCA, a First Community stockholder must:

• before the vote on the sale is taken, deliver to First Community a written demand for payment of your shares;

65



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1469134/000104746917003091/a2232019zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

• not vote in favor of the sale (note, however, that solely a vote, in person or by proxy, against approval of the merger agreement will not constitute a written
demand for appraisal); and 

• continue to hold your shares of First Community common stock through the effective time of the merger.

        Your failure to vote against the proposal to approve the merger agreement will constitute a waiver of your dissenters' rights under the IBCA. However, a vote against
approval of the merger agreement will not by itself be sufficient to satisfy your obligations if you are seeking an appraisal. You must follow the procedures set forth in
Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA to obtain dissenters' rights.

        Each outstanding share of Company common stock for which a legally sufficient demand in accordance with Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the IBCA has been made and that
was not voted in favor of approval of the sale will, after the effective time of the sale, represent only the rights of a dissenting stockholder under the IBCA. This includes the right
to obtain payment for the fair value of those shares as provided under the IBCA.

        If you make a legally sufficient demand, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger or 30 days after you have delivered your written demand for payment,
whichever is later, First Busey, as the surviving corporation, will send to you a statement setting forth its opinion as to the fair value of your shares, as well as certain financial
statements and a commitment to pay to you the estimated fair value for your shares. If you do not agree with the opinion of First Busey as to the estimated fair value of the
shares, then within 30 days of your receipt of First Busey's valuation statement, you must notify First Busey of your estimated fair value of your shares and demand the difference
between your estimated fair value and the amount of the proposed payment by First Busey.

        If within 60 days from delivery of First Busey's notice to the dissenting stockholders you and First Busey have not agreed in writing to the fair value of your shares, First
Busey either will pay the difference in value demanded by you, or file a petition in the circuit court requesting the court to determine the fair value of the shares. First Busey will
be required to then make all dissenters to the merger a party to this proceeding. If First Busey does not commence the action, you are permitted by law to commence an action.

        In a proceeding brought by First Busey to determine value, the court will determine the costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation of expenses of the
appraisers appointed by the court and excluding fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties. If the fair value of the shares as determined by the court
materially exceeds the price that First Busey estimated to be the fair value of the shares or if no estimate was given, then all or any part of the costs may be assessed against First
Busey. If the amount that any dissenter estimated to be the fair value of the shares materially exceeds the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, then all or any part of
the costs may be assessed against that dissenter. The costs may also be awarded to the dissenter if the court finds that First Busey did not substantially comply with the procedure
to dissent in the statute. In addition, costs can be assessed against either party if the court finds that that party acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the
dissenter's rights.

        A share for which you have properly exercised your dissenters' rights and followed the correct procedures in the IBCA will no longer constitute a share of the common stock
of First Community. None of these dissenting shares after the effective time of the sale will be entitled to vote for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions. If,
however, you, as the holder of the shares fail to properly perfect, effectively withdraw, waive or lose or otherwise become ineligible to exercise dissenters' rights under the IBCA,
then at that time the shares held by you will again constitute issued and outstanding shares of First Community's common stock.

        The foregoing does not purport to be a complete statement of the provisions of IBCA relating to statutory dissenters' rights and is qualified in its entirety to the dissenters
rights provisions, which are

DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to describe all the terms of the merger agreement and is qualified
by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should read the merger agreement completely and carefully as it, rather than this description, is the legal document that governs the merger.

        The text of the merger agreement has been included to provide you with information regarding its terms. The terms of the merger agreement (such as the representations and
warranties) are intended to govern the contractual rights and relationships, and allocate risks, between the parties in relation to the merger. The merger agreement contains
representations and warranties First Busey and First Community made to each other as of specific dates. The representations and warranties were negotiated between the parties
with the principal purpose of setting forth their respective rights with respect to their obligations to complete the merger. The statements embodied in those representations and
warranties may be subject to important limitations and qualifications as set forth therein, including a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable
under federal securities laws.

General 

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of First Community with and into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving company. The merger is anticipated to be
completed in mid-2017. At a date following the completion of the merger, First Busey intends to merge First Community Financial Bank, First Community's wholly-owned bank
subsidiary, with and into Busey Bank, with Busey Bank as the surviving bank. At such time, First Community Financial Bank's banking offices will become banking offices of
Busey Bank. Until the banks are merged, First Busey will own and operate First Community Financial Bank and Busey Bank as separate bank subsidiaries.

Closing and effective time 

        Closing.    The closing of the merger will take place on the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing set forth in the merger
agreement, or at another time that both parties mutually agree upon. See "Description of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to completion of the merger" for a more complete
description of the conditions that must be satisfied prior to closing. The date of the completion of the merger sometimes is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
closing date.

        Completion of the Merger.    The merger will become effective as of the date and time specified in the articles of merger that will be filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.
The time at which the merger becomes effective is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the effective time.

Consideration to be received in the merger 

        If the merger is completed, each share of First Community common stock which First Community stockholders own immediately before the completion of the merger will
be converted into the right to receive $1.35 in cash and 0.396 shares of common stock of First Busey, subject to certain adjustment as summarized below. Based on the five-day
weighted average closing price of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of $29.31 as of February 3, 2017, the trading day immediately
preceding the public announcement date of the merger, the implied merger consideration that a First Community stockholder would be entitled to receive for each share of First
Community common stock owned would be $12.95 with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $235.8 million.

Table of Contents

        The exchange ratio is subject to the following adjustments:

        Decrease in Market Price of First Busey Common Stock.    If the weighted average daily closing sales price (which we refer to as the "First Busey Market Value") of a share
of First Busey common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days prior to the first date on which all regulatory approvals
(and waivers, if applicable) required for completion of the Merger are received (disregarding any waiting periods) (which we refer to as the "Determination Date") is less than
$22.71 per share, First Community will have the right to terminate the merger agreement unless First Busey elects to increase the exchange ratio within two business days of the
Determination Date. First Busey may elect to increase the exchange ratio to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $8.99 by the First Busey Market Value. If First Busey elects
to increase the exchange ratio, the merger agreement will remain in effect in accordance with its terms, except the stock consideration will be increased to reflect the revised
exchange ratio. If First Busey declines to increase the exchange ratio, First Community will have the option to accept the original exchange ratio without adjustment.

        Increase in Market Price of First Busey Common Stock.    If the First Busey Market Value on the Determination Date is more than $35.90, then the exchange ratio shall be
decreased to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $14.22 by the First Busey Market Value.

        Change in Capitalization.    If, prior to the effective time, there is declared (with an effective time prior to the effective time) or effected a reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), split-up or stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into First Busey common
stock), combination, exchange or readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, First Busey common stock, the exchange ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted to provide to the holders of First Community common stock the same economic effect as contemplated by the merger agreement prior to such event.

        If an adjustment to the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement would require First Busey to issue more than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of into
First Busey common stock at the effective time, then First Busey shall have the right to adjust the exchange ratio so that First Busey would only be required to issue no more than
19.9% of the First Busey common stock, and First Busey shall increase the cash consideration to reflect, on a per share basis, the aggregate value of the total number of shares
that otherwise would have been issuable, valued at the First Busey Market Value.

Fractional shares 

        No fractional shares of First Busey common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead, First Busey will pay to each holder of First Community common stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of First Busey common stock an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the
fraction of a share to which such First Community stockholder would otherwise be entitled by the weighted average closing price of First Busey common stock as reported on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market over the five consecutive trading day period ending immediately preceding the closing date.

Voting and support agreement 

        On February 6, 2017, certain directors of First Community entered into a voting and support agreement with First Busey. Under this agreement, these stockholders have
each agreed to vote, subject to their fiduciary duties, their respective shares of First Community common stock:

• in favor of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

Treatment of First Community stock options and other equity awards 

        First Community Employee Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of First Community common
stock, whether vested or unvested, other than director stock options as discussed below, will be converted into an option to purchase First Busey common stock with respect to
the number of whole shares of First Busey common stock that is equal to the number of shares of First Community common stock subject to such First Community stock option
immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by the option exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of First Busey common
stock equal to the exercise price for each share of First Community common stock subject to such First Community stock option immediately prior to the effective time divided
by the option exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each First Community stock option assumed and converted will continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions of the applicable First Community stock plan pursuant to which such First Community stock option was granted and any associated award agreement, as applicable
immediately prior to the effective time. The option exchange ratio is the ratio of (i) the sum of (A) the exchange ratio multiplied by the closing sales price of a share of First
Busey common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger, plus (B) the cash consideration,
divided by (ii) the closing sales price of a share of First Busey common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective
time of the merger.

        First Community Director Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of First Community common
stock granted to a participant for service as a past or current member of the board of directors or an advisory board of First Community or First Community Financial Bank, or its
affiliates, whether vested or unvested, will be cashed out by virtue of the merger in an amount equal to the closing sales price of a share of First Community common stock on the
NASDAQ Capital Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger less the amount of the exercise price of the option.

        First Community Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit representing the right to receive one share of First
Community common stock will

be cashed out by virtue of the merger in an amount equal to the closing sales price of a share of First Community common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the last
trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger.

        First Community Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding performance stock unit award representing the right to receive one share
of First Community common stock subject to a performance vesting condition will be deemed to be earned and vested at target level performance (defined as "Stretch" level of
performance in the actual award agreements) and will be cashed out by virtue of the merger in an amount equal to the closing sales price of a share of First Community common
stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. Any performance stock unit representing the right to
receive one share of First Community common stock subject to a performance vesting condition that does not vest in connection with the merger will be cancelled and forfeited
as of the effective time of the merger.

Exchange of certificates 

        First Busey has engaged Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to act as its exchange agent to handle the exchange of First Community common stock for the merger
consideration and the payment of cash for any fractional share interests. Within two business days after the closing date, the exchange agent will send to each First Community
certificated record holder a letter of transmittal for use in the exchange with instructions explaining how to surrender First Community common stock certificates to the exchange
agent. First Community stockholders who surrender their certificates to the exchange agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will receive the merger
consideration. First Community stockholders that do not exchange their First Community common stock will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration or any dividends
or other distributions by First Busey until their certificates are surrendered. After surrender of the certificates representing First Community shares, any unpaid dividends or
distributions with respect to the First Busey common stock represented by the certificates will be paid without interest.

        First Community stockholders are not required to take any special additional actions if their shares of First Community common stock are held in book-entry form. After the
completion of the merger, shares of First Community common stock held in book-entry form automatically will be exchanged for the merger consideration, plus cash in lieu of
any fractional shares.

Conduct of business pending the merger 

        Conduct of Business of First Community.    Under the merger agreement, First Community has agreed to certain restrictions on its activities and the activities of its
subsidiaries until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated. In general, First Community and its subsidiaries are required to conduct their business in the
ordinary course of business and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization and advantageous business relationships.

        The following is a summary of the more significant restrictions imposed upon First Community, subject to the exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. First
Community will not, without First Busey's prior written consent or as otherwise provided in the merger agreement:

• issue, sell or otherwise permit to become outstanding, or dispose of or encumber or pledge, or authorize or propose the creation of, any shares of its capital stock
or any security convertible into its capital stock;

Certain covenants of the parties 

        Both parties have agreed to cooperate with the other in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Both
parties agree, among other things:

• to cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts in the preparation and filing of all applications, notices and documents required to obtain regulatory approval
and/or consents from governmental authorities for the merger; 

• to exercise good faith and use reasonable best efforts to satisfy the covenants and conditions required to close the merger and to complete the merger as soon as
practicable; 

• that neither will intentionally act in a manner that would cause a breach of the merger agreement; 

• to coordinate any disclosure of nonpublic information to third parties concerning the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and 

• to provide one another reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the defense of any stockholder litigation against the First Community or First Busey, as
applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        First Community has also agreed to the following:

• to notify First Busey of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and
circumstances known to it, to result in a material adverse effect on First Community; 

• to notify First Busey of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would cause or constitute a material breach of any of First Community's representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure of a closing condition; 

• to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of their respective stockholders for the purpose of obtaining approval of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated therein; 

• to amend or terminate, as requested by First Busey, any of its employee benefit plans; and 

• to use its reasonable best efforts to repay certain of its outstanding indebtedness to MB Financial Bank, N.A. (which we refer to as "MB Financial Bank"), and use
its reasonable best efforts to seek the release of MB Financial Bank's security interest on the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of First Community
Financial Bank pledged to MB Financial Bank in connection with such debt obligation.

        The merger agreement also contains certain covenants relating to employee benefits and other matters pertaining to officers and directors. See "The Merger—Interests of
certain persons in the merger."

No solicitation of or discussions relating to an acquisition proposal 

        The merger agreement contains provisions prohibiting First Community from initiating, soliciting, encouraging or knowingly facilitating an alternative proposal to the
merger. First Community agreed to immediately cease and terminate any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of the merger agreement with any
persons other than First Busey with respect to any acquisition proposal. Moreover, First Community has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries its and its

subsidiaries' officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or proposal or enter into any negotiations or
discussions with any person or entity concerning any proposed acquisition of First Community or its subsidiaries, or furnish any confidential or nonpublic information to any
person or entity proposing or seeking such an acquisition.

        However, the merger agreement provides that First Community may furnish such information pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and engage in such
negotiations or discussions in response to an unsolicited acquisition proposal, if the board of directors of First Community determines in good faith and after consultation with
outside counsel that such proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal, and the failure to take action with respect to such proposal is reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the board of directors' fiduciary duties. If the board of directors of First Community determines that it is necessary to pursue a superior proposal in
order to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties, the board may withhold, withdraw, qualify or adversely modify the board's recommendation to First Community
stockholders with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby, and/or terminate the merger agreement. However, the
First Community board of directors may not terminate the merger agreement for a superior proposal unless it has first notified First Busey and otherwise negotiated with First
Busey so that the merger may be effected.

        Under the merger agreement, a "superior proposal" means any written acquisition proposal which the board of directors of First Community concludes in good faith to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the merger, after (i) receiving the advice of its financial advisors, (ii) taking into account the likelihood and
timing of consummation of the proposed transaction on its terms, and (iii) taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. If First Busey
terminates the merger agreement because First Community breaches its covenant not to solicit an acquisition proposal from a third party or if First Community terminates the
merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal, First Community will pay to First Busey a termination fee equal to $9.0 million. See "Description
of the Merger Agreement—Termination fees."

Representations and warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by First Community and First Busey. These include, among other things, representations relating to:

• valid corporate organization and existence; 

• ownership of their respective subsidiaries; 

• corporate power and authority to enter into the merger and the merger agreement; 

• absence of any breach of organizational documents or law as a result of the merger;

        First Busey and First Community may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time. Subject to conditions and circumstances
described in the merger agreement, either First Busey or First Community may also terminate the merger agreement as follows:

• the other party has breached or failed to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in the failure of any
of the closing conditions and such breach or failure cannot be cured within 30 days, provided its inability to satisfy the condition was not caused by the non-
breaching party's failure to comply in all material respects with any of its obligations under the merger agreement; 

• any regulatory authority has denied approval of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any application for a necessary regulatory
approval has been withdrawn at the request of a regulatory authority, provided that such right to terminate is not available to a party whose failure to fulfill any of
its obligations under the merger agreement has been the cause of the denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval; 

• failure to receive approval by First Community stockholders for the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein following the meeting held for
such purpose, provided that such right to terminate is not available to a party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations under the merger agreement has been
the cause of such failure; 

• the merger is not completed by October 31, 2017, provided that such right to terminate is not available to a party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations
under the merger agreement has resulted in the failure of the merger to be completed before such date; or 

• a court or regulatory authority has enjoined or prohibited any of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement.

        In addition, a particular party may terminate the merger agreement as follows:

• First Busey may terminate if First Community materially breaches any of its obligations with respect to soliciting alternative acquisition proposals or holding a
meeting of its stockholders to approve the merger agreement;

tenth day following the Determination Date.

        Any termination of the merger agreement will not relieve the breaching party from liability resulting from its fraud or any willful and material beach by that party of the
merger agreement.

Termination fees 

Termination Fees Payable by First Community.

        First Community has agreed to pay First Busey a termination fee of $2.5 million if First Busey terminates the merger agreement because First Community has breached or
failed to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in the failure of any of the closing conditions and such breach or

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

        The following tables show unaudited pro forma financial information about the financial condition and results of operations of First Busey, including per share data, after
giving effect to the merger with First Community and other pro forma adjustments. The unaudited pro forma financial information assumes that the merger is accounted for under
the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP, and that the assets and liabilities of First Community will be recorded by First Busey
at their respective fair values as of the date the merger is completed. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if the merger had
occurred on December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 gives effect to the merger as if the
merger had become effective at January 1, 2016. The unaudited selected pro forma combined financial information has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and related notes of First Busey and First Community, which are each incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. See
"Where You Can Find More Information." The unaudited selected pro forma combined financial information does not give effect to the announced acquisition by First Busey of
Mid Illinois. See "Recent Developments."

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not indicate the financial results of the combined
company had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of each period presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not
consider any expense efficiencies, increased revenue or other potential financial benefits of the merger. In addition, as explained in more detail in the accompanying notes, the
preliminary allocation of the pro forma purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary
significantly from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded upon completion of the merger.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Income 

Note 1—Basis of Presentation 

        First Busey has agreed to acquire First Community for a fixed exchange ratio of 0.396 shares of First Busey common stock plus $1.35 in cash for each share of First
Community common stock, subject to certain adjustments if the First Busey Market Value is less than $22.71 or more than $35.90 on the Determination Date. The acquisition
will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities of First Community have been marked to estimated fair value upon
conditions as of December 31, 2016 and as if the transaction had been effective on January 1, 2016 for statement of income data. Since these are pro forma statements, we cannot
assure that the amounts reflected in these financial statements would have been representative of the actual amounts earned had the companies been combined at that time.

Note 2—Pro Forma Adjustments Footnotes 

(1) To adjust First Community's loans to fair value consisting of a $19.1 million discount to adjust for credit deterioration of the acquired portfolio. The interest rate
adjustment was deemed insignificant in relation to the loan balance for this pro forma presentation. Of the $19.1 million credit mark, $12.1 million is expected to be
accreted over an estimated 5 year remaining life of the respective loans in a manner that approximates level yield. 

(2) To eliminate First Community's allowance for loan losses of $11.7 million. 

(3) To reduce First Community's premises to fair value by $0.5 million. Amount to be a reduction in depreciation expense, straight-line over a seven-year weighted-average
remaining useful life. 

(4) To record goodwill of $140.3 million resulting from difference of the purchase price and identifiable net assets.

        Any change in the price of First Busey common stock would change the purchase price allocated to goodwill. The following table presents the sensitivity of the purchase
price and resulting goodwill to changes in the price of Busey common stock of $30.78, the closing price of Busey common stock on December 31, 2016. The revised purchase
price shown for the up 20% scenario has been adjusted, as provided in the merger agreement, to reflect a revised exchange ratio of 0.385 shares of First Busey

common stock plus $1.35 in cash for each share of First Community common stock because the price of First Busey common stock under this scenario was greater than $35.90.

(5) To record core deposit intangible asset of $10.2 million, net of First Community's existing core deposit intangible asset of $0.8 million. Gross amount will be amortized
using a sum of years digits method over a 14 year useful life. This asset was determined based upon the present value of the estimated future cash flows of core deposits
discounted using a weighted average market rate. 

(6) To record a net deferred tax asset related to the transaction expense accrual, fair value adjustments and core deposit intangible. 

(7) The adjustment to deposits was deemed insignificant in relation to the deposit balance for this pro forma presentation. 

(8) To adjust First Community's borrowings to fair value by an increase of $1.0 million. Amount to be accreted straight-line over weighted average remaining life of one year.

(9) To record estimated borrowings totaling $35.3 million used to fund cash portion of merger consideration. The $35.3 million consists of $23.3 million representing the
10% component of the merger consideration, $2.0 million exchanged for employee restricted stock awards and $10.0 million exchanged for terminated directors' stock
options. 

(10) To record accrual of estimated transaction costs of $13.1 million for First Community and First Busey. See footnote 6 for the net deferred tax asset related to these
estimated transaction costs. The estimated transaction costs of $13.1 million, net of tax of $4.1 million, are estimated at $5.7 million for First Community and
$3.3 million for First Busey. First Community's significant costs include $2.0 million of professional fees and $3.2 million of employee related costs, net of tax. First
Busey's significant costs include $0.9 million of professional fees and $1.9 million of vendor termination costs, net of tax. For purposes of the pro forma presentation, the
aggregate amount of these transaction costs is excluded from the pro forma income statements, as consistent with applicable guidance. 

(11) To eliminate First Community's equity accounts at date of acquisition of $113.7 million. 

(12) To record the issuance of 6.8 million shares of First Busey at $30.78 per share totaling $210.2 million. This amount also includes $1.6 million in fair value allocated
356,000 shares of First Community's existing employee option awards converted to First Busey stock options and $1.6 million in fair value allocated to 170,000 shares of
First Community's existing common stock warrants converted to First Busey common stock warrants. 

(13) To record impact of First Busey's portion of the accrued transaction costs totaling $3.3 million, after tax. 

(14) To record accretion of credit mark on loan portfolio. 

(15) To record accretion of interest rate mark on borrowings totaling $1.0 million.

opposed to the best interests of First Community, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

  First Busey's board of directors may, in its discretion, cause the

expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil
or criminal action, suit or proceeding to be paid by First Busey
as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of
the action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it is
ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by First Busey.

 The bylaws provide further that, subject to applicable federal
law and regulation, First Community shall indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of First Community to procure a judgment in its favor
by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of First Community, or is or was serving at the request
of First Community as a director or officer of another
corporation, bank, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the
defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in
good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of First Community;
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the
performance of his or her duty to First Community unless and
only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper.

    The bylaws provide that expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an officer and director in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by First
Community in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding, as authorized by the board of directors in the
specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
the director or officer by or on behalf of whom such expenses
are incurred to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by First
Community as provided in the bylaws.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

        THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (together with all exhibits and schedules, this "Agreement") is entered into as of February 6, 2017, by and between

the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into
Acquiror (the "Merger"), with Acquiror as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Entity").

        B.    The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

        C.    As an inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the directors and executive officers of the Company in office as of the date of this Agreement have,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, entered into a Voting and Support Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

        D.    As further inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the Company's Chief Executive Officer has, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, entered
into an Employment Agreement, by and among Acquiror, Acquiror Bank and such Chief Executive Officer, which becomes effective as of the Effective Time and governs the
terms of continuing employment for such executive.

        E.    The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the parties also agree to certain prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions.

AGREEMENTS 

        In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises, covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1
THE MERGER 

        Section 1.1    The Merger.     Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NRS and the IBCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into
Acquiror pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the NRS and the IBCA, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquiror will be
the Surviving Entity.

        Section 1.2    Effective Time; Closing.     

        (a)   Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually acceptable to Acquiror and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the offices of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum &
Nagelberg LLP, located at 200 West Madison Street, Suite 3900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the

occur of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company may agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). Subject to the
provisions of Article 10, failure to consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.2 will not result in the termination
of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement.

        (b)   The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger with the Nevada Secretary of State (the "Nevada Articles of Merger"), and articles of
merger with the Illinois Secretary of State (the "Illinois Articles of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Nevada Articles
of Merger (the "Effective Time").

        Section 1.3    Effects of the Merger.     At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NRS and the IBCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in the
Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

        Section 1.4    Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity.     The articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Legal
Requirements.

        Section 1.5    Bank Merger.     The parties will cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to effect the Bank Merger at a time to be determined following the Merger. At
the effective time of the Bank Merger, the separate existence of the Bank will terminate. Acquiror Bank will be the surviving bank and will continue its existence under
applicable Legal Requirements. The Bank Merger shall be accomplished pursuant to the statutory bank merger agreement in form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

        Section 1.6    Alternative Structure.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties may mutually agree to
change the method of effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that they deem such a change to be desirable; provided, that: (a) any such change shall not
affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as consideration in the Merger, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, or (iii) require
submission to or approval of the Company's stockholders after the Merger has been approved by the Company's stockholders. If the parties agree to make such a change, they
shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

ARTICLE 2
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 

        Section 2.1    Consideration.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock and subject to Section 2.3, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Company
Common Stock owned by the Company or Acquiror (in each case other than shares of Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit Plan or related trust
accounts or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be converted into the right to receive (collectively, the
"Merger Consideration"): (i) 0.396 (the "Exchange Ratio ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of

Acquiror Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration "); and (ii) $1.35 (the "Cash Consideration "); provided however, that the Exchange Ratio shall be subject to
adjustment as follows:

          (i)  if the Final Acquiror Market Value shall be less than $22.71, Acquiror shall have the option, in its sole discretion, upon providing notice of its election to
the Company within two (2) Business Days of the Determination Date, to adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $8.99 by the Final
Acquiror Market Value.

         (ii)  if the Final Acquiror Market Value shall be less than $22.71, and Acquiror has not exercised its option pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) to adjust the
Exchange Ratio within two (2) Business Days of the Determination Date, the Company shall have the option, in its sole discretion, upon providing notice of its
election to Acquiror within four (4) Business Days of the Determination Date, to accept the Exchange Ratio without further adjustment.

        (iii)  if the Final Acquiror Market Value shall be greater than $35.90, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $14.22
by the Final Acquiror Market Value.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 2.1 would require the Acquiror to issue more
than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock at the Effective Time, then Acquiror shall have the right to adjust the Exchange Ratio so that
the Acquiror would only be required to issue no more than 19.9% of the Acquiror Common Stock, and the Acquiror shall increase the Cash Consideration to reflect, on a
per share basis, the aggregate value of the total number of shares that otherwise would have been issuable, valued at the Final Acquiror Market Value.

        For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

        "Determination Date" means the first date on which all Requisite Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of the Merger have been
received (disregarding any waiting period).

        "Final Acquiror Market Value" means the weighted average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in
the Company's treasury will be cancelled and no shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor.

        (c)   Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, there is declared (with an effective time prior to
the Effective Time) or effected a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), split-up or stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible in Acquiror Common Stock), combination, exchange or readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect
of, Acquiror Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

        Section 2.2    Cancellation of Shares.     At the Effective Time, the shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and
will cease to exist. Certificates (it being understood that any reference herein to a "certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to a book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of Company Common Stock) that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes

to represent only the right to receive: (a) evidence of book-entry notation representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which they were converted
pursuant to this Article 2; (b) cash equal to the Cash Consideration; (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.3, without any interest thereon; and (d) any dividends or distributions that the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(f).

        Section 2.3    No Fractional Shares.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be
issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock
pursuant to this Article 2 shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Closing
Acquiror Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled.

        Section 2.4    Exchange of Certificates.     

        (a)   The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company, N.A. shall serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the
exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent"); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to the Effective Time.
Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

        (b)   At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for payment of the Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (ii) sufficient cash for payment of the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1; (iii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3; and (iv) sufficient cash for the payment of the Company equity awards as required to
pursuant to Section 2.5. Such amount of cash and shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the
Effective Time, are referred to in this Article 2 as the "Conversion Fund."

        (c)   Within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Certificates") a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), in a form to be agreed by the parties,
which specifies, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

        (d)   Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Merger Consideration plus cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3 deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate.

        (e)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Outstanding Company Shares.

        (f)    No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this
Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered
Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which such
holder's Company Common Stock shall have been converted.

        (g)   Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest, for issuance of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Consideration, the payment of the Cash Consideration and
the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders' shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid
dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

        (h)   In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with this Article 2, shares of Acquiror Common stock
pursuant to the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 2.5    Company Equity Awards.     

        (a)    Company Stock Options.    

          (i)  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and except as set forth in Section 2.5(a)(ii), at the Effective Time, Acquiror shall assume the Company
Stock Plans, and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an option award to purchase Acquiror Common Stock with respect to the number of
whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Acquiror
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan, if any,

pursuant to which such Company Stock Option was granted and/or any associated award agreement. It is intended that the conversion of the Company Stock
Options under this Section 2.5(a)(i) shall comply with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code, to the extent applicable, and this Section 2.5(a)(i) shall be construed
consistent with such intent.

         (ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.5(a)(i), the Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option granted to a participant for service as a member of the Company Board or a member of the board of directors of the Bank (each, a "Director Company
Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a Director Company Stock
Option and shall be cashed out by virtue of the Merger into an amount of cash for each share of Company Common Stock subject to the Director Company Stock
Option equal to (a) the Company Final Closing Price, minus (b) the amount of the exercise price of the Director Company Stock Option. In connection with the
cash out of the Director Company Stock Option, the Company shall require the holder of such options to execute a stock option cancellation agreement prior to
payment of such consideration.

        (b)    Cash Out of Restricted Stock Units.    The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each vested restricted stock unit representing
the right to receive one share of Company Common Stock in the future, subject solely to service vesting, granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company
RSU"), including Company RSUs that vest per their terms due to the merger, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a
Company RSU and shall be cashed out by virtue of the Merger into an amount of cash for each share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU equal to
the Company Final Closing Price. The portion of any unvested Company RSUs that does not vest in connection with the Merger shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time. In connection with the cash out of the Company RSUs the Company shall require the holder of such restricted stock units to execute a restricted stock unit
cancellation agreement prior to payment of such consideration.

        (c)    Cash Out of Performance Units.    The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each vested performance unit representing the
right to receive one share of Company Common Stock in the future, subject to a performance vesting condition, granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a
"Company Performance Unit"), including Company Performance Units that vest per their terms due to the Merger (assuming target level of performance through the
Effective Time), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a Company Performance Unit and shall be cashed out by virtue of the
Merger into an amount of cash for each share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Performance Unit equal to the Company Final Closing Price. The
portion of any unvested Company Performance Unit that does not vest in connection with the Merger shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time. In connection with the

down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Warrant Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Warrant. Acquiror and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to comply with the terms of the Warrants. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause each
holder of a Warrant to exercise such Warrant at or prior to the Effective Time.

        Section 2.7    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who properly
shall have demanded payment of the fair value for such shares in accordance with the IBCA (collectively, the "Dissenters' Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of the IBCA, except that all Dissenters' Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their
rights as dissenting stockholders under the IBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right
to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of the certificate(s) that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, evidenced such shares. The Company shall give Acquiror: (a) prompt notice of any written demands for payment of fair value of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the IBCA and received by the Company relating to stockholders'
dissenters' rights; and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under the IBCA consistent with the obligations of the
Company thereunder. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, (x) make any payment with respect to such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle
any demand for payment of fair value or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair value or timely take any other action to perfect payment of
fair value rights in accordance with the IBCA.

Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Company SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to

        (b)   The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") are complete and
correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Company Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of
unaudited Company Financial Statements. As of the date hereof, CliftonLarsonAllen LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent registered public accountants of the Company.

        (c)   The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that the Company is required to file under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of December 31, 2016, to the Knowledge of the Company,
such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

        (d)   The Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) ("Internal Control Over Financial Reporting"). The Company's certifying officers have evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of
the Company under the Exchange Act (the "Company Evaluation Date"). The Company presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers
about the effectiveness of the Company's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Company Evaluation Date. Since the Company
Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in the Company's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

        (e)   The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2014, with all applicable federal or
state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and
documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any
amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before
the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

        Section 3.10    Loans; Loan Loss Reserve.     

        (a)   Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by the Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof (the
"Company Loans") reflected as an asset on any of the Company Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is evidenced by documentation that
is customary and legally sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of the Company, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named
therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

        (b)   All Company Loans originated or purchased by the Bank were made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of the Bank and in
the Ordinary Course of Business of the Bank. The Bank's interest in all Company Loans is free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other charge, and,
the Bank has complied in all material respects with all Legal Requirements relating to such Company Loans. There has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in
whole or in part, any Company Loan made to an executive officer or director of the Company or the Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or director
during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof.

        (c)   Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists, as of December 31, 2016, each Company Loan: (i) under the terms of which the obligor is more
than ninety (90) days delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in default of any other material provision as of the dates shown thereon or for which the Bank has
discontinued the accrual of interest; (ii) that has been classified as "substandard," "doubtful," "loss," "other loans especially mentioned" or any comparable classifications
by the Bank; (iii) that has been listed on any "watch list" or similar internal report of the Bank; (iv) that has been the subject of any notice from any obligor of adverse
environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of any collateral for such Company Loan; (v) with respect to which the Bank has Knowledge of potential
violations of any Environmental Laws that may have occurred on the property serving as collateral for such Company Loan or by any obligor of such Company Loan; or
(vi) that represents an extension of credit to an executive officer or director of the Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or director.

        (d)   The Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Company Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis of the
Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Company Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established in a manner
consistent with the Bank's internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of the Bank, was adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all
Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Company Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding Company Loans.

        (e)   To the Knowledge of the Company: (i) none of the Company Loans is subject to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances in

awards as of the date hereof, (B) the number of outstanding awards held by each recipient as of the date hereof and (C) the form of award agreement pursuant to
which each such outstanding award was issued or otherwise granted.

        (b)   Except as set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or acceleration of
benefits or benefit entitlements under any Company Benefit Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary under any Company Benefit
Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan provides for payment of any amount which, considered in the aggregate
with amounts payable pursuant to all other Company Benefit Plans, would result in any amount being non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of
Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

        (c)   Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, administered or
contributed to, or has, has had or, could have any liability with respect to, (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii) any "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (iii) except as set forth in Section 3.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, any self-
insured plan (including any plan pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan"
(as described in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional employer organization, such Company Benefit Plan complies in all respects with
the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or remittance
of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled individuals. Neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA Affiliates sponsors, maintains,
administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any liability with respect to, any Company
Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA). No Company Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

        (d)   Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination letter, or,
in the case of a volume submitter or prototype plan, an advisory or sponsor letter, from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and that its related
funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code (or the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype
sponsor), and, to the Company's Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan or the tax-
exempt status of any related trust.

        (e)   Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements.

        (f)    Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plan
that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related agreement.

        (g)   No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other person

times since January 1, 2014, has been, in compliance with each Legal Requirement that is or was applicable to it or to the conduct or operation of its respective businesses or the
ownership or use of any of its respective assets, except where noncompliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, at any time since January 1, 2014, any notice or other communication (whether oral or written) from any Regulatory Authority or any
other Person regarding: (a) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement; or (b) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential obligation on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of any nature in connection
with a failure to comply with any Legal Requirement.

of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, Proceedings against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no Order imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to the Surviving Entity or

to dispose of such investment at any time. With respect to all material repurchase agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, the Company or
such Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the securities or other collateral securing each such repurchase
agreement, and the value of the collateral securing each such repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured by such collateral under such
agreement.

        (c)   None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has sold or otherwise disposed of any Company Investment Securities in a transaction in which the acquiror of such
Company Investment Securities or other person has the right, either conditionally or absolutely, to require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase or
otherwise reacquire any such Company Investment Securities.

        (d)   All Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable Legal Requirements of
applicable Regulatory Authorities and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and procedures
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and with counterparties believed at the time to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in
consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of such Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity), and are in full force and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

        Section 3.26    No Other Representations or Warranties.     

        (a)   Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Article 3, neither the Company nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, and the Company hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither the Company
nor any other Person makes or has made any representation or warranty to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or representatives with respect to: (i) any financial projection,
forecast, estimate, budget or prospective information relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses; or (ii) except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this Article 3, any oral or written information presented to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or representatives in the course of
their due diligence investigation of the Company, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (b)   The Company acknowledges and agrees that neither Acquiror nor any other Person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty
other than those contained in Article 4.

respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the

an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the
Acquiror SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Acquiror is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

        (b)   The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the "Acquiror Financial Statements") are complete and
correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of
unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements. As of the date hereof, RSM US LLP has not resigned (or informed Acquiror that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent registered public accountants of Acquiror.

        (c)   Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries.
Acquiror maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Acquiror's management to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of December 31, 2016, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, such controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

        (d)   Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquiror's certifying officers
have evaluated the effectiveness of Acquiror's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on
Form 10-Q of Acquiror under the Exchange Act (the "Acquiror Evaluation Date"). Acquiror presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers
about the effectiveness of Acquiror's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Acquiror Evaluation Date. Since the Acquiror
Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Acquiror's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, Acquiror's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquiror has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences.

        (e)   Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2014, with all applicable federal or state
securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and
documents: (i) complied as to form in all material

contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to
modify information as of an earlier date.

        (f)    To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2014 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank is not
an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r).

        Section 4.8    Books and Records.     The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are complete and correct in
all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with Acquiror's business practices and all applicable Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate
system of internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and transactions
included therein.

        Section 4.9    Properties.     Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible,
that it purports to own, other than OREO, subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind except: (i) as noted in the most recent Acquiror
Financial Statements and incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the most recent Acquiror Financial Statements; (ii) statutory liens for Taxes not yet
delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established and reflected in the Acquiror Financial
Statements; (iii) pledges or liens required to be granted in connection with the acceptance of government deposits, granted in connection with repurchase or reverse repurchase
agreements, securing any discount with, borrowing from, or obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank, interbank credit facilities or any transaction
by Acquiror Bank acting in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business; (iv) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do
not materially affect the present use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair the present business operations at such properties;
(v) minor defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held as of the date of this
Agreement; (vi) liens or deposits in connection with worker's compensation, unemployment insurance, social security or other insurance; (vii) inchoate mechanic's and
materialmen's liens for construction in progress and workmen's, repairmen's, warehousemen's and carrier's liens arising in the Ordinary Course of Business of Acquiror or
Acquiror Bank consistent with past practice; (viii) liens existing on any asset of any Person at the time such Person is acquired by or is combined with Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries, provided the lien was not created in contemplation of that event; (ix) liens on property required by Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve; and (x) liens
incidental to the conduct of business or ownership of property of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries which do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value of the
property or materially impair the use thereof as of the date of this Agreement. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and existing leases to
occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge
of Acquiror, the lessor.

        Section 4.10    Loans; Loan Loss Reserve.     

        (a)   Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by Acquiror Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension
thereof (the "Acquiror Loans") reflected as an asset on any of the Acquiror Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is evidenced by
documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

        (b)   All Acquiror Loans originated or purchased by Acquiror Bank were made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of Acquiror
Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of Acquiror Bank. Acquiror Bank's interest in all Acquiror Loans is free and clear of any security interest, lien,
encumbrance or other charge, and, Acquiror Bank has complied in all material respects with all Legal Requirements relating to such Acquiror Loans. There has been no
default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any Acquiror Loan made to an executive officer or director of Acquiror or Acquiror Bank or an entity
controlled by an executive officer or director during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof.

        (c)   Acquiror Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis of
Acquiror Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Acquiror Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established in a
manner consistent with Acquiror Bank's internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material respects under the requirements
of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding
Acquiror Loans.

        (d)   To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances in excess
of Acquiror Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except as limited above) and all
uncollectible loans have been charged off.

        Section 4.11    Taxes.     

        (a)   Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, and
each such Tax Return was true, correct and complete in all material respects when filed. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have paid, or made adequate provision for
the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not reflected in Tax Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due
and payable by any Regulatory Authority, and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except such Taxes as are being contested in good faith and as to which
adequate reserves have been provided.

        (b)   There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that they owe. No
audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or payable by Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted or, to the Knowledge of
Acquiror, threatened by any Regulatory Authority. Neither Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return,
and there are no liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of Acquiror's or its Subsidiaries' assets. Neither Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries has

avoidance or evasion of U.S. federal income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662, 6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or of the regulations of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder or pursuant to notices or other guidance published by the IRS (irrespective of the effective dates).

        Section 4.12    Employee Benefits.     

        (a)   Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of
employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Acquiror Benefit Plan or any
other increase in the liabilities of Acquiror or any Subsidiary under any Acquiror Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (b)   With respect to any Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a
professional employer organization, such Acquiror Benefit Plan complies in all respects with the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither Acquiror nor any of
the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled individuals.
Neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, administered or
contributed to, or has, has had or could have any liability with respect to, any Acquiror Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, or any tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Acquiror Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present
value of accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

        (c)   Each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination letter, or,
in the case of a volume submitter or prototype plan, an advisory or sponsor letter, from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and that its related
funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code (or Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype
sponsor), and, to Acquiror's Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any Acquiror Benefit Plan or the tax-
exempt status of any related trust.

        (d)   Each Acquiror Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements.

        (e)   Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to Acquiror's Knowledge,
threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Acquiror Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Acquiror Benefit Plan that alleges a
violation of applicable state or federal law or violation of any Acquiror Benefit Plan document or related agreement.

(a) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement; or (b) any actual, alleged, possible, or potential obligation on the part
of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any remedial action of any nature in connection with a failure to comply with any

of; any Regulatory Authority that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business, in any manner relates to its capital adequacy, restricts its ability to
pay dividends or interest or limits in any material manner its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, none of
the foregoing has been threatened by any Regulatory Authority.

        Section 4.15    Absence of Certain Changes and Events.     Since December 31, 2015, no event or events have occurred that had or would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror.

        Section 4.16    Compliance with Environmental Laws.     There are no actions, suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders involving Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that are pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, nor to the Knowledge of Acquiror, is there any factual basis for
any of the foregoing, as a result of any asserted failure of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries of, or any predecessor thereof, to comply with any Environmental Law. No
environmental clearances or other governmental approvals are required for the conduct of the business of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of Acquiror, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any interest in real estate, other than OREO, on which
any substances have been generated, used, stored, deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known to be present on, at or under such property, would
require notification to any Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted adjacent or
down gradient property, except where such action would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. Except for any matters that have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, Acquiror and each Subsidiary of Acquiror has complied in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to it and its business operations.

or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, has incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders' fees or agents'
commissions or other similar payment in connection with this Agreement.

        Section 4.18    Approval Delays.     To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals would be denied or
unduly delayed. Acquiror Bank's most recent CRA rating was "satisfactory" or better.

        Section 4.19    Financial Capability.     Acquiror has, and will have prior to the Effective Time, sufficient funds to pay the Cash Consideration and the consideration to be
paid to the holders of the Director Company Stock Options and other Company Equity Awards in accordance with Section 2.5 and to perform its other obligations contemplated
by this Agreement.

        (a)   Except for the representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this Article 4, neither Acquiror nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Acquiror, its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, and Acquiror hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither Acquiror nor any
other Person makes or has made any representation or warranty to the Company or any of its Affiliates or representatives with respect to: (i) any financial projection,

other than those contained in Article 3.

notice, have such reasonable access to the facilities, operations, records and properties of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 5.1(a) as shall be necessary for the purpose of determining the Company's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
preparing for the integration of Acquiror and the Company following the Effective Time. Acquiror and its Representatives may, during such period, make or cause to be
made such reasonable investigation of the operations, records and properties of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal

investigation shall not interfere materially with the normal operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon request, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
will furnish Acquiror or its Representatives attorneys' responses to auditors' requests for information regarding the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and
such financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested by Acquiror (provided, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege). No investigation by Acquiror or any of its Representatives shall affect the representations and warranties
made by the Company in this Agreement. This Section 5.1(a) shall not require the disclosure of any information to Acquiror the disclosure of which, in the Company's
reasonable judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii) would result in the breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on the
date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened litigation or investigations, if disclosure might affect the confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to,
the matters being discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply, the Company and Acquiror will make appropriate alternative disclosure
arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal
Requirement.

        (b)   From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly furnish
to Acquiror: (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal and state banking laws or federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on the SEC's EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy
of each report filed by it or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory
or examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement.

portions of such documents: (i) relating to confidential supervisory or examination materials, (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement,

Approval is obtained, the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith it is reasonably likely that to, or to continue to, recommend this
Agreement to its stockholders would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, then the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to make a Company Adverse Recommendation.

        Section 5.5    Information Provided to Acquiror.     The Company agrees that the information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or to be
provided by the Company to Acquiror for inclusion or that is included in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement and any other documents to be filed with any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the Contemplated Transactions will: (a) at the respective times such documents are filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective and, with respect to the Proxy Statement, when mailed, not be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, not be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the meeting in connection with which the Proxy Statement shall
be mailed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any information with respect to Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates contained in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement or in any document submitted to, or other communication with, any
Regulatory Authority.

later date as the parties may mutually agree.

        Section 5.7    Company Benefit Plans.     

        (a)   At the request of Acquiror, except as otherwise provided by Section 2.5(a)(i), the Company will take all appropriate action to amend or terminate, prior to the
Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan, provided however, that no action taken by the Company with respect to the termination of a Company Benefit Plan shall be
required to be irrevocable until one day prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall accrue the costs associated with any payments due under any Company Benefit Plan, including without
limitation any change of control or severance agreements, retention or stay bonus programs, or other similar arrangements, consistent with GAAP.

        Section 5.8    Acquisition Proposals.     

        (a)   The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with
any Persons other than Acquiror with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will within two (2) Business Days advise Acquiror following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Acquiror apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a reasonably current basis.

        (b)   The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not
to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting a Person for the sole purpose of
seeking clarification of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal); provided that, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal from a Person other than Acquiror after the execution of this Agreement, and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering the advice of outside counsel, that failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, the Company may: (i) furnish
information with respect to it to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (subject to the requirement that any
such information not previously provided to Acquiror shall be promptly furnished to Acquiror); (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; and (iii) terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.8 unless and until (x) five (5) Business Days have elapsed following the delivery to the other party
of a written notice of such determination by the Company Board and, during such five (5) Business-Day period, the parties cooperate with one another with the intent of
enabling the parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that the Contemplated Transactions may be effected, and (y) at the end of such five (5) Business-Day period,
the Company continues, in good faith and after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to believe that a Superior Proposal continues to exist.

otherwise have under this Agreement.

ACQUIROR'S COVENANTS 

        Section 6.1    Access and Investigation.     

        (a)   Subject to any applicable Legal Requirement, the Company and its Representatives shall, at all times during normal business hours and with reasonable advance
notice, have such reasonable access to the facilities, operations, records and properties of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 6.1(a) as shall be necessary for the purpose of determining Acquiror's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Company and
its Representatives may, during such period, make or cause to be made such reasonable investigation of the operations, records and properties of Acquiror and each of its
Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal conditions as Company shall deem necessary or advisable to familiarize itself with such records, properties and
other matters; provided, however, that such access or investigation shall not interfere materially with the normal operations of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon
request, Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries will furnish the Company or its Representatives attorneys' responses to auditors' requests for information regarding
Acquiror or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested by the Company (provided, such
disclosure would not result in the waiver by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege). No investigation by the Company or any of its
Representatives shall affect the representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this Agreement. This Section 6.1(a) shall not require the disclosure of any
information to the Company the disclosure of which, in Acquiror's reasonable judgment: (i) would be prohibited by any applicable Legal Requirement; (ii) would result in
the breach of any agreement with any third party in effect on the date of this Agreement; or (iii) relate to pending or threatened litigation or investigations, if disclosure
might affect the confidential nature of, or any privilege relating to, the matters being discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply, Acquiror
and the Company will make appropriate alternative disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive
material and to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal Requirement.

        (b)   From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Acquiror shall promptly furnish to
the Company: (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, furnished or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal and state banking laws or federal or state securities laws, which is not generally available on the SEC's EDGAR internet database; and (ii) a copy
of each report filed by it or any of its Subsidiaries with any Regulatory Authority; in each case other than portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory
or examination materials or the disclosure of which would violate any applicable Legal Requirement.

including the Contemplated Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Acquiror shall also advance expenses incurred by an
Indemnified Party in each such case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, subject to the receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified
Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not

Effective Time).

        (c)   If Acquiror or any of its successors or assigns shall: (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation

        (a)   All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing ("Covered Employees") shall automatically become
employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of
Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of

Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; provided, however, that: (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen Acquiror
Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee's continued
participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit
Plans may commence at different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan).

        (b)   For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods (but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans
providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any applicable Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

        (c)   In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that:
(i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
similar in type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Company
Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar
benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible
expenses were incurred during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

        (d)   The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company's severance policies immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.6(e), following the Effective Time, Acquiror or Acquiror's Subsidiary will cause any eligible Company employee (exempt and non-
exempt) to be covered by a severance policy under which employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of employment will be eligible to receive severance
pay in accordance with the severance pay schedule set forth on Section 7.6(d) of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company
employee eligible to receive severance benefits or other payment triggered by the Merger under an employment, change in control, severance or other agreement (a "CIC
Payment") shall be entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this Section 7.6(d) or to otherwise receive severance benefits. Any Company employee
who waives and relinquishes his or her right to a CIC Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in this Section 7.6(d).

        (e)   Any Company employee who has or is party to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or
arrangement that provides for a CIC Payment shall not receive any severance benefits as provided in Section 7.6(d) but will receive the CIC Payment to the extent it is
required to be paid under such agreement, provided that, on or before the Closing Date, the Company will take all steps necessary to ensure that in the event that the
amounts of the CIC Payment, either individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any other plan, agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for
purposes of Code Section 280G (in the aggregate "Total Payments"), would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
that is subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts of the CIC Payment shall be reduced such that the value of the Total Payments that each
counterparty is entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the maximum amount which the counterparty may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax or
resulting in a disallowance of a deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G of the Code.

        Section 7.7    Takeover Laws.     If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Legal Requirement
is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Legal Requirement on the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 7.8    Section 16 Matters.     Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (a) any disposition of
shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions or dispositions of Acquiror Common Stock resulting
from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

        Section 7.9    Stockholder Litigation.     Each of the Company and Acquiror shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the defense of any
stockholder litigation against the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Contemplated Transactions.

hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

obtained; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, there may not be, without further approval of the Company's stockholders, any

contained in this Agreement which are for the benefit of the waiving party. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in

documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as provided in Article 10, the rights and
remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements: (x) no claim or right arising

in writing signed by the other party; (y) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (z) no notice to or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice

Appendix B 

Sections 11.65 and 11.70 of the Illinois Business Corporation Act 

§ 11.65. Right to Dissent.

        (a)   A shareholder of a corporation is entitled to dissent from, and obtain payment for his or her shares in the event of any of the following corporate actions:

        (1)   consummation of a plan of merger or consolidation or a plan of share exchange to which the corporation is a party if (i) shareholder authorization is required for
the merger or consolidation or the share exchange by Section 11.20 or the articles of incorporation or (ii) the corporation is a subsidiary that is merged with its parent or
another subsidiary under Section 11.30;

        (2)   consummation of a sale, lease or exchange of all, or substantially all, of the property and assets of the corporation other than in the usual and regular course of
business;

        (3)   an amendment of the articles of incorporation that materially and adversely affects rights in respect of a dissenter's shares because it:

          (i)  alters or abolishes a preferential right of such shares;

         (ii)  alters or abolishes a right in respect of redemption, including a provision respecting a sinking fund for the redemption or repurchase, of such shares;

        (iii)  in the case of a corporation incorporated prior to January 1, 1982, limits or eliminates cumulative voting rights with respect to such shares; or

        (4)   any other corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote if the articles of incorporation, by-laws, or a resolution of the board of directors provide that
shareholders are entitled to dissent and obtain payment for their shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.70 or as may be otherwise provided in the
articles, by-laws or resolution.

        (b)   A shareholder entitled to dissent and obtain payment for his or her shares under this Section may not challenge the corporate action creating his or her entitlement
unless the action is fraudulent with respect to the shareholder or the corporation or constitutes a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the shareholder.

        (c)   A record owner of shares may assert dissenters' rights as to fewer than all the shares recorded in such person's name only if such person dissents with respect to all
shares beneficially owned by any one person and notifies the corporation in writing of the name and address of each person on whose behalf the record owner asserts dissenters'
rights. The rights of a partial dissenter are determined as if the shares as to which dissent is made and the other shares were recorded in the names of different shareholders. A
beneficial owner of shares who is not the record owner may assert dissenters' rights as to shares held on such person's behalf only if the beneficial owner submits to the
corporation the record owner's written consent to the dissent before or at the same time the beneficial owner asserts dissenters' rights.

§ 11.70. Procedure to Dissent.

        (a)   If the corporate action giving rise to the right to dissent is to be approved at a meeting of shareholders, the notice of meeting shall inform the shareholders of their right
to dissent and the procedure to dissent. If, prior to the meeting, the corporation furnishes to the shareholders material information with respect to the transaction that will
objectively enable a shareholder to vote on the transaction and to determine whether or not to exercise dissenters' rights, a shareholder may assert dissenters' rights only if the
shareholder delivers to the corporation before the vote is taken a written

demand for payment for his or her shares if the proposed action is consummated, and the shareholder does not vote in favor of the proposed action.

        (b)   If the corporate action giving rise to the right to dissent is not to be approved at a meeting of shareholders, the notice to shareholders describing the action taken under
Section 11.30 or Section 7.10 shall inform the shareholders of their right to dissent and the procedure to dissent. If, prior to or concurrently with the notice, the corporation
furnishes to the shareholders material information with respect to the transaction that will objectively enable a shareholder to determine whether or not to exercise dissenters'
rights, a shareholder may assert dissenter's rights only if he or she delivers to the corporation within 30 days from the date of mailing the notice a written demand for payment for
his or her shares.

        (c)   Within 10 days after the date on which the corporate action giving rise to the right to dissent is effective or 30 days after the shareholder delivers to the corporation the
written demand for payment, whichever is later, the corporation shall send each shareholder who has delivered a written demand for payment a statement setting forth the opinion
of the corporation as to the estimated fair value of the shares, the corporation's latest balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not earlier than 16 months before the
delivery of the statement, together with the statement of income for that year and the latest available interim financial statements, and either a commitment to pay for the shares
of the dissenting shareholder at the estimated fair value thereof upon transmittal to the corporation of the certificate or certificates, or other evidence of ownership, with respect to
the shares, or instructions to the dissenting shareholder to sell his or her shares within 10 days after delivery of the corporation's statement to the shareholder. The corporation
may instruct the shareholder to sell only if there is a public market for the shares at which the shares may be readily sold. If the shareholder does not sell within that 10 day period
after being so instructed by the corporation, for purposes of this Section the shareholder shall be deemed to have sold his or her shares at the average closing price of the shares, if
listed on a national exchange, or the average of the bid and asked price with respect to the shares quoted by a principal market maker, if not listed on a national exchange, during
that 10 day period.

        (d)   A shareholder who makes written demand for payment under this Section retains all other rights of a shareholder until those rights are cancelled or modified by the
consummation of the proposed corporate action. Upon consummation of that action, the corporation shall pay to each dissenter who transmits to the corporation the certificate or
other evidence of ownership of the shares the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of the shares, plus accrued interest, accompanied by a written explanation of
how the interest was calculated.

        (e)   If the shareholder does not agree with the opinion of the corporation as to the estimated fair value of the shares or the amount of interest due, the shareholder, within
30 days from the delivery of the corporation's statement of value, shall notify the corporation in writing of the shareholder's estimated fair value and amount of interest due and
demand payment for the difference between the shareholder's estimate of fair value and interest due and the amount of the payment by the corporation or the proceeds of sale by
the shareholder, whichever is applicable because of the procedure for which the corporation opted pursuant to subsection (c).

        (f)    If, within 60 days from delivery to the corporation of the shareholder notification of estimate of fair value of the shares and interest due, the corporation and the
dissenting shareholder have not agreed in writing upon the fair value of the shares and interest due, the corporation shall either pay the difference in value demanded by the
shareholder, with interest, or file a petition in the circuit court of the county in which either the registered office or the principal office of the corporation is located, requesting the
court to determine the fair value of the shares and interest due. The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this State, whose demands remain unsettled
parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares and all parties shall be served with a copy of the

petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law. Failure of the corporation to commence an action pursuant to this
Section shall not limit or affect the right of the dissenting shareholders to otherwise commence an action as permitted by law.

        (g)   The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (f) by a corporation is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more
persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the power described in the order appointing them, or in any
amendment to it.

        (h)   Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount, if any, by which the court finds that the fair value of his or her shares, plus
interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation or the proceeds of sale by the shareholder, whichever amount is applicable.

        (i)    The court, in a proceeding commenced under subsection (f), shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of the
appraisers, if any, appointed by the court under subsection (g), but shall exclude the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties. If the fair value of the
shares as determined by the court materially exceeds the amount which the corporation estimated to be the fair value of the shares or if no estimate was made in accordance with
subsection (c), then all or any part of the costs may be assessed against the corporation. If the amount which any dissenter estimated to be the fair value of the shares materially
exceeds the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, then all or any part of the costs may be assessed against that dissenter. The court may also assess the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable, as follows:

        (1)   Against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds that the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of
subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (f).

        (2)   Against either the corporation or a dissenter and in favor of any other party if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed
acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this Section.

If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated and that the fees for those services
should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to that counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded to the dissenters who
are benefited. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the practice, procedure, judgment and costs shall be governed by the Code of Civil Procedure.

        (j)    As used in this Section:

        (1)   "Fair value", with respect to a dissenter's shares, means the proportionate interest of the shareholder in the corporation, without discount for minority status or,
absent extraordinary circumstance, lack of marketability, immediately before the consummation of the corporate action to which the dissenter objects excluding any
appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action, unless exclusion would be inequitable.

        (2)   "Interest" means interest from the effective date of the corporate action until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid by the corporation on its
principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and equitable under all the circumstances.

        (b)   against any Acquisition Proposal involving any party other than Acquiror or an Affiliate of Acquiror; and

obligation of the Company under the Merger Agreement.

        Section 4.    Additional Covenants.    Except as required by law, each Principal Stockholder agrees that he or she will:

of or with respect to any of the Company Stock. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Company Stock shall remain and belong to the applicable
stockholder and Acquiror shall have no power or authority to direct any stockholder in the voting of any of the Company Stock or the performance by any stockholder of its
duties or responsibilities as a stockholder of the Company, except as otherwise provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a voting and support agreement only, and is
not to be interpreted as a written consent to the Merger or as granting Acquiror a proxy to vote the Company Stock subject to this Agreement.

qualified or adversely modified its recommendation to the stockholders of the Company that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
in each case because the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that to, or to continue to, recommend the

Appendix D 

February 6, 2017

Board of Directors
First Community Financial Partners, Inc.
2801 Black Road
Joliet, Illinois 60435

Dear Members of the Board:

        You have requested our opinion as investment bankers as to the fairness, from a financial perspective, to the common shareholders (the "Shareholders") of First Community
Financial Partners, Inc., Joliet, Illinois (the "Company"), along with its wholly owned subsidiary, First Community Financial Bank ("FCFB") of the proposed consideration to be
received by the Company's Shareholders in the proposed merger of the Company with and into First Busey Corporation ("BUSE"), a Nevada corporation and sole shareholder of
Busey Bank, Champaign, Illinois (the "Transaction"). In the Transaction, the Company's Shareholders will receive, per share, fixed consideration of $1.35 in cash and 0.396
shares of BUSE common stock (the "Per Share Consideration"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization by and among BUSE, Busey
Bank, the Company and FCFB. In aggregate, based upon 17,524,246 shares outstanding of the Company, the Shareholders will receive $23.7 million in cash and 6,939,601
shares of BUSE, representing consideration of $227.2 million based on the closing price of BUSE (NASDAQ: BUSE) as of February 6, 2017 of $29.33, or $239.2 million in total
aggregate consideration, including payments to option and warrant holders (collectively the "Merger Consideration").

        Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. The terms of the Transaction are set forth more fully in
the Agreement and descriptions of any such terms herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Agreement.

        FIG Partners LLC ("FIG"), as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bidding, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. As specialists in the securities of financial institutions, we have experience and knowledge of the valuation of banking institutions. As you are
aware, in the course of its daily trading activities, investment funds controlled by an affiliate (as such term is defined in Regulation 12G-2 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of FIG and its affiliates may from time to time effect transactions and hold securities of the Company or BUSE; to the extent that we have
any such position as of the date of this opinion it has been disclosed to the Company and BUSE. This opinion has been reviewed and approved by FIG's Fairness Committee. In
addition FIG has not had a material relationship with the Company for which we have received compensation during the prior two years. FIG has been engaged by BUSE for
which we have received compensation during the prior two years. FIG has profiled the Company in its Emerging Ideas since December 2015.

        We were retained by the Company to act as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the proposed Transaction and in rendering this fairness opinion. We will
receive compensation from the Company in connection with our services, including a fee for rendering this opinion and a fee that is

contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. The Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

        During the course of our engagement and for the purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

(i) reviewed the final draft of the Agreement dated February 6, 2017; 

(ii) reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company including, among other things, quarterly and annual
reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; 

(iii) reviewed certain historical publicly available business and financial information concerning the BUSE including, among other things, quarterly and annual reports
filed with the SEC, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; 

(iv) reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company and BUSE as well as analyzed pro forma
Regulatory capital levels; 

(v) utilized earnings per share estimates for the Company for the years ending December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2021, as provided by the senior management of
the Company; 

(vi) utilized publicly available median analyst earnings per share estimates for BUSE for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, and an estimated long-term
annual earnings per share growth rate for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of BUSE; 

(vii) used in its analyses certain assumptions related to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustment as well as certain cost savings. With respect to these
estimates, the senior management of the Company and BUSE confirmed to us that they reflected the best currently available estimates of the senior management
of the Company and BUSE; 

(viii) held discussions with members of the senior managements of the Company and BUSE for the purpose of reviewing the future prospects of the Company and
BUSE, including financial estimates related to their respective businesses, earnings, assets, and liabilities and credit quality; 

(ix) reviewed the terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions, to the extent publicly available, involving banks and bank holding companies that we considered
and deemed relevant; 

(x) reviewed trading activity in Company's and BUSE's common stock over the last twelve months relative to price and volume; 

(xi) reviewed Company's and BUSE's financial performance and current valuation metrics relative to other publicly traded banks which were deemed similar to
Company; and 

(xii) performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed relevant and appropriate.

        We have taken into account our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our experience in other transactions as well as our knowledge of the
banking industry and our general experience in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities.

        In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and representations
contained in the materials provided to us by the Company and BUSE and in the discussions with the Company and BUSE's management teams. We have not independently
verified the accuracy or completeness of any such

information. In that regard, we have assumed that the financial estimates, and estimates and allowances regarding under-performing and nonperforming assets and net charge-offs
have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available information, judgments and estimates of the Company and BUSE and that such estimates will be
realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby. We are not experts in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the
allowances for losses with respect thereto and have assumed and relied upon management's estimates and projections. We were not retained to and did not conduct a physical
inspection of any of the properties or facilities of the Company or BUSE or their respective subsidiaries. In addition, we have not reviewed individual credit files nor have we
made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the Company or BUSE nor any of their respective subsidiaries and we were not furnished with any
such evaluations or appraisals.

        We have assumed that the proposed Transaction will be consummated substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement. We have assumed that the
proposed Transaction is, and will be, in compliance with all laws and regulations that are applicable to the Company and BUSE. In rendering this opinion, we have been advised
by both the Company and BUSE that there are no known factors that could impede or cause any material delay in obtaining the necessary regulatory and governmental approvals
of the proposed Transaction.

        Our opinion is based solely upon the information available to us and the economic, market and other circumstances, as they exist as of the date hereof. Events occurring and
information that becomes available after the date hereof could materially affect the assumptions and analyses used in preparing this opinion. We have not undertaken to reaffirm
or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring or information that becomes available after the date hereof, except as otherwise agreed in our engagement
letter.

        Our opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed Transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any
Shareholder of the Company as to how such Shareholder should vote on the proposed Transaction or any other matter related thereto. We do not express any opinion as to the
fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the proposed Transaction by any officer, director, or employee, or class of such persons.

        This letter is solely for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company in its evaluation of the proposed Transaction and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or
otherwise referred to for any other purpose, nor is it to be filed with, included in or referred to in whole or in part in any proxy statement or any other document, except in each
case in accordance with our prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that we hereby consent to the inclusion and reference to this
letter in any proxy statement, information statement or tender offer document to be delivered to the Company's Shareholders in connection with the proposed Transaction if and
only if this letter is quoted in full or attached as an exhibit to such document.

        Subject to the foregoing and based on our experience as investment bankers, our activities and assumptions as described above, and all other factors we have considered and
deemed relevant, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be received by the Shareholders of the Company under the Agreement is fair from a
financial perspective.
