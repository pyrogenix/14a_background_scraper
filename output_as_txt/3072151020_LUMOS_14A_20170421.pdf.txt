Dear Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Lumos Networks Corp., which we refer to as
“Lumos Networks” or the “Company,” which will be held at 9:00 a.m. (local time) on May 24, 2017, at the offices of Troutman
Sanders LLP, 1001 Haxall Point, 15th Floor, Richmond, Virginia. We will conduct the business ordinarily held at our annual meeting,
which is listed in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

In addition, on February 18, 2017, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to as the “Merger
Agreement,” with MTN Infrastructure TopCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as “Parent,” and MTN Infrastructure
BidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, which we refer to as “Merger Sub,” pursuant to which,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, which we refer to as the “Merger.” At the
2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we will ask you to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby
approving the Merger, and certain other Merger-related matters as set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders
and the accompanying proxy statement. If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $18.00 in cash for each share of
Lumos Networks common stock, par value $0.01 per share, which we refer to as the “Lumos Networks Common Stock,” that you own.

Adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders. After considering various factors, all members of our Board of Directors voting on the Merger determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are in the best interests of Lumos Networks’
stockholders, and approved and adopted and declared advisable, the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

You may read, print and download our annual report on Form 10-K and proxy statement at
http://www.envisionreports.com/LMOS.

If you do not attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we request that you vote by telephone or Internet, or if you
received a paper copy of the proxy card by mail, by signing your proxy card and mailing it in the envelope provided. The proxy card
materials provide you with details on how to vote by these three methods. The prompt vote by telephone or Internet or return of your
proxy card will be appreciated. If you decide to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, you may revoke your proxy and
personally cast your vote.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. We cannot consummate the Merger unless the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting vote in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. If you fail to vote on the Merger Agreement or fail to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee on how to vote, the effect will be the same as a vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

The Merger (page 33)

Certain Effects of the Merger on Lumos Networks (page 34)

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lumos Networks,
with Lumos Networks continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger,
Lumos Networks will cease to be a publicly traded company, and the directors of Merger Sub will continue as the directors of the
surviving corporation. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term surviving corporation to refer to Lumos Networks as the
surviving corporation following the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the
surviving corporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in “The Merger—Merger
Consideration” beginning on page 34 (unless you have properly demanded appraisal for your shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as amended, which we refer to as the “DGCL,” in which case you will be entitled only to those rights granted under
Section 262 of the DGCL as described below under “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 76).

Table of Contents

The time at which the Merger will become effective, which we refer to as the effective time of the Merger, will occur upon the
filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as we and Parent may
agree and specify in the certificate of merger).

Effect on Lumos Networks if the Merger is Not Completed (page 34)

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Lumos Networks stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
Lumos Networks stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. Instead, Lumos
Networks will remain a public company, Lumos Networks Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ,
and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the “Exchange Act,” and we will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, Lumos Networks may be required to pay Parent a
termination fee, or may be entitled to receive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement,
as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 114.

Merger Consideration (page 34)

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than (i) shares held by
Lumos Networks as treasury stock, held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Lumos Networks or of Parent (other
than Merger Sub) or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub, which we refer to as “cancelled shares;” and (ii) shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the Merger and who are entitled to demand and
have properly demanded appraisal with respect to such shares, in accordance with and who comply in all respects with Delaware
law, which we refer to as “dissenting shares”) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.00 in cash, which
amount we refer to as the “Merger Consideration,” without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. All shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist at the effective time of the Merger, and each certificate formerly representing such shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock
will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Lumos Investment Holdings, Ltd., an affiliate of Pamplona Capital Management, which we refer to as “Pamplona,” the holder of a
warrant to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock dated August 5, 2015, which we refer to as the “Warrant,” has agreed,
subject to the effectiveness of the Merger, to exercise the Warrant. Upon exercise, Pamplona will receive 1,225,278 shares of
Lumos Networks Common Stock that will be exchanged for the Merger Consideration.

After the Merger is completed, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a Lumos Networks stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that
stockholders who hold dissenting shares will not have the right to receive the Merger Consideration but will have the right to
receive instead a payment for the “fair value” of their dissenting shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant
to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described below under “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 76).

Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards (page 64)

The Merger Agreement provides for the following treatment of equity and equity-based awards relating to Lumos Networks
Common Stock:

Stock Options

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each option to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock (whether or not
vested and exercisable) that is then outstanding will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof,
vest and be cancelled and entitle the option holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock subject to the option and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration
exceeds the applicable exercise price per share of Lumos Networks Common Stock underlying the option (less any applicable
withholding taxes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of seven business days

Table of Contents

prior to the closing of the Merger (and conditional on the closing), each holder of an outstanding and unexercised option to
purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock will be entitled to exercise such option and shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock
received upon such exercise will be treated the same as other outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger.

Restricted Stock

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each share of Lumos Networks Common Stock which is subject to vesting or
other lapse restrictions, which is referred to in the Merger Agreement as Company restricted stock, that is then outstanding will
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and the restrictions thereon will lapse and
entitle the holder of such share of Company restricted stock to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding
taxes and in accordance with the same terms and conditions applied to holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock generally.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Each right to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan that was outstanding
as of February 18, 2017, and remains outstanding will automatically be exercised on a purchase date specified with respect to that
purchase right under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan and related award agreement. If such purchase date is on or
before the effective time of the Merger, the holder of that purchase right will receive shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan and if the purchase date is after the effective time of the
Merger, the holder of that purchase right will receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and
(ii) the number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that would have otherwise been delivered with respect to that
purchase right.

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (page 46)

All members of our Board voting on the Merger, after consulting with Lumos Networks’ outside legal counsel, Troutman Sanders
LLP, which we refer to as “Troutman Sanders,” and financial advisors, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, which we refer to as “Wells
Fargo Securities,” and UBS Securities LLC, which we refer to as “UBS,” and, together with Wells Fargo Securities, the “Financial
Advisors,” and after review and consideration of various factors described in the section below entitled “The Merger—
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger—Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 47, (i)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by Lumos Networks of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Lumos Networks
and its stockholders, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Lumos Networks for adoption
and (iv) declared that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable.

The Board recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the merger proposal and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger; (ii) “FOR” the adjournment proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Merger-related named
executive officer compensation proposal.

Opinions of Financial Advisors (page 50)

Lumos Networks engaged Wells Fargo Securities and UBS to act as its financial advisors to advise the Board in connection with
the Merger. On February 18, 2017, Wells Fargo Securities rendered its oral opinion to the Board (which was subsequently
confirmed in writing by delivery of Wells Fargo Securities’ written opinion addressed to the Board dated February 18, 2017), as of
February 18, 2017, that, based upon and subject to the full text of Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion, including various assumptions
and limitations contained therein, its experience as an investment bank, its work as described in its opinion and other factors Wells
Fargo Securities deemed relevant, the Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of Lumos Networks
Common Stock (other than Parent and Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, as of the
date of Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion, from a

financial point of view, to such holders. On February 18, 2017, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the Merger, UBS
delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated
February 18, 2017, to the effect that, as of February 18, 2017 and based on and subject to various assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations described in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of
Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than holders of dissenting shares, Parent and Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries) was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The summary of Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of its written opinion, which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and describes the procedures followed,
assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered by Wells Fargo
Securities in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion nor the
summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement are intended to be, and do not constitute,
advice or a recommendation to our Board or any other person or entity in respect of the Merger or otherwise, including,
without limitation, as to how any holder of Lumos Networks Common Stock or any other person should vote or act in
connection with any matter relating to the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any other matters.

The full text of UBS’s written opinion to the Board describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by UBS. This opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E
and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock are encouraged to
read this opinion carefully in its entirety. UBS’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such)
in connection with, and for the purpose of, the Boards’ evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than holders of dissenting shares, Parent and Lumos Networks and its
subsidiaries) of the Merger Consideration, and did not address any other aspect or implication of the Merger or the Merger
Agreement, including, without limitation, the relative merits of the Merger or any related transaction as compared to other
business strategies or transactions that might be available with respect to Lumos Networks, or Lumos Networks’
underlying business decision to effect the Merger or any related transaction. UBS’s opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Lumos Networks Commons Stock as to how such holder should vote or act with respect
to the Merger or any related transaction.

Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger (page 64)

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, you should be aware that certain of
our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as
a stockholder generally. The members of the Board voting on the Merger were also aware of these interests in, among other
matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the
stockholders of Lumos Networks. See the sections entitled “Merger—Background of the Merger” and “Merger—Recommendation
of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on pages 35 and 46, respectively. You should take these interests
into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

These interests are described in more detail below, including the compensation that may become payable in connection with the
Merger to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Timothy G. Biltz, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
Johan G. Broekhuysen, our Senior Vice President and General Manager of our residential and small business, or “R&SB,”
segment, Diego B. Anderson, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Thomas E. Ferry, and our Senior Vice
President and General Counsel, Mary McDermott, who constitute our named executive officers, which is subject to a non-binding,
advisory vote of Lumos Networks’ stockholders and is quantified in the narrative below and under the heading “Proposal 3:
Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation” beginning on page 123. The dates used below to
quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain
events will occur.

Table of Contents

Financing of the Merger (page 73)

Parent estimates that the total amount required to complete the Merger and the related transactions and to pay related fees and
expenses will be approximately $1,003 million. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following:
 

 

•  Debt Financing. Debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $485 million of senior secured first lien term loans
as well as a committed $50 million senior secured revolving facility. In the event additional revolving commitments are
obtained prior to the closing of the Merger, the amount of the revolving credit facility may be increased to up to $75
million. Parent has received firm commitments from a consortium of financial institutions to provide the debt financing
and revolving credit facility. See the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger—Debt Financing”
beginning on page 73; and

 

 
•  Equity Financing. Equity financing to be provided by EQT Infrastructure III SCSp, which we refer to as the “EQT

Fund,” in an aggregate amount of up to $517.9 million to be funded at the closing of the Merger. See the section entitled
“The Merger—Financing of the Merger—Equity Financing” beginning on page 74.

The consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition (although the funding of the equity financing and the debt
financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the applicable commitment letter under which such financing
will be provided).

Termination Equity Commitment Letter (page 75)

Parent has received a commitment letter, which we refer to as the “termination equity commitment letter,” from the EQT Fund
pursuant to which the EQT Fund has committed to provide funds to Parent for the purpose of paying the parent termination fee if
the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company under certain specified circumstances (see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 114). The obligation of the EQT Fund under the termination equity
commitment letter with respect to the parent termination fee is subject to an aggregate cap equal to the amount of $32.1 million,
plus certain costs and expenses of enforcement, if applicable. See the section entitled “The Merger—Termination Equity
Commitment Letter” beginning on page 75.

Appraisal Rights (page 76)

If the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger becomes effective, holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock who do not
vote their shares in favor of the Merger will be entitled to statutory appraisal rights if they strictly comply with Section 262 of the
DGCL. This means that such stockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of his, her or its shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock
and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of his, her or its shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an
appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount a holder would have received under the Merger
Agreement. For a description of the rights of such holders and of the procedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and
obtain payment of the fair value of their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, see “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 76 and the text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Appendix B, as well as the
information set forth below.

IN ORDER TO PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, YOU MUST
DELIVER A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL TO LUMOS NETWORKS BEFORE THE VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, MUST NOT VOTE, IN PERSON OR BY
PROXY, IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL AND MUST CONTINUE TO HOLD THE SHARES OF LUMOS
NETWORKS COMMON STOCK OF RECORD FROM THE DATE OF MAKING THE DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL
THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE TIME. AS SUCH, MERELY VOTING AGAINST, OR ABSTAINING OR FAILING TO VOTE
ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL WILL NOT PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPRAISAL UNDER THE DGCL. BECAUSE A
PROXY THAT IS SIGNED AND SUBMITTED BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE CONTAIN VOTING INSTRUCTIONS WILL,
UNLESS REVOKED, BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL, IF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO
EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU MUST INCLUDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE YOUR SHARES OF
LUMOS NETWORKS COMMON STOCK AGAINST OR ABSTAIN WITH RESPECT TO THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

THE MERGER PROPOSAL, NOR ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL,
WILL IN AND OF ITSELF CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS
OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. THE WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL MUST BE IN ADDITION TO AND
SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF LUMOS
NETWORKS COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO
EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER
NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL
BY SUCH BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE. IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DGCL,
STOCKHOLDERS WHO MAY WISH TO PURSUE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR LEGAL AND
FINANCIAL ADVISORS PROMPTLY.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 81)

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger—U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 81) in exchange for such U.S. holder’s shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the
difference between the cash such U.S. holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
Lumos Networks Common Stock surrendered in the Merger. A non-U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger—U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 81) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of Lumos Networks Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such non-U.S. holder has certain
connections to the United States (as described in “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning
on page 81) or Lumos Networks is, or was during the relevant period, treated as a United States real property holding corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders should refer to the discussion in the section entitled “The Merger—U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 81, and consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the
laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 84)

Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the “HSR Act,” has expired or been terminated. Lumos
Networks and Parent filed their respective HSR Act premerger notifications on March 3, 2017 with the Federal Trade Commission,
which we refer to as the “FTC,” and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the “DOJ,” under the
HSR Act. The HSR waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. on April 3, 2017.

While the HSR Act review has been completed in a timely manner, there is no certainty that a regulatory challenge to the Merger
will not subsequently be made.

Federal Communications Commission Approval

Lumos Networks is also subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, which we refer to as the “FCC,” under
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the “Communications Act.” Lumos Networks holds a number
of FCC authorizations related to the provision of regulated services. FCC approval is required before Lumos Networks may
transfer control of its authorizations to Parent. The FCC will not issue its approval until it receives the consent of certain executive
branch government agencies that undertake a national security review of FCC-notified transactions involving potential foreign
ownership of U.S. telecommunications assets. These agencies include the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense, which we refer to collectively as “Team Telecom.” While we
believe that FCC approval will ultimately be obtained, this approval is not assured.

Table of Contents

CFIUS Approval

The Merger is also subject to review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which we refer to
as “CFIUS,” under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, including by the Foreign Investment and National Security
Act of 2007, which we refer to collectively as the “DPA,” which provides for national security reviews of foreign acquisitions of
U.S. companies that may have an impact on national security. CFIUS notification is voluntary, but provides a means to assure that
the President of the United States will not exercise his authority to block the transaction or require divestiture after closing.

State

In addition to U.S. federal regulatory and antitrust approvals, regulatory approvals are also being sought and filings have been
made in a number of states in the United States.

Timing of Regulatory Approvals

We currently anticipate that required regulatory approvals will be received by the third quarter of 2017, although the receipt of
these approvals and their timing cannot be assured or predicted at this time.

The Merger Agreement (page 86)

No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation (page 97)

Subject to certain exceptions, until the earlier to occur of the effective time of the Merger and the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Lumos Networks will generally not be permitted to solicit or discuss alternative proposals
with third parties (as described in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation”
beginning on page 97). Lumos Networks has agreed that it will not, directly or indirectly, among other things:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate, or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal or any

inquiry, offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made,
or could reasonably be expected to make any acquisition proposal; or

 

 
•  enter into any letter of intent or other agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal (except for an acceptable

confidentiality agreement that satisfies the requirements of the Merger Agreement) with any third party.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, if at any time prior to obtaining the affirmative vote to adopt the Merger Agreement of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, which we refer to as the “Company
stockholder approval,” (i) the Company receives a bona fide acquisition proposal that the Board reasonably believes, in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
superior proposal (as described in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation”
beginning on page 97) and (ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company
may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such third party and (B) furnish to such third party non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement that satisfies the
requirements of the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents

Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement (as described in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other
Offers; Change of Recommendation” beginning on page 97) and described below), the Board will not:
 

 
•  withdraw or withhold, or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Board’s recommendation that the Merger

Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Lumos Networks or publicly announce that it has proposed or resolved to
take such action;

 

 •  fail to include the Board’s recommendation in this proxy statement;
 

 

•  in the event any tender or exchange offer is commenced that would constitute an acquisition proposal, fail to publish,
send or provide to the Lumos Networks stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, and within ten
business days after such tender or exchange offer is first commenced, or subsequently amended in any material respect, a
statement recommending that the Lumos Networks stockholders reject such tender or exchange offer and publicly
affirming the Board’s recommendation; or

 

 
•  recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, or publicly propose or resolve to recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, any

acquisition proposal or any letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement.

We refer to each of the actions or events in the bullets above as an adverse recommendation change.

The Board is permitted to (i) make an adverse recommendation change in the event of an intervening event (as described in “The
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation” beginning on page 97) or in the case of a
superior proposal, and/or (ii) terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a superior
proposal if, in each case, the Board determines in good faith (after consultation its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that
the failure to take action with respect to such superior proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law subject further to Lumos Networks’ compliance with certain notice and other requirements as set forth
in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Board shall not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement for a superior proposal
unless Lumos Networks pays the company termination fee (as described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”
beginning on page 114) and, at the election of Parent, is available to engage in good faith negotiations with Parent during a
specified period.

For a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties and the Board’s ability to make
an adverse recommendation change, see “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation”
beginning on page 97.

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 111)

The parties expect to complete the Merger after the marketing period (as described in The Merger Agreement—Closing and
Effective Time of the Merger; Marketing Period” beginning on page 87) has ended and all of the conditions to the Merger in the
Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived. The parties currently expect to complete the Merger in the third quarter of 2017.
However, it is possible that factors outside of each party’s control could require them to complete the Merger at a later time or not
to complete it at all. The following are some of the conditions that must be satisfied or, where permitted by law, waived, before the
Merger may be consummated:

 This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the matters to be voted on thereat. The enclosed materials allow you to submit
a proxy to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock without attending the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
to ensure that your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are represented and voted at the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

Q: May I attend the annual meeting and vote in person?
 

A: Yes. All stockholders of record as of the record date may attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and vote in person.
Proof of stock ownership as of the record date and some form of government-issued photo identification (such as a valid driver’s
license or passport) will be required for admission to the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If you hold your shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock in a brokerage account or through another nominee, you are the beneficial owner of those shares but
not the record holder and you will need to obtain a “legal proxy” from the record holder to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

 

 Even if you plan to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and
return the enclosed proxy or to submit a proxy to vote electronically over the Internet or via telephone to ensure that your shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock will be represented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If you attend the 2017
Annual Meeting of Stockholders and wish to vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted.

 

 If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or
other nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Your broker, bank or other nominee
cannot vote on any of the proposals, except the auditor ratification proposal, without your instructions. If you hold your shares of
Lumos Networks Common Stock in “street name,” because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock in person at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless you request and obtain a valid
proxy in your name from your broker, bank or other nominee.

 
Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the annual meeting?
 

A: You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 (1) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
 

 
(2) a proposal to approve a non-binding advisory resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of our named executive

officers;
 

 
(3) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from time to time if necessary or

appropriate;
 

 (4) a proposal to elect nine directors to serve until the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;
 

 (5) a proposal to approve a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers; and
 

 
(6) a proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending

December 31, 2017.
 
Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Lumos Networks?
 

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Lumos Networks by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the merger proposal
is approved by the holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement
have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lumos Networks, with Lumos Networks continuing as the
surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, Lumos Networks will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Lumos
Networks will cooperate with Parent to de-list the Lumos Networks Common Stock from NASDAQ and de-register under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the effective time of the Merger, and at such time, we will no longer be a
publicly traded company and will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own
any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Lumos Networks Common Stock that you own, unless you have properly
exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if
you own 100 shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, you will receive $1,800.00 in cash in exchange for your shares, less any
applicable withholding taxes. In either case, as a result of the Merger, your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock will be
cancelled and you will not own shares in the surviving corporation.

 
Q: How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Lumos Networks Common Stock prior to the public

announcement of the Merger Agreement?
 

A: The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 18.2% over the year to date volume weighted average closing
price of Lumos Networks Common Stock ending as of February 17, 2017, the last trading day before the Merger Agreement was
announced, and a premium of approximately 34.9% over the volume-weighted price average of the 12 months ended February 17,
2017 of $13.35 and a 16.5% premium to $15.45, the average closing price of Lumos Networks Common Stock of the last 20
trading days before the Merger Agreement was announced.

 
Q: What do I need to do now? If I am going to attend the annual meeting, should I still submit a proxy?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the appendices to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, and the
documents we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Whether or not you expect to
attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as
possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone, so that your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock may be represented and can be voted at the 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. If you hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in “street name,” please refer to the voting
instruction forms provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, shortly after the Merger is completed, under the terms of the
Merger Agreement, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates or
surrender your book-entry shares to paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share
of Lumos Networks Common Stock represented by the stock certificates or book-entry shares. You should use the letter of
transmittal to exchange your stock certificates or book-entry shares for the cash payment to which you are entitled upon
completion of the Merger. If your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to effect the
surrender of your “street name” shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Please do
not send in your stock certificates now.

 
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock after the record date but

before the annual meeting? What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock
after the annual meeting but before the effective time of the Merger?

 

A: The record date for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is earlier than the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
and earlier than the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock after the record date but before the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, unless special arrangements (such as provision of
a proxy) are made between you and the person to

whom you transfer your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock and each of you notifies Lumos Networks in writing of such
special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders but will transfer
the right to receive the Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed to the person to whom you transfer your shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock.

 

 If you sell or transfer your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock after the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but before
the effective time, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed. In order to receive
the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock through the completion of the Merger.

Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock after the record date, we encourage
you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy or submit your proxy to vote via the Internet or by telephone.

 
Q: What is the position of the Board regarding the Merger?
 

A: All members of our Board voting on the Merger, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisors and after
review and consideration of various factors described in the section below entitled “The Merger—Recommendation of Our Board
of Directors and Reasons for the Merger—Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 46, (i) approved the execution, delivery
and performance by Lumos Networks of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Lumos Networks and its stockholders,
(iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Lumos Networks for adoption and (iv) declared that
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable.

 
Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Board recommends that you vote:
 

 (1) “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
 

 
(2) “FOR” the proposal to approve a non-binding advisory resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of our named

executive officers;
 

 
(3) “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from time to time if necessary

or appropriate;
 

 (4) “FOR” the proposal to elect nine directors to serve until the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;
 

 
(5) “FOR” the proposal to approve a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive

officers; and
 

 
(6) “FOR” the proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the

year ending December 31, 2017.
 
Q: How will our directors and executive officers vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A: We currently expect that our directors and current executive officers will vote all of their shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, although no director or executive officer has entered into any agreement
containing an obligation to do so. As of April 19, 2017, the record date for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our
directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,076,494 shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock outstanding on the record date (excluding any shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that would be
delivered upon exercise or conversion of stock options), representing approximately 4.5% of the outstanding shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock.

Table of Contents

Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Lumos Networks stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other
reason, Lumos Networks stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. Instead,
Lumos Networks will remain a public company, Lumos Networks Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

 

 Under specified circumstances, Lumos Networks may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be entitled to receive a
reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described under “The Merger Agreement
—Termination Fees” beginning on page 114.

 
Q: Do any of Lumos Networks’ directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Lumos

Networks stockholders generally?
 

A: In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that certain of our
directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a
stockholder generally. The members of the Board voting on the Merger were aware of these interests in evaluating and negotiating
the Merger Agreement, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement be
adopted by the stockholders of Lumos Networks. For a description of the interests of our directors and executive officers in the
Merger, see “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger” beginning on
page 64.

 
Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
the record date and entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal.

 

 The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone or to vote in person by ballot at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the merger proposal. Abstentions and broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
proposal.

 

 As of April 19, 2017, the record date for determining who is entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, there
were 23,944,060 shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock issued and outstanding. Each holder of Lumos Networks Common
Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Lumos Networks Common Stock owned by such holder as of the record date.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal?
 

A: Approval of the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present or represented and entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be approved. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the votes on this proposal.

Table of Contents

Q: What is “Merger-related compensation”?
 

A: “Merger-related compensation” is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the completion of the Merger and may be
payable to Lumos Networks’ named executive officers under our existing plans or agreements, which is the subject of the Merger-
related named executive officer compensation proposal. See “Proposal 2: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive
Officer Compensation” beginning on page 122.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve “Merger-related compensation” payable to Lumos

Networks’ named executive officers under its plans or agreements?
 

A: In accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Lumos Networks is required to
seek from its stockholders a non-binding, advisory vote on certain compensation that will or may become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the “Merger-related compensation” in the Merger-related named

executive officer compensation proposal at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders?
 

A: Approval of the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the
Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal is an advisory vote and will
not be binding on Lumos Networks or Parent. Further, the underlying compensation plans and agreements are contractual in
nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, payment of the “Merger-related compensation” is
not contingent on stockholder approval of the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal. Therefore, if the
Merger Agreement is adopted by Lumos Networks stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation will or may
become payable regardless of the outcome of the vote on the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
 

A: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented and entitled
to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against these
proposals and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal.

 
Q: What vote is required for the election of directors?
 

A: Under our bylaws, at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders a nominee for director will be elected to the Board if the votes
cast for such nominee’s election exceed the votes cast against such nominee’s election. Only votes actually cast will be counted
for the purpose of determining whether a particular nominee received the required vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will
have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors.

 
Q: What vote is required to adopt the auditor ratification proposal?
 

A: Approval of the auditor ratification proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented and
entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
against these proposals and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal.

 
Q: What vote is required to adopt the say on pay proposal?
 

A: Approval of the say on pay proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to
vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against these
proposals and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal.

Q: Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?
 

A: The cost of the solicitation of proxies on behalf of Lumos Networks will be borne by us. Lumos Networks has engaged the
services of Georgeson LLC to solicit proxies for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In connection with its retention by us,
Georgeson LLC has agreed to provide consulting, analytic and proxy solicitation services in connection with the 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. Lumos Networks has agreed to pay Georgeson LLC a fee of approximately $10,000, plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses for its services, and Lumos Networks will indemnify Georgeson LLC for certain losses arising out of its
proxy solicitation services. In addition, our directors, officers and other employees, or representatives of Georgeson LLC, may,
without additional compensation except reimbursement for actual expenses, solicit proxies by mail, in person or by
telecommunication. We will reimburse brokers, fiduciaries, custodians and other nominees for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
sending our proxy materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners.

 
Q: What is the quorum required?
 

A: According to our bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to be voted must be present or represented by proxy to
constitute a quorum. Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote on all matters. For purposes of the quorum, the stockholders
who are present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in person or by proxy and who abstain from voting are considered
stockholders who are present and entitled to vote and they count toward a quorum. Abstentions and shares of record held by a
broker or its nominee that are voted on any matter are included in determining whether a quorum is present. Broker shares that are
not voted on any matter, or “broker non-votes,” will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present.

 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock as a stockholder of record and as a

beneficial owner?
 

A: Most of our stockholders hold their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee rather
than directly in their own names. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock held of record and those owned beneficially.

 

 

•  Stockholder of Record. If your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our
transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent
directly to you by Lumos Networks. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote in person at the 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders or to grant your proxy to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock directly to the
individuals named on the enclosed proxy card.

 

 

•  Beneficial Owner. If your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you
are considered the “beneficial owner” of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held in “street name.” In that case,
this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to
those shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock by
following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However,
because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in person
at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee giving you the right to vote the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock at the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

Table of Contents

Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are registered in your name with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote or submit a proxy:

 

 
•  At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders – You can attend the 2017Annual Meeting of Stockholders and vote in person

by a ballot we will give you at the meeting.
 

 
•  By Telephone — Stockholders located in the United States can vote by telephone by following the instructions provided in

the proxy card or voting instruction;
 

 
•  By Internet — Stockholders located in the United States can vote by Internet by following the instructions provided in the

proxy card or voting instruction; or
 

 
•  By Mail — If you received your proxy materials by mail, you can vote by mail by signing, dating and mailing the enclosed

proxy card.

Internet and telephone facilities will be available 24 hours a day and close at 12:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on May 24, 2017.
 
 Even if you plan to attend the 2017Annual Meeting of Stockholders, you are strongly encouraged to complete and mail the

enclosed card for your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock or submit a proxy by telephone or the Internet. If you are a
record holder or if you obtain a valid proxy to vote shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock which you beneficially own, you
may still vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in person at the 2017Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Any such
vote will automatically revoke any proxy you previously submitted.

 

 If your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may
provide voting instructions through your broker, bank or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee, or electronically over the Internet or by telephone through your broker, bank or other
nominee if such a service is provided. To provide voting instructions via the Internet or via telephone through your broker, bank
or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your broker, bank or nominee.

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares of

Lumos Networks Common Stock for me?
 

A: Other than for the auditor ratification proposal, your broker, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares if
you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your broker, bank or
other nominee regarding the voting of your shares. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares,
your shares will not be voted, which will be treated as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

 

 If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee has discretion
to vote your shares only on the auditor ratification proposal. Your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the
merger proposal, the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal, the adjournment proposal, the election of
directors or the say on pay proposal without specific instructions from you. If you do not vote, your broker, bank or other nominee
may vote your shares only on the auditor ratification proposal in which case your shares will be counted toward the quorum for
the annual meeting, but will be voted only on the auditor ratification proposal.

 
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote by proxy?
 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the 2017
Annual Meeting of Stockholders by:

 

 •  Filing with our Secretary either a written revocation or an executed proxy bearing a later date;

Table of Contents

 •  Attending and voting in person at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; or
 

 •  Granting a subsequent proxy through the Internet or by telephone.

If you hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders if you obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is
called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock is
called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Timothy G. Biltz and Johan G. Broekhuysen, each of them with full power of
substitution, as proxies for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to submit your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the
proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock should be voted for or against or to abstain
from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Unless contrary instructions are specified, if the proxy card is executed and returned (and not revoked) prior to the 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock represented thereby will be voted “FOR” all of the
proposals set forth in this proxy statement. It is not currently anticipated that any other proposals for consideration will be
presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If other proposals requiring a vote of stockholders are brought before the
2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in a proper manner, the persons named in the enclosed proxy card, if properly authorized,
will have discretion to vote the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock they represent in accordance with their best judgment.

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards
or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in more than one brokerage
account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are registered
in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or grant a proxy to
vote via the Internet or telephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to ensure
that all of your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are voted. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid
return envelope; if you submit a proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that
proxy card.

 
Q: Who will count the votes?
 

A: The votes will be counted by the independent inspector of election appointed for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Table of Contents

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders?
 

A: Lumos Networks intends to announce preliminary voting results at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and publish final
results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All
reports that Lumos Networks files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 169.

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Lumos Networks Common Stock for cash pursuant to

the Merger?
 

A: If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on
page 81), the exchange of Lumos Networks Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will require you to
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash you
received pursuant to the Merger and your adjusted tax basis in the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock surrendered
pursuant to the Merger. A non-U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” beginning on page 81) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Lumos
Networks Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or (as
described in “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 81) Lumos Networks is, or
was during the relevant period, treated as a United States real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under
the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger is provided under “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning
on page 81.

 
Q: What will the holders of Lumos Networks options and restricted stock receive in the Merger?
 

A: Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each option to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock (whether or not
vested and exercisable) that is then outstanding will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest and be cancelled and entitle the option holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock subject to the option and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per share of Lumos Networks Common Stock underlying the option (less any
applicable withholding taxes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of seven business days prior to the closing of the
Merger (and conditional on the closing), each holder of an outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Lumos Networks
Common Stock will be entitled to exercise such option and shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock received upon such
exercise will be treated the same as other outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger. At or as soon as
practicable after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will make the option payments due to option holders,
if any, pursuant to the Company’s ordinary payroll practices.

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each share of Company restricted stock that is then outstanding will
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and the restrictions thereon will lapse and entitle the
holder of such share of Company restricted stock to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes and
in accordance with the same terms and conditions applied to holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock generally. At or as soon
as practicable after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will make the restricted stock payments, if any, due
to each holder of such Company restricted stock pursuant to the Company’s ordinary payroll practices. See “The Merger
Agreement—Merger Consideration—Outstanding Equity Awards and Other Awards” beginning on page 88.

 
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 

A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to consummate the Merger in the third
quarter of 2017 (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Closing and Effective Time of the Merger;
Marketing Period” beginning on page 87). However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because
the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders and the
receipt of regulatory approvals.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 

A: Yes. As a holder of Lumos Networks Common Stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions, including that you do not vote (in person or by proxy) in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 76. For the full text of
Section 262 of the DGCL, please see Appendix B attached hereto.

Failure to strictly comply with all procedures required by Section 262 of the DGCL will result in a loss of your right to appraisal.
We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety and, in view of their complexity, to promptly consult
with your legal and financial advisors if you wish to pursue your appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
 

A: Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, proxy statement
and notice of Annual Meeting to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are
members of the same family. Each stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process,
known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce our
expenses.

If you would like to receive your own set of our annual disclosure documents this year or in future years, follow the instructions
described below. Similarly, if you share an address with another stockholder and together both of you would like to receive only a
single set of our annual disclosure documents, follow these instructions.

If your shares are registered in your own name, please contact us at our executive offices at One Lumos Plaza, P.O. Box 1068,
Waynesboro, Virginia 22980, Attention: Vice President – Investor Relations, to inform us of your request. If a bank, broker or
other nominee holds your shares, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee directly.

 
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
 

A: If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or this proxy statement, would like
additional copies of this proxy statement or need help submitting your proxy or voting your shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock, please contact Georgeson LLC, our proxy solicitor, toll-free at (800) 905-7281 or by email at
LumosNetworks@georgeson.com.

If your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, you may call your broker, bank or
other nominee for additional information.

THE ANNUAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place

The 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held at 9:00 a.m. (local time) on May 24, 2017, at the offices of Troutman Sanders
LLP, 1001 Haxall Point, 15th Floor, Richmond, Virginia, unless it is postponed or adjourned.

Purpose of the Annual Meeting

At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the record date to consider and vote on the
following proposals:
 

 (1) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
 

 
(2) a proposal to approve a non-binding advisory resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of our named executive

officers;
 

 
(3) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from time to time if necessary or

appropriate;
 

 (4) a proposal to elect nine directors to serve until the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;
 

 (5) a proposal to approve a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers; and
 

 
(6) a proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending

December 31, 2017.

Stockholders may also be asked to transact such other business as may properly be brought before the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders or any postponements or adjournments of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement in order for the Merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to
approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will not occur. The vote on the Merger-related named executive
officer compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder
may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal,
and vice versa. Because the vote on the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal is only advisory in nature, it
will not be binding on Lumos Networks, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because Lumos Networks is contractually
obligated to pay such Merger-related compensation, the compensation will or may become payable, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, if the merger proposal is approved, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Recommendations of the Board

All members of our Board voting on the Merger, after consulting with Lumos Networks’ outside legal counsel, and Financial Advisors,
and after review and consideration of various factors described in the section entitled “The Merger—Recommendation of Our Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger—Reasons for the Merger” (beginning on page 47, (i) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by Lumos Networks of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Lumos Networks and its stockholders, (iii) directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Lumos Networks for adoption and (iv) declared that the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable.

Meeting of Stockholders, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a legal proxy or broker’s proxy card and bring it to the
2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in order to vote.

With respect to shares held in the Lumos Networks Savings and Security Plan, your proxy card, when signed and returned, or your
telephone or Internet vote, will also constitute voting instructions to John Hancock, who we refer to as the “Trustee,” for these shares.
Shares for which voting instructions are not received, subject to the Trustee’s fiduciary obligations, will be voted by the Trustee in the
same proportion as the shares for which voting instructions are received from other participants in the plan. To allow sufficient time for
voting by the Trustee, your voting instructions must be received by 12:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on May 19, 2017.

Only stockholders who own Lumos Networks Common Stock as of the close of business on April 19, 2017 will be entitled to attend
the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Proof of stock ownership as of this date and some form of government-issued photo
identification (such as a valid driver’s license or passport) will be required for admission to the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
If you hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in a brokerage account or through another nominee, you are the beneficial
owner of those shares but not the record holder and you will need to obtain a “legal proxy” from the record holder to attend the 2017
Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

According to our bylaws, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to be voted must be present or represented by proxy to
constitute a quorum. Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote on all matters. For purposes of the quorum and the discussion below
regarding the vote necessary to take stockholder action, the stockholders who are present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
in person or by proxy and who abstain from voting are considered stockholders who are present and entitled to vote and they count
toward a quorum. Abstentions and shares of record held by a broker or its nominee that are voted on any matter are included in
determining whether a quorum is present. Broker shares that are not voted on any matter, or “broker non-votes,” will not be included in
determining whether a quorum is present.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Under rules of self-regulatory organizations governing brokers, your bank, broker or other nominee may vote your shares in its
discretion on “routine” matters. These rules also provide, however, that when a proposal is not a “routine” matter and your bank, broker
or other nominee has not received your voting instructions with respect to such proposal, your bank, broker or other nominee cannot
vote your shares on that proposal. When a bank, broker or other nominee does not cast a vote for a routine or a non-routine matter, it is
called a “broker non-vote.” Your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to (i) the Merger Agreement;
(ii) the non-binding advisory resolution to approve the Merger-related compensation of named executive officers; (iii) the adjournment
of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from time to time if necessary or appropriate; (iv) the election of the nominees for
director or (v) the non-binding advisory resolution to approve the compensation for our named executive officers, in the absence of
your specific instructions as to how to vote with respect to such proposals, because under the rules these proposals are not considered
“routine” matters. The ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP is considered a routine matter.

The approval of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote against this proposal. The approval of the non-binding advisory resolution to approve the Merger-related compensation
of named executive officers and the approval of the adjournment of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders from time to time if
necessary or appropriate each require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote at the
2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the votes on these proposals.

Under our bylaws, at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders a nominee for director will be elected to the Board if the votes cast for
such nominee’s election exceed the votes cast against such nominee’s election. Only votes actually cast will be counted for the purpose
of determining whether a particular nominee received the required vote. A stockholder may withhold votes from any or all nominees
by notation on the proxy card. Except to the extent that a stockholder withholds votes from any or all nominees, the persons identified
as proxies and attorneys-in-fact, in their sole discretion, will vote such proxy for the election of the nominees listed below as directors.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors.

If a nominee does not receive the required vote, he or she shall offer to resign. The Board will consider whether to accept the
resignation in accordance with the procedures set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

Pursuant to the terms of the Investors Rights Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2015, which we refer to as the “Investors Rights
Agreement,” which was entered into in connection with the associated Note Agreement and Warrant Agreement, among us and
Pamplona, Pamplona currently has the right to designate two directors. In accordance with the Investors Rights Agreement (as such
terms are defined in the Investors Rights Agreement), if Pamplona’s ownership of the 8% Notes falls below 65% of the aggregate
principal amount of the 8% Notes, Pamplona is entitled to designate one director to the Board; and if Pamplona’s ownership of the 8%
Notes falls below 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8% Notes, Pamplona is no longer entitled to designate a director to the
Board. The Investors Rights Agreement will remain in effect so long as the Warrants and the Lumos Networks Common Stock
underlying the Warrants remain outstanding. These rights are not transferrable other than to commonly controlled affiliates.

With respect to the other matters to be voted upon at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approving the non-binding advisory
resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers and ratifying the appointment of KPMG LLP, each requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to
be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against these proposals and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome
of the vote on these proposals.

With respect to any other matters that may come before the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including consideration of a motion
to adjourn the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to another time or place, if proxies are returned, such proxies will be voted in a
manner deemed by the proxy representatives named therein to be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.

Table of Contents

MTN Infrastructure BidCo, Inc., which we refer to as “Merger Sub,” is a Delaware corporation that was formed solely for the purpose
of entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the related
financing transactions. Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and has not engaged in any business except for activities
incidental to its formation and as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the related financing transactions. Upon the completion
of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and Lumos Networks will continue as the surviving corporation.

Certain Effects of the Merger on Lumos Networks

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lumos Networks, with
Lumos Networks continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, Lumos Networks will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. Lumos Networks will cooperate with Parent to de-list Lumos Networks Common Stock from the NASDAQ and
de-register under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the Merger, and at such time, we
will no longer be a publicly traded company and will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, the directors of Merger
Sub will continue as the directors of the surviving corporation. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the
capital stock of the surviving corporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in “—Merger
Consideration” beginning on page 34.

The effective time of the Merger will occur upon the filing of certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(or at such later time as we and Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).

Effect on Lumos Networks if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Lumos Networks stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
Lumos Networks stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. Instead, Lumos
Networks will remain a public company, Lumos Networks Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ and
registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be consummated, it
is possible that the price of Lumos Networks Common Stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if
ever, the price of Lumos Networks Common Stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. If the Merger is not consummated, the Board will continue to evaluate and
review Lumos Networks’ business operations, properties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes
as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Lumos
Networks’ stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction
acceptable to Lumos Networks will be offered or that Lumos Networks’ business, prospects or results of operation will not be
adversely impacted.

In addition, under specified circumstances, Lumos Networks may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be entitled to
receive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described under “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on page 114.

Merger Consideration

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Lumos Networks Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) shares held by Lumos Networks as treasury stock, held by any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Lumos Networks or of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub; and
(ii) shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the Merger and who have properly
demanded appraisal rights for such shares and have properly exercised and not withdrawn appraisal rights under Delaware law with
respect to such shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable

withholding taxes, and without any action by the holders of such shares, will cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist,
and each certificate formerly representing such shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock will thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

Lumos Investment Holdings, Ltd., an affiliate of Pamplona, the holder of the Warrant, has agreed, subject to the effectiveness of the
Merger, to exercise the Warrant. Upon exercise, Pamplona will receive 1,225,278 shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that will
be exchanged for the Merger Consideration.

After the Merger is completed, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
but you will no longer have any rights as a Lumos Networks stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that stockholders who have
not voted in favor of the Merger and who have properly demanded their appraisal rights and have properly exercised and not
withdrawn appraisal rights under Delaware law, will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by
Delaware law, as described below under “—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 76).

Background of the Merger

Since we became a public company following our spin-off from NTELOS in November 2011, our Board and management have
periodically reviewed and assessed our operations and financial performance, business strategy, the various trends and conditions
affecting our industry, our businesses generally and a variety of strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including
business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, members of our senior
management team and Board members have met with senior management from other companies within our industry to discuss industry
developments and potential strategic alternatives.

In May 2014, we engaged Wells Fargo Securities as our financial advisor to assist us in a strategic alternatives review. With Wells
Fargo Securities’ assistance we engaged in a broad sellside process in late 2014 in which 31 strategic parties and 49 financial sponsors
were contacted. During this process, first round bids were received and management presentations and other due diligence occurred.
We then received two second round bids. One of these bids was a cash offer of $18.00 per share. This bid was withdrawn following
subsequent due diligence. The other bid involved a stock merger with a privately held company with an implied per share value for
Company stockholders of substantially less than $18.00 per share. One concern that was expressed within the universe of potential
buyers during this process was the Company’s mix of assets among legacy local exchange carrier and competitive local exchange
carrier assets, on the one hand, and fiber assets, on the other hand, which limited both the number of parties interested in participating
in the process and the level of the preliminary offer prices that were made. However, in August 2015 we received a strategic investment
from one of the financial sponsors contacted in the process, Pamplona Capital Management, as the Company pursued capital raising
alternatives.

Following August 2015, our Board continued to regularly review and evaluate our strategic plan and objectives. In connection with
these reviews, management and the Board discussed a number of concerns with the longer-term risk profile of the Company, including
the competitive environment for our FTTC and enterprise businesses, resulting in increasing pricing pressure; continued erosion of the
legacy revenue base, making consolidated top-line growth challenging; less visibility on timing and sizing of large FTTC RFPs than in
past years; scale issues in a rapidly consolidating fiber/bandwidth sector; and the fact that Lumos Networks’ market capitalization
remained below $500 million, with accompanying issues such as trading liquidity and research attention. The Board also remained
aware of the concern within the 2014 potential buyer universe with the Company’s asset mix.

As part of this review of strategic alternatives, on March 4, 2016, at a regular quarterly meeting in New York City, the Board received a
presentation from representatives of UBS about a possible divestiture of our regulated, lower growth segments (Residential and Small
Business and RLEC Access, which we refer to as our “LEC business”) and authorized management to engage UBS as our financial
advisor in connection with such a transaction. Thereafter, during our 2015 earnings call in March 2016, we announced we were
beginning the process to plan for the separation of the LEC business to transform into a pure-play fiber company. Following the
announcement of this separation strategy, we received several inbound inquiries from both strategic and financial buyers regarding a
potential sale or merger of the entire Company.

In mid-March 2016, a representative of a potential strategic acquirer, which we refer to as “Party A,” contacted Mr. Biltz, our Chief
Executive Officer, to discuss a possible acquisition of the Company by Party A.

In mid-April 2016, an industry contact of Mr. Biltz informed Mr. Biltz that EQT was interested in speaking with him about a potential
transaction with the Company. Mr. Biltz had a call with representatives of EQT on April 21, 2016.

Also in mid-April 2016, Mr. Guth, our Chairman of the Board, was contacted by a representative of a potential strategic merger partner,
which we refer to as “Party B,” and discussed Party B’s interest in a potential transaction with Lumos Networks.

In late April 2016, Mr. Biltz spoke with Mr. Guth regarding his earlier discussion with EQT. Mr. Guth then reached out to an EQT
representative to schedule a call. On May 2, 2016, Mr. Guth and the EQT representative discussed EQT’s interest in pursuing a
potential acquisition of Lumos Networks.

On May 4, 2016, our Board met at a regularly scheduled meeting in New York City, together with representatives of management, UBS
and our outside counsel, Troutman Sanders. Mr. Guth informed the Board of the contacts with Party A, Party B and EQT and,
following a discussion of our strategic alternatives and the background of the potential acquirers, the Board authorized Mr. Guth to
contact EQT and Party B (due to Mr. Guth’s prior conversations with these parties), and Mr. Biltz to contact Party A (due to Mr. Biltz’s
prior conversation with this party), to continue the discussions regarding a potential transaction. At this same meeting, representatives
of UBS presented the Board with updated information about a possible LEC divestiture transaction. The Board appointed a Transaction
Review Committee to review next steps with regard to a possible LEC divestiture transaction.

Shortly following the May 4, 2016 Board meeting, Mr. Guth and Mr. Biltz reached out to EQT and Party B and Party A, respectively,
about a potential transaction with Lumos Networks. Following those contacts, Party B stated that its board of directors would consider
a possibility of a combination with Lumos Networks, but Party A stated that it was currently pursuing other opportunities.

On May 7, 2016, EQT initiated its due diligence process with Lumos Networks and sent over a preliminary due diligence request list.
Management provided an initial response to this request during the week of May 9, 2016, but the information provided was limited
because the companies had not entered into a non-disclosure agreement.

On May 17, 2016, Mr. Guth and another member of our Board, Mr. Pruellage, had a lunch meeting with representatives of EQT in New
York City discussing a potential acquisition, and management had a follow-up call with EQT representatives later that week. Following
these meetings, an EQT representative contacted Mr. Guth regarding next steps and indicated that EQT would be in a position to
submit an acquisition proposal later in the month.

In late May 2016, the CEO of Party B contacted Mr. Guth and submitted an oral proposal for an all-stock strategic merger transaction
in which Lumos Networks stockholders would receive an unspecified premium.

On May 29, 2016, EQT delivered a letter of intent for the acquisition of Lumos Networks for $17.50 per share in cash. Our Board met
that same day by conference call and reviewed the terms of the EQT letter of intent and the expectations regarding the proposal from
Party B. The Board discussed the adequacy of the price per share in the EQT letter and discussed tactics for responding. The Board
determined to inform EQT that it would need to increase the proposed acquisition price for the Board to seriously consider the offer.

On May 30, 2016, Mr. Guth received a term sheet from Party B for an all stock strategic merger transaction, with a per share value of
approximately $14.50 to $16.00 per share.

Table of Contents

On May 31, 2016, representatives of UBS made a presentation to the Transaction Review Committee regarding a potential divestiture
of the LEC business to a strategic party, which we refer to as “Party C.”

On June 3, 2016, Mr. Guth and Mr. Pruellage spoke with representatives of EQT and expressed the Board’s disappointment with the
$17.50 per share price. The following week, a representative of EQT contacted Mr. Guth and indicated that EQT would be submitting a
revised letter of intent. In describing the increased offer that EQT was preparing, the EQT representative informed Mr. Guth that the
new offer would represent a “stretched” price. On June 8, 2016, EQT delivered a revised letter of intent, with an increased price of
$18.00 per share and requesting exclusivity to allow EQT to commit to the time and expense of conducting confirmatory due diligence.

Also in mid-June, a representative of a potential strategic party, which we refer to as “Party D,” contacted Mr. Biltz about a possible
acquisition of Lumos Networks, and proposing a valuation of $15.00 to $16.00 per share. Around the same time, a representative of a
potential financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Party E,” contacted Mr. Biltz about a combination of one of its portfolio companies
and Lumos Networks.

On June 14, 2016, our Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management and Troutman Sanders, to consider
the strategic alternatives then under consideration. The Board noted that the Company’s stock was currently trading in the $12.00—
$13.00 range and expressed its view that the $18.00 offer from EQT could be in the best interests of stockholders but also that it would
be important for EQT to confirm this offer following due diligence and for the Board to engage the assistance of experts in evaluating
this offer and considering other steps to take. In light of these considerations as well as the business combination activity in the
industry in general, the Board determined that the Company should evaluate a possible business combination transaction in addition to
evaluating the LEC separation strategy and authorized Mr. Biltz to start the process of selecting a financial advisor to assist with this
process. Remembering the 2014 sale process, the Board took into account both EQT’s $18.00 offer price and EQT’s expressed interest
in both the LEC business and the fiber business in determining to proceed with the engagement of financial advisors. The Board
considered the respective qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of our business and industry of Wells Fargo Securities
and UBS, as well as the benefits of engaging Wells Fargo Securities due to its experience with the Company in the 2014 strategic
alternatives process and the benefits of engaging UBS due to its experience with the Company in the LEC business strategic
alternatives review. In addition to considering the individual qualifications of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS, the Board also
considered the benefits of having joint financial advisors. These benefits included obtaining diverse perspectives and additional
resources to assist the Board in its review of strategic alternatives and to assist management if a potential transaction were to be
pursued.

Following the meeting, and at the direction of our Board, Mr. Guth informed EQT that we would sign a confidentiality agreement to
facilitate the due diligence process, but that we would not grant them exclusivity at that time. Mr. Biltz contacted a representative of
Party D and notified him that the suggested purchase price of $15.00—$16.00 per share would need to be increased before the Board
would seriously consider the proposal. Mr. Guth contacted the representative of Party B and notified him that the suggested valuation
of $14.50—$16.00 per share would need to be increased before the Board would seriously consider the proposal.

Also following the meeting, Mr. Biltz reached out to representatives of UBS and Wells Fargo Securities regarding their respective
potential engagements as our financial advisors and discussed with each of them the engagement terms and parameters authorized by
our Board.

On June 17, 2016, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with EQT. In light of the premium $18.00 represented to current stock
trading prices and the short duration of the restriction, we agreed to be restricted from soliciting additional proposals until July 8, 2016,
while remaining able to discuss existing proposals and to receive unsolicited proposals.

Also on June 17, 2016, Party D submitted an indication of interest to acquire Lumos Networks for $15.00 per share in an all stock deal.

On June 21, 2016, Mr. Biltz met with representatives of EQT during an industry conference.

On June 22, 2016, Mr. Biltz and a representative of the Board met with a representative of Party E. Around that same time, Mr. Guth
informed a representative of Party B that the Board would be moving in a different direction if the valuation was not increased. The
Company and Party B had no further discussions about a transaction after that time.

On June 24, 2016, EQT informed Mr. Guth that it could not pursue a transaction at the time because its existing infrastructure fund had
entered into another acquisition agreement that would utilize substantially all of its remaining financing capacity, but that EQT
remained interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company once it had raised another infrastructure investment fund.
Subsequently, we and EQT agreed to terminate the non-solicitation provisions in the confidentiality agreement.

On June 27, 2016, our Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management and Troutman Sanders, to discuss
the various outstanding strategic alternatives, including that EQT had indicated an interest in resuming discussions at a later date, and
approved the engagement of UBS and Wells Fargo Securities as its financial advisors. At that time the Board reviewed disclosures
provided by UBS and Wells Fargo Securities about prior investment banking relationships with certain possible counterparties
including, to the extent applicable, any current or recent EQT relationships. The Board considered the disclosures made and determined
that each of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS was qualified to serve as its financial advisor. We entered into an engagement letter with
Wells Fargo Securities on June 29, 2016 and with UBS on June 30, 2016.

On July 7, 2016, members of management, together with the representatives from UBS, met with Party C and presented information
regarding a transaction involving the sale of the LEC business.

On July 12, 2016, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party D. Members of our management team and representatives of
Party D met in New York City to discuss a possible transaction.

The confidentiality agreement with Party D contained a customary “standstill” provision restricting each of Party D and the Company
from making offers to acquire the other without the prior approval of the other’s board of directors. Nearly all of the additional
confidentiality agreements entered into by the Company that are referred to in this “Background of the Merger” contained similar
standstill provisions. These confidentiality agreements also contained provisions prohibiting the parties from asking the Company to
waive the standstill provisions (“don’t ask to waive” provisions). As discussed below in “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page
86, the Merger Agreement specifically allows the Company to waive these “don’t ask to waive” provisions to the extent the Board
determines that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

On July 29, 2016, our Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management and Troutman Sanders, to review
events that had occurred since the last Board meeting. On August 2, 2016, our Board met, together with representatives of
management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, in New York City at a regularly scheduled meeting and reviewed the
status of various strategic alternatives. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS provided updates on the discussions with
EQT, Party C, Party D and Party E. The Board considered next steps and instructed Wells Fargo Securities and UBS to contact (a) EQT
to discuss possible next steps; (b) Party D to inform Party D that if it were to increase its offer the Board would consider approving the
exchange of due diligence information; and (c) Party E to discuss whether it desired to schedule a meeting to discuss a possible
transaction. The Board also considered information regarding a possible acquisition by Lumos Networks of Clarity.

During the following week, as directed by the Board, representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS communicated with EQT’s
financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, which we refer to as “Morgan Stanley,” and with Party D and Party E.

On August 4, 2016, members of management met with representatives of another potential financial sponsor, which we refer to as
“Party F.”

During the following week, Mr. Biltz attended an industry conference where he had conversations with representatives of EQT, Party A
and Party E.

In mid-August, 2016, we provided a draft of a confidentiality agreement to Party E, but Party E never responded to the draft.

On August 26, 2016, the Transaction Review Committee discussed possible next steps regarding a sale of the LEC business to Party C
and on August 31, 2016 we received a response from Party C on our LEC divestiture transaction proposal.

On August 29, 2016, Mr. Biltz met with management of another potential strategic acquirer, which we refer to as “Party G.”

On September 8, 2016, the Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS
and Troutman Sanders. Management and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS provided updates on meetings with parties
that had occurred since the August 2, 2016 Board meeting. After discussion, the Board authorized management to continue discussions
with Party C regarding a sale of the LEC business and requested that UBS provide the Board with more information regarding a
transaction with Party C at a future meeting. The Board also directed Wells Fargo Securities and UBS to inform EQT that we were
interested in resuming discussions with EQT once EQT was closer to raising its new infrastructure fund.

On September 19, 2016, Party C informed representatives of UBS that its board of directors was having reservations about a
transaction for the LEC business, but that they would reconsider it at their October meeting. Following Party C’s October Board
meeting, representatives of Party C informed representatives of UBS that Party C had determined not to proceed with a transaction.

On September 20, 2016, the Board met by conference call to discuss the latest updates from management with respect to an acquisition
of Clarity. Management noted that while Clarity would be a small acquisition, it would both contribute Adjusted EBITDA immediately
following closing and provide the Company with a new North Carolina enterprise market.

On October 4, 2016, Party A submitted a preliminary proposal to acquire Lumos Networks for $14.77 per share payable in a mix of
cash and common stock.

The Board met the following day by conference call, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and
Troutman Sanders, to discuss the proposal from Party A and to receive updates on the LEC divestiture discussions with Party C as well
as on other strategic discussions. The Board asked the representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS to contact EQT about the
status of its new fund raise and to contact Party A to express its disappointment with the offer.

Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS communicated with representatives of Party A on October 7, 2016, as directed by
the Board.

Our financial advisors also contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley regarding the status of EQT’s new fund raise. On October 12,
2016, Mr. Guth and representatives of EQT discussed EQT’s interest in renewing discussions with us and performing due diligence in
order to confirm an $18.00 price. On October 13, 2017, EQT provided us with a due diligence request list and proposed timetable.

In October 2016, Party D notified the Company that it had determined not to proceed with a transaction.

On October 17, 2016, Party G submitted an indication of interest for a merger with us for $16.24 per share payable in common stock,
with the potential for a portion of the consideration to be paid in cash. Thereafter, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with
Party G.

On October 27, 2016, the Board held a regular quarterly meeting in New York City, at which representatives of management, Wells
Fargo Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders were present. Among other items, the Board received an update from members of
management on discussions management was having about a possible acquisition opportunity, DC74. Management noted that while,
like Clarity, DC74 would be a small acquisition, it would both increase Lumos Network’s data center business and the North Carolina
addressable market share. The Board reviewed preliminary breakage cost estimates relating to a possible separation of the LEC
business. UBS representatives reviewed alternatives for a LEC divestiture transaction now that Party C had determined not to proceed.
Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS reviewed their preliminary financial analysis of the Company. A representative of
Troutman Sanders reviewed the Board’s duties under Delaware law. In light of the possible interest in a business combination
transaction expressed by parties with whom we had discussions to date, the Board determined to consider other parties who might be
contacted, in addition to parties that have previously contacted the Company, with respect to a potential transaction for the entire
Company, while continuing to monitor alternatives for a LEC only transaction. The Directors who had been members of the Board
during the 2014 sale process referred to the parties which had shown the most interest in the Company during the process. The Board
discussed potential other parties who could be contacted. The Board discussed the preliminary operating model that had been presented
by management (see “—Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 58). The Board directed management to prepare an
investment case model that could be reviewed by the Board. The Board determined to appoint a Strategic Planning Preparation
Committee, which we refer to as the “Strategic Committee,” consisting of Messrs. Guth, Pruellage and Robinson to assist the Board in
preparing

for possible strategic discussions with other parties. The Board also authorized the Strategic Committee to consider the parties who
might be contacted with respect to a strategic transaction and, in connection therewith to consult with representatives of Wells Fargo
Securities and UBS, and thereafter to present recommendations to the full Board.

On November 3, 2016, and as directed by the Board, management and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS met with
representatives of EQT and Morgan Stanley to discuss possible next steps.

The Strategic Committee met by conference call on November 7 together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities,
UBS and Troutman Sanders. The Strategic Committee received a review of Director duties from a representative of Troutman Sanders
and considered various strategic alternatives as well as possible next steps, including conducting a “market check” and preparing an
“investment case” model that could be shared with potential acquirers.

On November 9, 2016, in our third quarter earnings release we announced that UBS was assisting us in exploring strategic alternatives
for our LEC business. Following this disclosure, UBS received a number of in-bound calls from various parties in response to the
Company’s announcement.

The Strategic Committee met by conference call on November 13, 2016, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo
Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders. The Strategic Committee reviewed management’s “investment case” model. In addition to
updates on conversations with EQT and Party A provided by representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS, representatives of
UBS notified the Strategic Committee of an in-bound call they received from another potential financial sponsor, which we refer to as
“Party H,” and in-bound calls received in response to the announcement of the Company’s exploration of strategic alternatives for the
LEC business. The Strategic Committee authorized management to provide the “investment case” model (see “—Certain Financial
Projections” beginning on page 58) to the rest of the Board for comment and then to the third-party bidders.

On November 11, 2016, a representative of EQT contacted Mr. Guth to discuss next steps.

In mid-November, management held diligence meetings with representatives of Party G.

On November 30, 2016, the Board met, together with representatives of management and Troutman Sanders, by conference call in
order to review information relating to the Company’s possible acquisition of DC74. During this call, Mr. Biltz provided an update on
the discussions with EQT, Party A and Party G. The same day, Party A submitted a revised preliminary proposal to acquire Lumos
Networks for a purchase price of $17.00 per share, payable in a mix of cash and stock.

On December 1, 2016, management met with representatives of EQT for diligence meetings.

On December 2 and 4, 2016, the Strategic Committee met by conference call, together with representatives of management, Wells
Fargo Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, and considered options for performing a “market check.” A representative of Troutman
Sanders reviewed director fiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee and the Wells Fargo Securities and UBS representatives discussed
possible risks in running a full auction process as was done in 2014, including the risk of rumors and resulting publicity (as occurred in
2014); the fact that the Company has had other preliminary discussions both in 2014 and in 2016 with parties about a potential business
combination, none of which included potential purchase prices as high as that under discussion with EQT other than one that was
withdrawn in 2014 following due diligence; and the possible delay that could occur in being able to respond to current potentially
attractive inbound inquiries with the result that these parties might move on to other alternatives. Representatives of Wells Fargo
Securities and UBS also reviewed the process that was run in 2014, the extensive industry consolidation that has occurred since 2014
and the parties who might be interested in and able to execute a transaction with the Company. The Strategic Committee discussed
alternatives for extending the engagements of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS in light of the fact that these engagements were then
scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. The Strategic Committee approved a list of possible parties to contact, in addition to the
parties with whom we had already engaged in discussions, to provide to the Board. In identifying such parties, the Strategic Committee
focused on those parties with anticipated interest in an acquisition of the Company (including parties who had participated in the
process in 2014), including a demonstrated track record of paying a competitive price, and a perceived ability to offer acceptable value
and to finance such an acquisition.

On December 5, 2016, the Board met by conference call together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS
and Troutman Sanders. The Board received a review of fiduciary duties from Troutman Sanders. The Board and the Wells Fargo
Securities and UBS representatives discussed the risks in running a full auction process as was done in 2014, including risk of rumors
and the fact that the Company has had other preliminary discussions both in 2014 and 2016 with parties about a potential business
combination, only one of which included a potential purchase price as high as was currently under discussion with EQT but was
withdrawn following due diligence; and the possible delay that could occur in being able to respond to current attractive in-bound
inquiries with the result that these parties might move on to other alternatives. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS
reviewed the process that was run in 2014, the industry consolidation that has occurred since 2014, and the parties who might be
interested in and able to execute a transaction with the Company and not have to undergo the risks of running a full auction process in
order to be able to maximize shareholder value. The Board reviewed the proposed list of parties to contact prepared by the Strategic
Committee and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS. The Board approved the list and directed our financial advisors to
contact 10 parties in addition to the seven parties with whom the Company had already had discussions in 2016. Following this
meeting representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS contacted these parties.

In early December 2016, a representative of EQT had calls with Mr. Guth and Mr. Biltz to discuss next steps.

In early December 2016, a representative of another potential financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Party I,” contacted Mr. Biltz
about its possible interest in acquiring Lumos Networks.

In early-mid December 2016, we entered into confidentiality agreements with Party A and four new potential strategic acquirers, which
we refer to as “Party J,” “Party K,” “Party L” and “Party M,” respectively, and a new potential financial sponsor, which we refer to as
“Party N,” all of whom entered the process as a result of the market check contacts from our financial advisors. Shortly, thereafter,
Party J determined not to participate in further discussions. Later in December, Party K, Party M and Party N each notified us that they
were no longer interested in participating in discussions.

The Strategic Committee met by conference call on December 12, 2016, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo
Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, to review the status of discussions with EQT, Party A and Party G and to hear from the
financial advisors about the responses from their outbound inquiries. Following this discussion, the Strategic Committee authorized
Wells Fargo Securities and UBS to contact another potential financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Party O,” who was not initially
included on the market check list. Party O later informed our financial advisors that it was declining to participate in discussions.

On December 14, 2016, management and our financial advisors met with Party A and its advisors for due diligence meetings. On
December 15, 2016, management met with a potential purchaser of the LEC. On that day, we also entered into a confidentiality
agreement with Party I.

On December 16, 2016, representatives of management had conference calls with representatives of EQT to discuss diligence topics.

The Strategic Committee met by conference call on December 16, 2016, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo
Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, to review the status of discussions with the various parties. The Strategic Committee directed
the financial advisors to inform Party A and Party G that they would have to increase their offers if they desired to be competitive. The
Strategic Committee also determined to permit Party H to submit a joint bid with another potential financial sponsor. In connection
with Party H’s joint bid, the Strategic Committee determined to recommend to the Board that Mr. Askowitz be recused from further
Board deliberations of the process due to Mr. Askowitz’s serving as an employee of an investment banking firm that would be
providing services to Party H. Following the meeting, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party H. The Strategic
Committee also discussed amending the engagement letters with our financial advisors to extend the terms of the letters.

Throughout December 2016, the discussions continued with potential acquirers, including EQT. Wells Fargo Securities and UBS again
informed Party A that it should use the due diligence process to find additional value for its proposal if it wanted to be competitive.
Mr. Biltz also had calls with a representative of Party F.

The Strategic Committee and the Board each met by conference call on December 21, 2016, together with representatives of
management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, to review the status of the discussions with various parties and to
discuss amending the terms of the engagement letters with Wells Fargo Securities and UBS. The Board determined that Mr. Askowitz
should be recused from further Board deliberations of the process due to his serving as an employee of an investment banking firm that
would be providing services to Party H. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS presented an update to the Board on the
status of the discussions with the various parties and summaries of the contacted parties. The Board reviewed contextual information
from management about the Company’s recent solid operating performance but also the Company’s longer-term risk profile, which it
determined had not changed in any material way from earlier in the year. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS provided
information about current conditions in the institutional term loan and high yield markets for mergers and acquisitions financing. A
representative of Troutman Sanders reviewed Director fiduciary duties. The Board reviewed disclosures provided by representatives of
Wells Fargo Securities and UBS, respectively, about their respective investment banking relationships with counterparties including, to
the extent applicable, any current or recent EQT relationships. The Board considered the disclosures made and determined that each of
Wells Fargo Securities and UBS was qualified to continue to serve as its financial advisor. Management reviewed with the Board a five
year operating model that had been updated as a result of discussions with the Board and the Strategic Committee in late October and
November (see “—Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 58). The Board approved extending the terms of the Wells Fargo
Securities and UBS engagement letters.

On December 22, 2016, EQT delivered a letter of intent confirming its interest in acquiring the Company for $18.00 per share in cash
and including a “highly confident” letter from a potential source of debt financing and requesting exclusivity. EQT stated in the letter
of intent that EQT had substantially completed its commercial due diligence and requested exclusivity to allow EQT to commit to the
time and expense of conducting remaining confirmatory due diligence. On that same date, at the direction of the Board, representatives
of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS contacted Party A to give it additional valuation expectations if it desired to be competitive.

On December 27, 2016, Party H submitted a letter of intent to acquire Lumos Networks for $16.00—$17.00 per share, while orally
informing representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS that it could not meet the Board’s valuation expectations. No further
discussions occurred between the Company and Party H. In late December Party L informed representatives of Wells Fargo Securities
and UBS that it was not going to pursue a transaction.

The Board met by conference call on December 28, 2016, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS
and Troutman Sanders, to review the status of the discussions with the various parties. The Board also reviewed management’s updated
five year operating model (see “—Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 58). Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and
UBS reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses of Party A and the Company. The Board discussed potential conditions to
granting EQT exclusivity. The Board received information from management about the federal regulatory approval process that would
be required for a transaction with EQT due to EQT’s foreign ownership.

The Strategic Committee met by conference call on January 3, 2017, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo
Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, in order to prepare for a meeting of the Board to be held later that day. The Strategic
Committee received an update on discussions with Party A and EQT.

Later on January 3, the Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and
Troutman Sanders, to receive further updates on events since December 28, 2016. The Board determined to request follow-up
information regarding EQT’s letter of intent. Representatives of Troutman Sanders reviewed possible terms of a merger agreement,
including a possible “go shop” and termination scenarios and termination fees.

That same day Party G notified representatives of our financial advisors that it had determined not to participate in further discussions.
Party A also told representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS that it could value Lumos Networks at $17.25 per share in a part
stock/part cash transaction, but that it did not intend to perform any additional due diligence at that point in light of the fact that this
offer may not be competitive and that it may not remain interested in a transaction with the Company at a later date given other
transactions it was considering.

On January 4, 2017, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party F. During the subsequent week Party F advised us that they
were not going to pursue discussions about a transaction.

On January 4, 2017, the Company closed on its acquisition of Clarity.

On January 4, 2017, a representative of EQT contacted Mr. Guth to discuss next steps.

On January 4, 2017, Troutman Sanders distributed a first draft of the Merger Agreement to EQT. In addition, representatives of the
financial advisors communicated to representatives of EQT the Board’s requests for additional information before the Board could
approve exclusivity, including (1) a Merger Agreement issues list, (2) additional financing information, (3) the approval status for the
transaction within the EQT organization, (4) the status of the new fund being raised by EQT, (5) whether it was a condition to EQT’s
offer that the Company’s management remain with the Company following closing of a transaction, and (6) information about the
federal regulatory approval process in light of EQT’s foreign ownership.

On January 6, 2017, Party A informed Wells Fargo Securities and UBS that it could not meet the Board’s valuation expectations.

During early January, Mr. Biltz met a representative of Party F at an industry conference, which meeting was followed by due diligence
requests from Party F. During this period, Party I notified us that it had determined not to participate in further discussions with the
Company. Additionally, the Company did not hear further from Party E.

On January 7, 2017, a representative of EQT contacted Mr. Biltz to provide a preview of EQT’s responses to the Board’s request for
additional information.

On January 9, 2017, EQT provided responses to the Board’s questions and its counsel Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, which we
refer to as “Simpson Thacher,” identified high level issues regarding the Company’s initial Merger Agreement draft, including
(1) whether the Merger Agreement would provide for a “go-shop” period, (2) the amount of the termination fee payable by the
Company and whether such termination fee would be an exclusive remedy, (3) the amount of the reverse termination fee payable by
EQT, (4) the terms of the covenant relating to EQT’s obligation to obtain regulatory approvals and whether a termination fee would be
payable by EQT for failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals, (5) EQT’s request for reimbursement of expenses in the event the
Company breaches the Merger Agreement or the Company’s stockholders do not vote in favor the Merger, and (6) the Merger
Agreement closing conditions. EQT again requested that the Company enter into an exclusivity agreement. Representatives from EQT
and Lumos Networks and their advisors continued to hold due diligence meetings. Included in these meetings were a regulatory
information call with the Company’s and EQT’s respective legal advisors and a call providing information on the status of EQT’s new
fund.

The Committee met by conference call on January 9 and 10, 2017, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo
Securities, UBS and Troutman Sanders, to review EQT’s high level issues list and its responses to the request for additional
information and to prepare for a Board meeting.

Representatives of Troutman Sanders and Simpson Thacher held a conference call on January 10, 2017 to review EQT’s high level
issues list.

On January 11, 2017, the Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and
Troutman Sanders, and received an update from the Strategic Committee and the financial advisors on the status of the market check
process and a report on EQT’s responses to the Board’s questions and the Merger Agreement high level issues raised by EQT.
Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS reported that the other highest offer received was for $17.25 a share from Party A
and that Party A’s offer seemed uncertain since Party A had discontinued due diligence. Representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and
UBS reviewed their preliminary financial analysis of the Company. The Board discussed that EQT had indicated in its responses to the
Board’s questions that it was EQT’s preference for the current management team to continue leading the Company, although such
continuation would not be a condition to closing. Additionally, in discussions about EQT’s responses, representatives of EQT had
indicated to representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS that they desired to talk with Mr. Biltz about his and other members of
management’s post closing employment arrangements. Following discussion of the responses provided by EQT and taking into account
EQT’s offer price compared to others the Company had received, the Board authorized management to enter into an exclusivity
agreement with EQT. The Board determined that following execution of the exclusivity agreement, the objectives behind forming the
Strategic Committee would have been achieved. However, in light of EQT’s desire to talk with Mr. Biltz about post-closing
employment arrangements, the Board designated two independent directors, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Sicoli, to work with Troutman

On January 12, 2017, Troutman Sanders delivered the Company’s response to EQT’s high level issues list.

On January 13, 2017, we entered into an exclusivity agreement with EQT that extended until February 13, 2017. Thereafter, EQT and
its representatives and the Company and its representatives engaged in confirmatory due diligence up until the execution of the Merger
Agreement.

On January 18 and 23, 2017, Simpson Thacher and Troutman Sanders exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement to address
open matters not covered in the high level issues list.

On January 25, 2017, the Board met in Richmond, Virginia, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS
and Troutman Sanders, and reviewed the Company’s proposed 2017 operating plan prepared by management. Representatives of Wells
Fargo Securities and UBS reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of the Company relating to EQT’s offer of $18.00 per share.
The Board also discussed responses to significant open issues in the Merger Agreement with its legal and financial advisors, including
the “go shop” and the termination fee amounts. In light of the market check that had occurred as well as the 2014 sale process, and of
the importance of certainty of closing, the Board authorized its advisers to relinquish the “go shop” in exchange for obtaining a
reasonable Company termination fee and an EQT “reverse” termination fee equal to two times the Company termination fee. Also, in
light of the additional comfort it had received on the federal regulatory approval process from legal advisors, the Board was willing to
forego a regulatory termination fee. Troutman Sanders representatives reviewed information relating to the interests of executive
officers in the Merger and the impact on Pamplona of the transaction, both resulting from publicly disclosed change in control
arrangements, including (1) information with respect to officers and directors of the type set forth in “—Interests of the Directors and
Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger” beginning on page 64 and (2) the fact that Pamplona’s Warrant would become
exerciseable for 1,222,278 shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock and the 8% Notes will be prepaid at 108% of their principal
amount in the Merger.

On January 30, 2017, Simpson Thacher provided a mark-up of the Merger Agreement to Troutman Sanders.

Mr. Biltz met with representatives of EQT and representatives from the parties’ respective financial advisors during an industry
conference on January 30, 2017 to discuss EQT’s plans for retaining management of the Company. As a result of EQT’s statement of
the importance of our CEO participating in management post-closing, our Board authorized EQT to provide an overview of its
management participation program to be shared with Mr. Guth, Mr. Robinson, Troutman Sanders and Mr. Biltz.

On February 2, 2017, we announced the completion of our acquisition of DC74.

On February 2, 2017 the Board met by conference call, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and
Troutman Sanders. Representatives of Troutman Sanders reviewed significant open issues in the Merger Agreement, including new
issues posed by Simpson Thacher’s mark-up. Following discussion, the Board authorized representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and
UBS to communicate to EQT that the Board would agree to the following changes to the Merger Agreement: (1) remove the
“go-shop,” (2) set the Company termination fee at 3.5% of equity value, (3) set EQT’s reverse termination fee at 7% of equity value,
and (4) remove the regulatory termination fee. In agreeing to these changes, the Board directed the advisors to communicate that it is
expecting EQT to participate in constructive negotiations of the remaining Merger Agreement issues. EQT agreed to this proposal on
February 3 and on February 4, 2017 Troutman Sanders prepared an updated Merger Agreement issues list that was provided to
Simpson Thacher.

Also on February 6, 2017, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a draft of the equity commitment letter and termination equity
commitment letter to Troutman Sanders and discussed Merger Agreement issues. The parties exchanged drafts of the Merger
Agreement and ancillary documents, including disclosure schedules, and negotiated remaining issues throughout that week.

On February 6, 2017, EQT provided a presentation on its management participation program and a draft of a term sheet to Mr. Biltz,
with copies being provided to Mr. Guth, Mr. Robinson and Troutman Sanders as requested by the Board so it would be informed about
EQT’s discussions with management. The parties, along with representatives from UBS, Wells Fargo Securities and Troutman Sanders,
discussed these materials by conference call with EQT later that day. On February 7, 2017, EQT provided additional information to Mr.
Biltz about the management participation program, with copies being provided to Mr. Guth, Mr. Robinson and Troutman Sanders. On
February 10, 2017, Mr. Biltz shared with Mr. Guth, Mr. Robinson and Troutman Sanders his proposed response to EQT’s presentation.
On February 11, 2017, representatives of EQT met with Mr. Biltz, with Mr. Guth present, to continue discussions on the management
participation program. Following several discussions between February 11 and February 14, on February 14, 2017, EQT and Mr. Biltz
agreed in principle to a management incentive plan that contemplated, among other things, (1) an equity pool of 9% of the equity of the
surviving corporation in the form of a stock option plan, (2) a $2 million investment by Mr. Biltz, and (3) that the equity acquired by

management would be subject to certain transfer restrictions and call rights of Parent, and would also be granted certain registration
rights. Mr. Biltz informed Mr. Guth, Mr. Robinson and Troutman Sanders about this agreement in principle on February 14 and
provided the term sheet reflecting this agreement in principle to them on February 15. (For a summary of this term sheet, see “Interests

The Board met by conference call on February 13, 2017, together with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS
and Troutman Sanders. The advisors provided an update on numerous items, including due diligence matters, Merger Agreement
negotiations and the status of the equity and debt financing commitment letters. The Board discussed various matters relating to the
EQT Merger Agreement, including (1) what the “end date” should be in the Merger Agreement in light of the federal regulatory
approval process and (2) the need for firm debt financing commitments. In light of the progress being made in the negotiations, the
Board determined to extend the exclusivity period, subject to EQT’s investment committee indicating its support for the transaction.
Following the Board call on February 13, representatives of EQT informed representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS that its
investment committee had met that day and indicated its support for the transaction.

Over the following days, representatives of the Company and EQT and their respective legal advisors negotiated the remaining points
on the Merger Agreement, including (1) EQT’s financing and regulatory covenants, (2) expense reimbursement provisions in the event
Company stockholders did not approve the transaction and (3) interim operating covenants.

Following a discussion with management regarding the final 2017 business plan, the Company’s 2016 results and the addition of the
then-completed acquisitions of Clarity and DC74, the Board authorized the use of the “updated projections” referred to in “—Certain
Financial Projections” beginning on page 58 for use in the financial analysis being performed by Wells Fargo Securities and UBS.

On February 17, 2017, the Board met by conference call with representatives of management, Wells Fargo Securities, UBS and
Troutman Sanders present. At this meeting:

Board meeting;
 

 
•  representatives of Troutman Sanders reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties when considering the proposed

transaction;

EQT and its representatives and the revised terms and conditions of the proposed Merger Agreement, including as to
(1) EQT’s financing and regulatory covenants, (2) expense reimbursement provisions in the event Company stockholders
did not approve the transaction and (3) interim operating covenants;

 

 

•  representatives of Troutman Sanders reviewed the EQT term sheet with Mr. Biltz, information relating to interest of officers
and directors in the transaction and information relating to the impact on Pamplona of the transaction, both resulting from
publicly disclosed change in control arrangements and again reviewed the fact that Pamplona’s Warrant would become
exerciseable for 1,222,278 shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock and the 8% Notes will be prepaid at 108% of their
principal amount in the Merger; and

 

 
•  representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of the Company and EQT’s

offer of $18.00 cash per share.

Following this discussion, the Board determined to reconvene over the weekend once the Merger Agreement negotiations had been
completed.

EQT and the Company ultimately agreed to terms on the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents on February 18, 2017.

received in the Merger by holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than Parent and Lumos Networks and its
subsidiaries and, in the case of UBS’s opinion, holders of dissenting shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. See “—Opinions of Financial Advisors” beginning on page 50.

Our Board considered various reasons to approve the Merger Agreement (see “—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and
Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 47), including certain countervailing factors. After discussions with its financial and legal
advisors and members of our senior management, and in light of the reasons considered, the Board members voting on the transaction:

the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger;

The Board recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the merger proposal, approving the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger; (ii) “FOR” the adjournment proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Merger-related named executive
officer compensation proposal.

When you consider the Board’s recommendation, you should be aware that our directors may have interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. These interests are described below under “—Interests of the
Directors and Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger” beginning on page 64.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Board consulted with Lumos Networks’ executive management regarding the business and
financial condition of Lumos Networks, trends in Lumos Networks’ industry, future prospects and the terms and conditions of the
Merger. In addition, the Board consulted with Lumos Networks’ outside legal advisors, Troutman Sanders, regarding the proposed
terms and conditions of the Merger and the obligations of the members of the Board in their consideration of the Merger and related
transactions, and Lumos Networks’ financial advisors, Wells Fargo Securities and UBS regarding the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Lumos Networks’ stockholders of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock in
the Merger. In the course of reaching its determination to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and to recommend that the
stockholders vote in favor of the Merger, the Board carefully considered numerous potentially positive factors, including, without
limitation, the following factors (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):
 

 

•  the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium of 18.2% to the February 17, 2017 closing price of Lumos
Networks Common Stock, a premium of 34.9% to the volume-weighted price average of the 12 months ended February 17,
2017 and a premium of 16.5% to the average closing price of the last 20 trading days before the Merger Agreement was
announced;

 

 

•  the belief of the Board, after a thorough review of Lumos Networks’ business, market trends, results of operations,
competitive landscape, execution risks and financial condition, and discussions with Lumos Networks’ management and
advisors, that the value offered to stockholders pursuant to the Merger is more favorable to our stockholders than the
potential long-term and sustainable value that might have resulted from remaining an independent public company,
considering:

 

 •  the outlook of Lumos Networks’ industry and market, including consolidation in the fiber/bandwidth industry;
 

 •  the execution and other risks and uncertainties relating to future execution of Lumos Networks’ strategic plan;
 

 •  challenges of achieving consolidated growth rates necessary to meet financial projections;
 

 
•  costs and risks of other strategic alternatives, including expected breakage costs of a potential separation of the

LEC business;
 

 
•  the competitive environment in the telecommunications industry, and specifically in the FTTC and enterprise

businesses, resulting in increasing pricing pressure;
 

 •  the reduced visibility of the timing and size of potential new FTTC business; and
 

 •  risks inherent with a smaller market capitalization company, including trading liquidity;
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger Consideration of $18.00 per share will be paid in cash, and provides certainty, immediate value and

liquidity to our stockholders;
 

 

•  the fact that the Merger Consideration, along with Lumos Networks’ current net debt and certain change of control
payments, represents an enterprise value of approximately $950 million and an implied multiple of 9.5x to pro forma
EBITDA (as defined below in the section entitled “—Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 58) for the 12
months ended December 31, 2016, 9.4x to projected 2017 EBITDA and 8.7x to projected 2018 EBITDA;

•  the alternatives evaluated and considered by Lumos Networks, in consultation with its advisors, including (i) continuing to

run the Company in the ordinary course, (ii) divestiture of the LEC business and (iii) selling the Company;
 

 
•  the market check activities conducted as discussed above under “—Background of the Merger” and the number of potential

strategic and financial bidders solicited prior to the signing of the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the course of negotiations between Lumos Networks and EQT, in which Lumos Networks was advised by independent legal

and financial advisors, which resulted in an increase from the $17.50 price per share initially offered by EQT to $18.00 per
share, which price was confirmed following substantial due diligence by EQT;

 

 
•  the belief of the Board based upon arm’s-length negotiations with EQT that the price to be paid by EQT was the highest

price per share that EQT was willing to pay for Lumos Networks and the fact that other bidders declined to make an offer
equal to or above such price;

 

 
•  the benefits that Lumos Networks and its advisors were able to obtain during their extensive negotiations with EQT and that

the Merger Agreement was a product of arm’s-length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that were, in the
Board’s view, advisable and favorable to our stockholders;

 

 

•  the oral opinion delivered by Wells Fargo Securities to the Board on February 18, 2017, which opinion was subsequently

February 18, 2017 and based on and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations
described in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock
(other than Parent and Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders, as more fully described below under the caption “—Opinions of Financial Advisors” beginning on page 50. The full
text of the written opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, dated February 18, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the
procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters
considered in rendering the opinion, is attached as Appendix D to this proxy statement;

 

 

•  the oral opinion delivered by UBS to the Board on February 18, 2017, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of its written opinion addressed to the Board, dated February 18, 2017, to the effect that, as of February 18, 2017
and based on and subject to various assumptions made, matters considered and limitations described in its written opinion,
the Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than holders of
dissenting shares, Parent and Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders,
as more fully described below under the caption “—Opinions of Financial Advisors” beginning on page 50. The full text of
the written opinion of UBS, dated February 18, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, factors and matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in rendering the opinion, is
attached as Appendix E to this proxy statement;

 

 

•  the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based on, among other things, the likelihood of receiving the Lumos
Networks stockholder approval necessary to complete the Merger in a timely manner, the limited number of conditions to
the Merger, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the remedies available under the Merger
Agreement to Lumos Networks in the event of various breaches of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub;

 

 •  the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and other transaction agreements, including the following related factors:
 

 

•  the ability of the Board under the Merger Agreement to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, including in
connection with a superior proposal, and our right to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a
superior proposal and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such superior proposal, in both cases
subject to payment of a customary termination fee;

Table of Contents

 
•  the conclusion of the Board that the termination fees and the circumstances when such termination fees may be

payable are reasonable in light of the benefit of the Merger and would not be a significant impediment to third
parties interested in making a superior proposal;

 

 

•  the right of Lumos Networks and the Board to respond to a competing acquisition proposal from any bidder
prior to obtaining the stockholder approval if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal
or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law;

 

 •  the absence of a financing condition to Parent and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the Merger;
 

 
•  the fact that Parent has received equity and debt commitment letters that will be sufficient for Parent to

consummate the Merger;
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger Agreement provides that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated

under certain circumstances, and as an alternative to specific performance under the Merger Agreement, Parent
will pay us a termination fee of approximately $32 million, without our having to establish any damages;

 

 •  the fact that the definition of “material adverse effect” contains customary exceptions;
 

 

•  the fact that pursuant to the Merger Agreement we are entitled to specific performance and other equitable
remedies to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement, and can, under appropriate circumstances, enforce
Parent’s obligation to enforce the equity commitment letter in order to cause the equity financing to be timely
completed; and

 

 
•  the availability of statutory appraisal rights to our stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the

Merger Agreement and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL.

The Board also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):
 

 •  the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on our actively soliciting competing bids to acquire Lumos Networks;
 

 

•  that, under certain circumstances in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay
Parent a termination fee of approximately $16 million and, if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Lumos
Networks stockholders do not approve the transaction, we will be required to reimburse Parent up to $3.5 million in
expenses;

 

 
•  the fact that Lumos Networks stockholders will not participate in any potential future earnings or growth of Lumos

Networks and will not benefit from any appreciation in the value of the Company as a private company;
 

 
•  the fact that there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied and, as a

result, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, even if the Merger Agreement is
adopted by the Lumos Networks stockholders;

 

 •  the potential negative effects if the Merger is not consummated, including:
 

 •  the trading price of Lumos Networks Common Stock could be adversely affected;
 

 •  we will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs attempting to consummate the Merger;
 

 
•  we could lose customers, suppliers, business partners and employees, including key sales and other personnel,

after the announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  our business may be subject to significant disruption and decline;
 

 •  the market’s perceptions of Lumos Networks’ prospects could be adversely affected; and

Table of Contents

 
•  Lumos Networks’ directors, officers and other employees will have expended considerable time and effort to

consummate the Merger;
 

 

•  the fact that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets other than equity and debt
commitments, and that, notwithstanding our specific performance remedy under the Merger Agreement, our remedy in the
event of breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub may be limited to receipt of the termination fee provided
under the Merger Agreement, and that under certain circumstances we may not be entitled to a termination fee at all;

 

 

•  the termination fee payable by Lumos Networks to Parent upon the occurrence of certain events, including the potential
effect of such termination fee to deter other potential acquirers from making a competing proposal for Lumos Networks that
might be more advantageous to our stockholders, and the impact of the termination fee on our ability to engage in another
transaction if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances;

 

 
•  the fact that the gain realized by our stockholders as a result of the Merger generally will be taxable to the stockholders for

U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which

may delay or prevent us from undertaking business or other opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the
Merger; and

 

 
•  the fact that our executive officers and directors may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition

to, those of our stockholders. See “—Interests of the Directors and Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger” beginning on
page 64.

After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the risks, uncertainties,
restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger to
Lumos Networks’ stockholders. Accordingly, all members of the Board voting on the Merger determined that the Merger, Merger
Agreement and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders.

The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors
considered by the Board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the Merger, the Board did
not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching their
determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the
process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to
whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support their ultimate determinations. The Board based
their recommendations on the totality of the information presented, including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Lumos
Networks’ senior management and outside financial advisors and legal counsel. It should be noted that this explanation of the
reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the
factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 27.

Opinions of Financial Advisors

Lumos Networks retained Wells Fargo Securities and UBS as its Financial Advisors to advise the Board in connection with the Merger.
Pursuant to the respective engagements of each of Wells Fargo Securities and UBS, Lumos Networks requested each of Wells Fargo
Securities and UBS to evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other
than Parent and Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries, and in the case of the opinion of UBS, holders of dissenting shares) of the
Merger Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

adverse effect on Lumos Networks or the Merger in any way meaningful to its analyses.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions existing, and the
information made available to it, as of the date of its opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect the matters set forth in
Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion, Wells Fargo Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion
or otherwise comment on or consider any such events occurring or coming to its attention after the date of its opinion.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Lumos Networks Common
Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and did not address
any other terms, aspects of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any tax or accounting matters
relating to the Merger or otherwise, any financing arrangements or any aspect or implication of any other agreement or arrangement
entered into in connection with or contemplated by the Merger or otherwise. In addition, its opinion did not address the fairness of the
amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any
parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Wells Fargo Securities did not
express any opinion with respect to any amounts or consideration to be received by, or paid or not paid, to the holders of the cancelled
shares in connection with the Merger.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion does not address the merits (financial or otherwise) of the underlying decision by Lumos Networks to
enter into the Merger Agreement or the relative merits of the Merger compared with other business strategies or transactions available
or that have been or might be considered by the management or the Board or in which Lumos Networks might engage. Wells Fargo
Securities did not express any view, opinion or interpretation as to matters that require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax,
environmental, employee compensation or other similar professional advice. Wells Fargo Securities assumed that Lumos Networks has
or will obtain such opinions, counsel or interpretations from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Wells Fargo Securities has,
with our consent, relied upon the assessments of Lumos Networks and its advisors as to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax
and environmental matters with respect to Lumos Networks and the Merger. Wells Fargo Securities’ opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to the Board or to any other person or entity in respect of the Merger or otherwise, including, without limitation, as to
how any holder of Lumos Networks Common Stock should vote or act in connection with any matter relating to the Merger, the
Merger Agreement or any other matters.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses, including
those summarized below. This summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed and factors considered in
connection with such opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Wells Fargo Securities made its determinations as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (excluding the
cancelled shares) in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses taken as
a whole.

In performing its analyses, Wells Fargo Securities considered general business, economic, industry and market conditions, financial
and otherwise, and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. No company, transaction or
business used in Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses for comparative purposes is identical to Lumos Networks or the proposed Merger and
an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. The financial analyses performed by Wells Fargo Securities
were performed for analytical purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value
of assets, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may
be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Lumos Networks.

While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall conclusion with respect to fairness, Wells Fargo
Securities did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. Much of the information used in, and
accordingly the results of, Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Wells Fargo Securities’
opinion was only one of many factors considered by our Board in evaluating the proposed Merger. Neither Wells Fargo Securities’
opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the Merger Consideration or of the views of our Board or management with respect to
the Merger or the Merger Consideration. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger were determined through
negotiation between the representatives of Lumos Networks and the representatives of Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger
Agreement was solely that of our Board.

Wells Fargo Securities is the trade name for certain capital markets and investment banking services of Wells Fargo & Company and its
subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Wells Fargo Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
which is regularly engaged in providing financial advisory services in connection with mergers and acquisitions. The issuance of Wells
Fargo Securities’ opinion was approved by an authorized committee of Wells Fargo Securities. The Company has agreed to pay Wells
Fargo Securities for its financial advisory services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be
approximately $8.5 million, a portion of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and approximately $7.5 million of which is
contingent upon consummation of the Merger.

Wells Fargo Securities and its affiliates provide a full range of investment banking and financial advisory, securities trading, brokerage
and lending services in the ordinary course of business, for which Wells Fargo Securities and such affiliates receive customary fees. In
that regard, Wells Fargo Securities or its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing or in the future may provide

fees, including, during the past two years, having acted as financial advisor to Lumos Networks in connection with a strategic
investment, for which Wells Fargo Securities received aggregate fees of $6 million. During the past two years, no material relationship
existed between Wells Fargo Securities and Parent or Parent’s affiliates for which any compensation was received or is expected to be
received by Wells Fargo Securities. In the ordinary course of business, Wells Fargo Securities and its affiliates may actively trade or
otherwise effect transactions in or hold the securities or financial instruments of Lumos Networks, Parent, EQT, and/or certain of their
respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities or financial instruments.

Opinion of UBS Securities LLC

On February 18, 2017, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the Merger, UBS delivered to the Board an oral opinion, which
opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated February 18, 2017, to the effect that, as of February 18,
2017 and based on and subject to various assumptions made, matters considered and limitations described in its written opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than holders of dissenting
shares, Parent and Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of UBS’s written opinion to the Board describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by UBS. This opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E and is
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock are encouraged to read this
opinion carefully in its entirety. UBS’s opinion was provided for the benefit of Lumos Networks’ board of directors (in its
capacity as such) in connection with, and for the purpose of, the Board’s evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock (other than holders of dissenting shares, Parent and Lumos Networks
and its subsidiaries) of the Merger Consideration, and did not address any other aspect or implication of the Merger or the
Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the relative merits of the Merger or any related transaction as compared to
other business strategies or transactions that might be available with respect to Lumos Networks, or Lumos Networks’
underlying business decision to effect the Merger or any related transaction. UBS’s opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Lumos Networks Common Stock as to how such holder should vote or act with respect to the
Merger or any related transaction.

In arriving at its opinion, UBS, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Lumos Networks;
 

 
•  reviewed certain internal financial information and other data relating to the business and financial prospects of Lumos

Networks that were not publicly available, including updated financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management
of Lumos Networks that Lumos Networks directed UBS to utilize for purposes of its analysis;

 

 
•  conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Lumos Networks concerning the business and financial

prospects of Lumos Networks;
 

 
•  performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Lumos Networks in which UBS analyzed the future cash flows of Lumos

Networks using the updated financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of Lumos Networks;
 

 
•  reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect to certain other companies UBS believed to be

generally relevant;
 

 
•  compared the financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions UBS

believed to be generally relevant;

 •  reviewed current and historical market prices of Lumos Networks Common Stock;
 

 
•  reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement captioned “Execution Version” provided for UBS’s review on February 18, 2017;

and
 

 
•  conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other information, as UBS deemed

necessary or appropriate.

In connection with UBS’s review, with the consent of the Board, UBS assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness in all material respects of the information provided to or reviewed by UBS for the purpose of its opinion. In
addition, with the consent of the Board, UBS did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Lumos Networks, nor was UBS furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

With respect to the updated financial forecasts and estimates referred to above, UBS assumed, at Lumos Networks’ direction, that they
were reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
Lumos Networks as to the future financial performance of Lumos Networks. In addition, UBS assumed with Lumos Networks’
approval that the updated financial forecasts and estimates referred to above will be achieved at the times and in the amounts projected.
UBS further relied upon and assumed at Lumos Networks’ direction, without independent verification, that there were no changes in
the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of Lumos Networks since the
respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to UBS except for such
changes as would not be material to UBS’s analysis or opinion, and that there was no information or any facts that would make any of
the information discussed with or reviewed by UBS incomplete or misleading. UBS’s opinion was necessarily based on economic,
monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information available to UBS as of, the date of its opinion.

In rendering its opinion, UBS assumed, with the consent of Lumos Networks, that (i) the final executed form of the Merger Agreement
would not differ in any material respect from the draft provided for UBS’s review on February 18, 2017, that UBS reviewed, (ii) the
parties to the Merger Agreement will comply with all material terms of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant
documents or requirements, without any adverse waiver, modification or amendment of any material term or condition thereof. UBS
also assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be
obtained without any material adverse effect on Lumos Networks, Parent or the Merger.

UBS did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that may result from the Merger, nor did its opinion address any
legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. UBS was not asked to address, and did not offer any opinion as to the terms, other than the
Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion, of the Merger Agreement or any related documents or the
structure or form of the Merger or any related transaction. In addition, UBS expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such
persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise.

UBS acted as a financial advisor to Lumos Networks in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
Merger. Under the terms of UBS’s engagement, Lumos Networks agreed to pay UBS for its financial advisory services in connection
with the Merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately $4.8 million, approximately $0.8 million of which has been
paid in connection with UBS’s opinion and approximately $4.0 million of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In
addition, Lumos Networks agreed to reimburse certain of UBS’s expenses arising, and indemnify UBS against certain liabilities that
may arise, out of its engagement. Except for investment banking services to Lumos Networks in connection with the Merger, in the
past two years no material relationship existed between UBS and any of Lumos Networks, Parent or the EQT Fund for which any
compensation was received or is expected to be received by UBS. Since January 2015, European affiliates of UBS provided certain
investment banking services to certain portfolio companies affiliated with EQT located outside of the United States for which such
UBS affiliates received customary fees aggregating approximately $15.5 million, and in the future UBS and its affiliates may provide
additional investment banking services to companies affiliated with EQT for which UBS and its affiliates may receive compensation.
In the ordinary course of business, UBS and its affiliates may hold or trade, for their own accounts and the accounts of their customers,
securities of Lumos Networks and Parent, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Without
limiting the foregoing, as of February 28, 2017, the UBS group owned shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock representing less
than 0.07% of the outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. The issuance of the UBS opinion was approved by an
authorized committee of UBS.

Summary of Financial Analyses of Lumos Networks’ Financial Advisors

The following is a summary of certain of the financial analyses performed by Wells Fargo Securities and UBS in connection with the
preparation of their respective opinions and reviewed with our Board on February 18, 2017. The summary does not contain all of the
financial data that holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock may want or need for purposes of making an independent determination
of fair value. Holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock are encouraged to consult their own financial and other advisors before
making any investment decision in connection with the proposed Merger. The order of the analyses summarized below does not
represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by either Wells Fargo Securities or UBS. The analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses.
Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies
underlying, and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create an incomplete view of Wells Fargo
Securities’ and UBS’s analyses.

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and involves various quantitative and qualitative determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant methods of financial, comparative, and analytical methods and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances. Therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Each of Wells Fargo
Securities and UBS arrived at their respective opinions based on the results of all analyses undertaken by them and assessed as a whole
and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis, methodology or factor. Accordingly, Wells
Fargo Securities and UBS believe that their analyses and the following summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all analyses, methodologies and factors or the narrative
description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Wells Fargo Securities’ and
UBS’ analyses and their respective opinions.

For purposes of their analyses, Wells Fargo Securities and UBS reviewed a number of financial metrics, including the following:
 

 
•  EBITDA – generally the amount of the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-

based compensation, pension expense, any non-recurring items and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests for a
specified time period.

 

 

•  Enterprise Value – generally the value as of a specified date of the relevant company’s outstanding equity securities (taking
into account outstanding options and other securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into or for equity securities of
the company) plus the value as of such date of its net debt (the value of its outstanding indebtedness, capital lease
obligations and non-controlling interests less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet).

Unless the context indicates otherwise, (i) the enterprise values used in the selected companies analyses described below were
calculated using the market price of the common stock of the selected companies listed below as of February 16, 2017, (ii) the relevant
values for the selected transactions analysis described below were calculated on an enterprise value basis based on the consideration
proposed to be paid in the selected transactions, and (iii) the estimates of the future financial performance of Lumos Networks relied
upon for the financial analyses described below were based on the updated financial projections provided by Lumos Networks’
management, and estimates of the future financial performance for the selected companies listed below were based on certain publicly
available research analyst estimates for those companies.

Lumos Networks’ FY 2017E EBITDA, and $12.37 to $17.94 based on Lumos Networks’ FY 2018E EBITDA, as compared to the
proposed Merger Consideration in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement of $18.00 per share.

as compared to the proposed Merger Consideration in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement of $18.00.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Wells Fargo Securities and UBS conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Lumos Networks using the updated financial forecasts
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, including projected utilization of net
operating losses, provided by Lumos Networks’ management, to determine an implied present value per share of Lumos Networks
Common Stock as of December 31, 2016. In conducting this analysis, Wells Fargo Securities and UBS first calculated the net present
value of the projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for Lumos Networks for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 through
the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Next, Wells Fargo Securities and UBS derived implied terminal values for Lumos
Networks in the fiscal year 2021 by applying a range of terminal value EBITDA multiples of 9.0x to 10.0x, which were chosen by
Wells Fargo Securities and UBS based on their experience and professional judgment, to the estimated EBITDA of Lumos Networks
for the fiscal year 2021 provided by the management of Lumos Networks. The unlevered free cash flows and range of terminal values
were discounted to present values using a range of discount rates from 8.0% to 9.0%. Wells Fargo Securities and UBS selected the
discount range used in this analysis based on their experience and professional judgment taking into account Lumos Networks’
weighted average cost of capital, which Wells Fargo Securities and UBS calculated using standard corporate finance methodologies.
Wells Fargo Securities and UBS then derived a range of implied enterprise values of Lumos Networks by adding the present value (as
of December 31, 2016) of the projected cash flows of Lumos Networks for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 through the full
fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 to the present value (as of December 31, 2016) of the terminal value for Lumos Networks in
fiscal year 2021. For purposes of these present value calculations, Wells Fargo Securities and UBS utilized the mid-year cash flow
convention. Wells Fargo Securities and UBS calculated a range of implied per share values for Lumos Networks by subtracting Lumos
Networks’ estimated net debt ($461 million) and other line items (totaling approximately $16 million) including unfunded pension and
post-retirement obligations, non-controlling interest and equity investments as of December 31, 2016 (as provided by Lumos
Networks’ management) and adding the estimated net present value of Lumos Networks’ net operating losses as of December 31, 2016
to the range of implied enterprise values of Lumos Networks and then dividing by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding (as of
February 16, 2017). These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of Lumos Networks Common Stock of
$15.70 to $19.93. Wells Fargo Securities and UBS noted that the per-share Merger Consideration to be paid in connection with the
Merger is $18.00.

Certain Financial Projections

Lumos Networks does not, as a matter of course, develop or publicly disclose long-term projections or internal projections of its future
financial performance, financial condition or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions
and estimates, though Lumos Networks has in the past provided investors with full-year financial guidance which may cover areas

such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures, among other items, which it may update from time to time during the
relevant year. However, in connection with Lumos Networks’ evaluation of a

possible transaction, Lumos Networks prepared and provided the Board and its advisors, including Wells Fargo Securities and UBS, in
performing their respective financial analyses, including the financial analyses summarized under “—Opinions of Financial Advisors”
beginning on page 50, with certain non-public, unaudited, stand-alone financial projections prepared by management and not for public
disclosure. Lumos Networks management prepared four variations of financial projections, which we refer to together as the
Management Projections: (i) preliminary operating model projections prepared in October 2016 in preparation for the strategic
alternative process described earlier and provided to the Board and the Financial Advisors, which we refer to as the initial projections,
(ii) updated operating model projections prepared in November 2016 and provided to the Board and the Financial Advisors, which we
refer to as the interim projections, (iii) investment case projections prepared in connection with the strategic alternative process and
provided to the Board and potential strategic partners participating in the process (including EQT) beginning in November 2016, which
we refer to as the investment case projections, and (iv) revised operating model projections prepared in February 2017 reflecting
updated results and management expectations and provided to the Board and the Financial Advisors, which we refer to as the updated
projections. The interim projections updated the initial projections to reflect management’s continuing analysis of the operating model
and projected performance. The Committee and the Board determined that management should prepare on a reasonable good faith
basis the investment case projections based on the initial projections with adjustments to reflect (1) an increase in dark fiber and
wavelength sales in future years as a result of increases in FTTC backhaul traffic and backhaul traffic from the Norfolk underwater
cable landing site, (2) a higher number of second tenants on FTTC sites, resulting from an increase in demand for denser mobile
networks and (3) a moderated CLEC voice services customer churn in future years. While the acquisition of DC74 was included in the
initial projections, that acquisition was not included in the interim projections or the investment case projections prepared in November
2016, given the relative uncertainty of the transaction at the time. The updated projections reflected updates relating to estimated 2016
financial results, the 2017 operating model and the projected performance of the recently acquired Clarity and DC74. The updated
projections were used for purposes of the financial analyses provided by the Financial Advisors, summarized above under the caption
“—Opinions of Financial Advisors” beginning on page 50.

The following tables summarize the Management Projections as described above.

The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because
such information was made available as described above. The Projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP,” the published guidelines of the SEC
regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Furthermore, KPMG LLP, our independent auditor,
has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to, the Management Projections and, accordingly, assumes no
responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The Management Projections included in this proxy statement have been
prepared by, and are the responsibility of, our management. The Management Projections were prepared solely for internal use of
Lumos Networks and its Financial Advisors and are subjective in many respects. The investment case projections were prepared solely
for the use of potential strategic partners and are also subjective in many respects.

Although a summary of the Management Projections is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous variables,
assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the
Management Projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at the time. However,
this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that
may affect actual results and cause the Management Projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, results or
financial condition, industry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows,
competitive pressures, current expansion efforts adversely impacting our business or results, ability to successfully integrate
acquisitions, pricing pressures from our customers adversely affecting our profitability, technological changes and competition
adversely affecting our sales, profitability or financial condition, any disruption in our information technology systems adversely
impacting our business and operations, strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
impacting our results, our contingent liabilities and tax matters causing us to incur losses or costs, any inability to protect our
intellectual property rights adversely affecting our business or our competitive position, costs or adverse effects on our business,
reputation or results from governmental regulations, changes in government regulation or other policies adversely affecting our
revenue and profitability, work stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or those of our customers or vendors adversely affecting
our business, results or financial condition, and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Management Projections do not take into account
any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can
be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those
contained in the Management Projections. Since the Management Projections cover multiple years, that information by its nature
becomes less predictive with each successive year. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the
Board, Lumos Networks, our Financial Advisors, Parent, Parent’s representatives and affiliates (including EQT and the EQT Fund) or
any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management Projections to be material information of Lumos
Networks or that actual future results will necessarily reflect the Management Projections, and the Management Projections should not
be relied upon as such. The summary of the Management Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any
stockholder to vote in favor of the merger proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence
any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with
respect to shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock.

The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements, risk factors and other
information regarding Lumos Networks contained in our public filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 169.

Table of Contents

The Management Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Lumos Networks’ future
results to materially vary, see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 27.

Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to
update or otherwise revise the Management Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when Lumos Networks prepared
the Management Projections or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even
in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be in error. By including in this proxy
statement a summary of certain financial projections, neither Lumos Networks nor any of its representatives or advisors (including
Wells Fargo Securities and UBS) nor Parent, Parent’s representatives and affiliates (including EQT and the EQT Fund) makes any
representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of Lumos Networks or the surviving corporation compared to the
information contained in such financial projections and should not be read to do so.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to unduly
rely on the Management Projections included in this proxy statement.

Certain of the measures included in the Management Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as noted.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in
compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Lumos Networks may not be comparable to similarly titled
amounts used by other companies.

Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, you should be aware that certain of our
directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a
stockholder generally. The members of the Board voting on the Merger were aware of these interests in evaluating and negotiating the
Merger Agreement, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the
stockholders of Lumos Networks. See the sections entitled “—Background of the Merger” and “—Recommendation of Our Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on pages 35 and 46, respectively. You should take these interests into account in
deciding whether to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them, including the compensation that may become payable in
connection with the Merger to Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen, Anderson and Ferry and Ms. McDermott, who constitute our named
executive officers, which is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of Lumos Networks’ stockholders, are quantified in the narrative
below and under the heading “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation” beginning on
page 123. The dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily
reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.

Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards

Under the Merger Agreement, the equity-based awards held by Lumos Networks’ directors and executive officers will be treated as
follows:

Stock Options

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each option to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock (whether or not vested
and exercisable) that is then outstanding will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and
be cancelled and entitle the option holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock subject to the option and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable
exercise price per share of Lumos Networks Common Stock underlying

the option (less any applicable withholding taxes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of seven business days prior to the
closing of the Merger (and conditional on the closing), each holder of an outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Lumos
Networks will be entitled to exercise such option and shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock received upon such exercise will be
treated the same as other outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger.

The table below sets forth information regarding the Lumos Networks options held by each of our executive officers and directors as of
April 19, 2017 and the value of such options in the Merger.

Restricted Stock

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each share of Company restricted stock that is then outstanding will
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof become fully vested and restrictions thereon shall lapse and
entitle the holder of such Company restricted stock to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes and in
accordance with the same terms and conditions applied to holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock generally. Already vested shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock held by our non-employee directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as
outstanding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held by other Lumos Networks stockholders entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration.

Employment Arrangements with Lumos Networks

All of our executive officers, other than Mr. Ferry and Mr. Davis, are party to employment agreements. These employment agreements
provide that the base salary, Team Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the “TIP,” participation and certain other benefits would
continue throughout the term of the employment agreements, and the agreements also contain non-compete provisions, change of
control protection and severance arrangements. Specific terms of each employment agreement are as follows:
 

 

•  On May 5, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive
Officer, Mr. Biltz. The current term of the employment agreement is through April 30, 2018 and will automatically renew
for successive one-year periods thereafter unless notice of termination is previously provided. The employment agreement
provides for an annual base salary and a target bonus opportunity, which are currently set at $425,000 and 100% of
Mr. Biltz’s base salary. Pursuant to the management term sheet described below, Mr. Biltz and Parent will enter into an
amended and restated employment agreement in connection with the Merger.

 

 

•  In connection with his appointment as our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer we entered into an amended
and restated employment agreement with Mr. Broekhuysen, dated as of October 3, 2014, which was amended March 4,
2016. The current term of the employment agreement is through April 30, 2018 and will continue to automatically renew for
successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is previously provided. The employment agreement provides for an
annual base salary and target bonus opportunity, which are currently set at $310,648 and 70% of Mr. Broekhuysen’s base
salary.

Table of Contents

 

•  We entered into an employment agreement with our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Mr. Anderson on
August 28, 2012. The initial term of the employment agreement ended on December 31, 2013 after which time it has been
extended through automatic one-year renewals and will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year periods
unless notice of termination is previously provided. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary and
target bonus opportunity, which are currently set at $210,000 and 70% of Mr. Anderson’s base salary. In March 2016,
Mr. Anderson’s employment agreement was amended to provide that he would receive certain severance benefits in the
event the Company sells or otherwise divests its rural local exchange carrier operations and does not offer Mr. Anderson an
employment opportunity generally comparable in rank and benefits to his current position.

 

 

•  We entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our Senior Vice President and General Counsel,
Ms. McDermott on June 25, 2014. The initial term of the employment agreement ended on December 31, 2015 at which
time it will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is previously
provided. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary and a target bonus opportunity, which are currently
set at $226,324 and 70% of Ms. McDermott’s base salary.

 

 

•  Upon hiring Mr. Miller as our Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, we entered into an employment agreement
with him dated May 15, 2013. The initial term of the employment agreement ended on December 31, 2014 after which time
it has been extended through automatic one-year renewals and will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year
periods unless notice of termination is previously provided. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary
and a target bonus opportunity, which are currently set at $216,300 and 70% of Mr. Miller’s base salary.

 

 

•  Upon hiring Mr. McCourt as our Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, we entered into an employment
agreement with him dated as of May 29, 2012 (as amended and restated as of June 25, 2014). The initial term of the
employment agreement ended on December 31, 2015 after which time it has been extended through automatic one-year
renewals and will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is previously
provided. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary and a target bonus opportunity, which are currently
set at $216,000 and 70% of Mr. McCourt’s base salary.

The employment agreements we have with our executive officers provide our executive officers with change of control protection. A
“change of control” is defined in each of the executive officer’s employment agreements. The proposed Merger would constitute a
“change of control” under the employment agreements. If, following the proposed Merger, the executive officer is still employed by
Lumos Networks, the term of each employment agreement will be extended so that the term will not expire for at least 24 months from
the date of the change of control. If in connection with the change in control (or in the 24 months following the change of control), the
executive’s employment is terminated, the executive will receive severance payments for such termination as provided in the
employment agreement.

Each executive officer’s employment agreement with us provides for severance arrangements upon the occurrence of certain events.
Each executive officer’s employment agreement terminates automatically upon his or her death. In addition, we may terminate the
executive officer’s employment if he or she becomes disabled. The Company may also terminate the executive officer’s employment
for any other reason with or without cause (as defined in the employment agreement). The executive officer may terminate his or her
employment upon prior written notice of at least 60 days. If the executive officer terminates his or her employment for good reason (as
defined in the employment agreement), it will be deemed a termination of the executive officer’s employment without cause by Lumos
Networks.

If the executive officer’s employment with Lumos Networks is terminated for any reason, the executive officer is entitled under the
employment agreement to receive (i) earned and unpaid base salary to the date of termination; (ii) unreimbursed business and
entertainment expenses; and (iii) the employee benefits to which such executive is entitled pursuant to the applicable employee benefit
plans. If the executive officer’s employment with Lumos Networks is terminated upon the

Table of Contents

executive’s disability, the executive will be entitled to a pro-rata portion of such executive’s bonus payments from the TIP for the year
of termination. If the executive officer is terminated other than for cause or by reason of death or disability, or if the executive officer
terminates his or her employment with Lumos Networks for good reason, such executive officer is entitled to receive (i) earned but
unpaid bonus payments from the TIP; (ii) a percentage of his or her base salary (50% for Messrs. Broekhuysen, Anderson, McCourt
and Miller and 75% for Ms. McDermott) for a 12 month termination period, with the exception of Mr. Biltz, who would receive 50%
of his salary for a 24 month termination period; (iii) a lump sum, determined on a net present value basis, equal to the full bonus
potential under the TIP for the year of the termination (except with respect to Mr. Biltz who is entitled to receive 200% of his bonus
potential under the TIP for the year of termination); and (iv) continued participation in the employee medical and dental benefit plans
for the termination period. To the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
which we refer to as the “Code,” Lumos Networks will delay termination payments for a period of six months after termination or, if
earlier, until the executive officer’s death, as necessary to avoid any excise tax. After such delay expires, all payments which would
have otherwise been required to have been made during such delay period shall be paid to the executive officer in one lump sum
payment. Thereafter, the percentage of base salary payments will continue for the remainder of the termination period in such periodic
installments as were being paid immediately prior to the termination date.

Ms. McDermott and Mr. McCourt’s employment agreements also provide that if the executive is terminated other than for cause or the
executive officer terminates his or her employment with Lumos Networks for good reason in contemplation of or within one year
following a change in control, the termination period would extend to 24 months. Therefore, in such case, the base salary payment
described in (ii) in the paragraph above would extend for a 24 month period and the TIP bonus described in (iii) in the paragraph above
would be equal to 200% of the bonus potential under the TIP for the year of termination.

Mr. Anderson’s employment agreement also provides for certain vesting of options and restricted stock in the event the Company sells
or otherwise divests its rural local exchange carrier operations and does not offer Mr. Anderson an employment opportunity generally
comparable in rank and benefits to his current position. In connection with the Merger, the options and restricted stock held by the
executive officers immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger will automatically vest as provided in the Merger Agreement.

If any benefits payable or to be provided under the employment agreements and any other payments from Lumos Networks or any
affiliate would subject the executive officer to any excise taxes and penalties imposed on “parachute payments” within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, or any similar tax imposed by state or local law, then such payments or benefits will be reduced (but
not below $0) if, and only to the extent that, such reduction will allow the executive officer to receive a greater net after tax amount
than the executive officer would receive without such reduction.

As part of each executive officer’s employment agreement and as consideration for the termination payments described above, during
the executive officer’s employment with Lumos Networks and for a period of time thereafter (24 months for Mr. Biltz and 12 months
for Messrs. Broekhuysen, Anderson, Miller and McCourt and Ms. McDermott), which we refer to as the non-competition period, the
executive officer will not (i) compete, directly or indirectly, with Lumos Networks or Lumos Networks Operating Company or
(ii) solicit certain current and former employees. As consideration for the executive officer’s non-competition and non-solicitation
agreement, the executive officer will receive an amount equal to a percentage of such executive officer’s base salary (50% for Messrs.
Biltz, Broekhuysen, Anderson, McCourt and Miller and 25% for Ms. McDermott) during the non-competition period (or for 24
months, in the case of a termination in connection with or within one year following a change in control for Ms. McDermott and Mr.
McCourt), but only if Lumos Networks has terminated the executive officer without cause or if the executive officer has terminated his
or her employment for good reason. If the executive officer breaches any of the non-competition or non-solicitation restrictions, the
executive officer will not receive any further payments and the executive officer will repay any payments previously received. The
employment agreements also prohibit the executive officer from using any of confidential or proprietary information belonging to
Lumos Networks at any time for any reason not connected to their employment with Lumos Networks. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Ms. McDermott’s employment agreement is not intended to restrict her right to practice law following the termination of her
employment with Lumos Networks.

Severance Plan

Mr. Ferry and Mr. Davis are participants in the Lumos Networks Operating Company Severance Plan for Eligible Officers, which we
refer to as the “Severance Plan.” The Severance Plan provides for severance upon the occurrence of certain terminations of
employment. If the eligible officer’s employment with Lumos Networks is terminated without cause (as defined in the Severance Plan)
(other than by reason of the officer’s death or disability), the eligible officer is entitled to receive (i) the officer’s base salary for a
period of 12 months, less any sums required to be deducted or withheld under applicable law, (ii) subsidized rates for the continuation
of medical, dental and vision coverage for the officer and eligible dependents for a period of 12 months, (iii) with respect to certain
officers, including Mr. Ferry and Mr. Davis, a lump sum, determined on a net present value basis, equal to the full bonus potential

(v) earned and unpaid base salary to the date of termination, (vi) unreimbursed business and entertainment expenses and (vii) the
employee benefits to which he or she is entitled pursuant to the applicable employee benefit plans. If the officer is terminated for cause
or upon death or disability, or if the officer is otherwise ineligible under the Severance Plan, the officer is entitled to receive (i) earned
and unpaid base salary to the date of termination, (ii) unreimbursed business and entertainment expenses and (iii) any vested and
accrued employee benefits to which he or she is entitled pursuant to the applicable employee benefit plans.

Mr. Ferry and Mr. Davis are generally subject to the same non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions under the Severance Plan
that the other executive officers are subject to under their employment agreements, in addition to an indefinite non-disparagement
covenant, but Mr. Ferry and Mr. Davis do not receive any cash consideration for such restrictions in the event of a termination of
employment without cause or for good reason.

Management Term Sheet

In connection with the Merger, certain members of Lumos Networks management negotiated a management term sheet with Parent.
Pursuant to the management term sheet, Timothy G. Biltz will enter into an amended and restated employment agreement in
substantially the same form as in place on the date of the Merger Agreement with the following changes, among others:
 

 
•  his employment term will commence on the closing date of the Merger and continue through the fifth anniversary of the

closing date of the Merger; and
 

 
•  the existing provisions regarding stock-based incentive compensation will be replaced by the provisions included in the

management term sheet.

Mr. Biltz has also agreed to invest $2 million in common stock of Parent, which we refer to as the “CEO Direct Investment.” Pursuant
to the management term sheet, satisfaction of the investment amount may also be made, at Mr. Biltz’s election, by contributing existing
shares (but not stock options) which have vested prior to the closing date of the Merger. Other members of Lumos Networks
management will also be invited to participate in direct investments in amounts to be mutually agreed upon between such member and
EQT. Prior to the effective time of the Merger, Parent may initiate negotiations of these agreements and/or arrangements, and may enter
into definitive agreements regarding the right to participate in the common stock of Parent following the completion of the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a member of management may decide not to invest in the common stock of Parent or may invest more
or less than the amount previously specified in the common stock of Parent.

In connection with the closing of the Merger, pursuant to the management term sheet, Parent expects to adopt the “Parent Stock Option
Plan,” providing for additional grants of options to purchase approximately 9% of the fully-diluted shares of common stock of Parent.
Under this stock option plan, certain members of Lumos Networks management, which we refer to as “Grantees,” will be granted
nonqualified options to purchase common stock of Parent, which we refer to as the “Initial Options.” The number of Initial Options
granted to Mr. Biltz will represent, together with the CEO Direct Investment, 3% of the common stock of Parent (calculated on a fully
diluted basis immediately following the closing of the Merger). Subject to the officer’s continued employment with Lumos Networks
or its affiliates through the applicable vesting date, the Initial Options will vest as follows:
 

 
•  50% of the Initial Options will vest as to 20% of such options on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth

anniversaries of the closing of the Merger; and
 

 
•  the remaining 50% of the Initial Options will be eligible to vest based on specified performance goals of the EQT Fund

together with certain other co-investors.

As a condition of the grant of the Initial Options, each Grantee (other than Mr. Biltz or any other Grantee subject to an employment or
other effective agreement containing similar restrictive covenants) will be subject to certain non-competition provisions and
non-interference/non-solicitation/no-hire provisions and customary confidentiality, ownership of intellectual property and
non-disparagement provisions.

Table of Contents

Pursuant to the management term sheet, in connection with the issuance of common stock of Parent upon a direct investment and the
grant of the Initial Options, each Grantee will become a party to a management stockholders’ agreement which will provide, among
other rights and obligations, that (i) all shares of common stock of Parent acquired by an officer whether pursuant to a direct
investment, upon the exercise of stock options or otherwise will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer, (ii) each officer will have,
under certain circumstances, the right and/or obligation to participate in sales, purchases and registrations of the common stock of
Parent and (iii) Parent will have, under certain circumstances, repurchase rights in respect of the common stock of Parent held by each
manager.

Continuing Employees

The Merger Agreement provides that, for a period of one year following the effective time of the Merger, each employee of Lumos
Networks and any of its subsidiaries who, as of the closing, continues to be employed with Parent or any of its affiliates (including
Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries), who we refer to as a continuing employee, will receive (i) annual base compensation and a
target annual cash bonus opportunity at least equal to the base compensation and target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such
continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (ii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (iii) benefits,
perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment (excluding non-qualified retirement plans, deferred compensation
arrangements and equity-based compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits, perquisites and other terms
and conditions of employment provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

From and after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless, and will advance expenses as incurred to, each current and former director and officer of Lumos
Networks and its subsidiaries, which we refer to as “indemnitees,” against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or awards incurred in connection with any proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
Merger, including the fact that such indemnitee is or was a director or officer of Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries or any acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the effective time of the Merger, to the same extent any such indemnitee would have
been entitled to under Delaware law and under the organizational documents of Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries in effect on
of the date of the Merger Agreement. Any indemnitee receiving an advancement of expenses will be required to provide, as a condition
to such advancement, an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification.

For a period of six years from the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will assume, and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to assume, the obligations of Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries with respect to rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger existing in
favor of indemnitees as provided in the organizational documents of Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries or in any
indemnification contract between an indemnitee and Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date of
the Merger Agreement.

For six years from the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will maintain, and Parent will cause the surviving
corporation to maintain, provisions of the surviving corporation’s organizational documents with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors and indemnification and advancement of expenses of officers and directors of the Company that are no less favorable to the
indemnitees than were set forth in the organizational documents of Lumos Networks as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.
During that period, the surviving corporation will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of any indemnitee. If any actual or threatened claim is made during that period, all indemnification rights
related to that claim will continue until the disposition or resolution of such the action, suit, proceeding or investigation in accordance
with the surviving corporation’s organizational documents.

Table of Contents

Prior to the effective time of the Merger, Lumos Networks will or, will cause the surviving corporation as of the effective time of the
Merger to, obtain and pay for a six-year non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of Lumos
Networks’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, which we refer to as
“D&O insurance,” with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the effective time of the Merger. The extension
of the D&O insurance, or “tail,” is required to be obtained from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Lumos
Networks’ current insurance carrier with respect to D&O insurance and is required to have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under Lumos Networks’ existing D&O insurance
policies. If Lumos Networks and the surviving corporation do not obtain such D&O insurance on or prior to the effective time of the
Merger, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of
at least six years from and after the effective time of the Merger, the D&O insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement
with Lumos Networks’ current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating and with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under Lumos
Networks’ existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Alternatively, the surviving corporation will purchase from Lumos
Networks’ current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating comparable D&O insurance for
such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than as provided
in Lumos Networks’ existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, but under no circumstance will Lumos Networks pay, or
will Parent or the surviving corporation be required to pay, a one-time premium in connection with the “tail” policy in excess of 300%
of the amount per year that Lumos Networks paid in its last full fiscal year or annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per
year that Lumos Networks paid in its last full fiscal year. If the aggregate premiums of the D&O insurance required to be maintained
exceed these limits, then Lumos Networks or the surviving corporation will only be required to obtain a D&O insurance policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such limits.

Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation

The table below provides information about certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger. The amounts in the table were calculated using outstanding option and restricted stock holdings as of
April 19, 2017 and a per-share price for Lumos Networks Common Stock of $18.00, which is the Merger Consideration, and assumes
the Merger closed on April 19, 2017. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below is subject to a non-binding,
advisory vote of Lumos Networks’ stockholders, as described below in “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named
Executive Officer Compensation” beginning on page 123.

The amounts in the table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur, including assumptions described in
this proxy statement, and do not include amounts that were vested as of April 19, 2017 (the latest practicable date prior to the filing of
this proxy statement). In addition, certain amounts will vary depending on the actual date of closing of the Merger, which is presently
expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed that each named executive officer’s
employment is terminated on April 19, 2017 by the Company without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason, as
those terms are defined in the named executive officer’s employment agreement with us, even though none of the named executive
officers is currently expected to incur a termination of employment in connection with the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if
any, to be received by an applicable individual may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

(1) The amounts in this column represent cash severance payments that each named executive officer would be entitled to receive
under his employment agreement or the Severance Plan if the named executive officer’s employment were terminated by the
Company without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason on April 19, 2017. These payments are payable in the
event of such an employment termination, regardless of whether the Merger occurs. Refer to “Interests of the Directors and
Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger—Employment Arrangements with Lumos Networks” and “—Severance
Plan” beginning on pages 66 and 68, respectively, of this proxy statement for a description of each named executive officer’s
severance rights under the employment agreements and the Severance Plan.

The following table provides additional details of the named executive officers’ potential cash severance payments.

(2) The amounts in this column represent the aggregate merger consideration that each named executive officer would receive with

respect to Company equity-based awards subject to cancellation or accelerated vesting, as applicable, in connection with the
Merger, as described above in “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger—Treatment of
Equity and Equity-Based Awards” beginning on page 64. These are “single trigger” arrangements. The following table quantifies
the value of the unvested options and restricted stock held by the named executive officers. The value of an unvested option has
been calculated by multiplying (i) the excess of the $18.00 Merger Consideration over the applicable per-share exercise price of
the unvested option by (ii) the number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock subject to the unvested option. The value of
restricted stock has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares of restricted stock by the $18.00 Merger Consideration.

Networks in the Merger” beginning on page 64.

Financing of the Merger

Parent estimates that the total amount required to complete the Merger and the related transactions and to pay related fees and expenses
will be approximately $1,003 million. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following:
 

 

•  Debt Financing. Debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $485 million of senior secured first lien term loans as
well as a committed $50 million senior secured revolving facility, a portion of which will be available at the closing of the
Merger. Parent has received firm commitments from a consortium of financial institutions to provide the debt financing and
revolving credit facility. See the section entitled “—Debt Financing” below; and

 

 
•  Equity Financing. Equity financing to be provided by the EQT Fund, in an aggregate amount of up to $517.9 million to be

funded at the closing of the Merger. See the section entitled “—Equity Financing” below.

The consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition (although the funding of the equity financing and the debt
financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the applicable commitment letter under which such financing will
be provided).

Debt Financing

In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Parent has obtained a commitment letter, which we refer to as the “debt
commitment letter,” from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, which we refer to collectively as the
“debt commitment parties,” to provide, severally but not jointly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt
commitment letter, in the aggregate, up to $535 million in debt financing, consisting of the following:
 

 •  a $485 million senior secured first lien term loan facility; and
 

 
•  a $50 million senior secured first lien revolving credit facility. In the event additional revolving commitments are obtained

prior to the closing of the Merger, the amount of the revolving credit facility may be increased to up to $75 million.

The proceeds of the debt financing will be used (i) to finance, in part, the payment of the amounts payable under the Merger
Agreement, (ii) to repay certain existing indebtedness of the Company and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

Table of Contents

The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter are subject to a number
of customary conditions, including (i) since February 18, 2017 no company material adverse effect (as defined in the section entitled
“Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties” beginning on page 90) with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole shall have occurred, (ii) the consummation, prior to or substantially simultaneous with, the initial borrowing under the debt
facilities, of the Merger in all material respects in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment,
waiver, consent or other modification to the Merger Agreement that is materially adverse to the debt commitment parties and the other
lenders), (iii) the consummation of the equity financing, prior to, or substantially simultaneously with, the initial borrowings under the
debt facilities, (iv) the consummation of the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of the Company, prior to, or substantially
simultaneously with, the initial borrowings under the debt facilities, (v) the receipt of certain audited, unaudited and pro forma
financial statements, (vi) the lenders having been afforded a marketing period of at least 15 consecutive business days (subject to
certain customary blackout dates) following receipt of the financial statements described in clause (v) above, (vii) subject to customary
“SunGard conditionality” provisions, execution and delivery of guarantees by certain guarantors and the taking of certain actions
necessary to establish and perfect a security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to certain
exceptions), (viii) the accuracy in all material respects of specified representations and warranties in the loan documents under which
the debt financing will be provided and of certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, (ix) the receipt of
documentation and other information about the borrowers and guarantors required under applicable “know your customer” and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations (including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October
26, 2001))), (x) the consummation of the debt financing under the debt commitment letter on or before November 24, 2017,
(xi) delivery of certain customary closing documents and (xii) payment of applicable fees and expenses.

The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter will terminate at the
earliest of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement without the consummation of the Merger having occurred, (ii) the completion of
the Merger with or without the funding of the applicable debt financing or (iii) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on November 24, 2017
if the closing shall not have occurred on or prior to such time and date.

Equity Financing

Parent has received a commitment letter, which we refer to as the “equity commitment letter,” from the EQT Fund pursuant to which
the EQT Fund has committed, subject to the conditions of the equity commitment letter, to provide equity financing in an aggregate
amount of up to $517.9 million, or such lesser amount as may be required by Parent to complete the Merger and the related
transactions as set forth in the Merger Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and to pay related fees and
expenses.

Funding of the equity financing is subject to the conditions provided in the equity commitment letter, which include: (i) the satisfaction
or waiver, on or before the closing of the Merger, of all of the conditions precedent to Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to
consummate the Merger, (ii) the prior or substantially concurrent receipt by Parent of the proceeds of the debt financing and (iii) Parent
being obligated to effect the consummation of the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The equity commitment letter and the EQT Fund’s obligation to fund all or any portion of the equity financing will terminate
automatically and immediately on the first to occur of (i) the assertion, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its affiliates of
any claim against the EQT Fund, Parent, Merger Sub or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, controlling person, equityholder, incorporator, affiliate or representative of the EQT Fund, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective successors, predecessors or assigns, or any former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, controlling person, equityholder, incorporator, affiliate or representative of any of
the foregoing or any of their respective successors, predecessors or assigns (in each case other than the EQT Fund, Parent or Merger
Sub in accordance with the terms and conditions of the equity commitment letter), relating to the equity commitment letter, the
termination equity commitment letter (as described under “—Termination Equity Commitment Letter” below), the Merger Agreement,
the debt commitment letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than any claim by the Company (x) against

letter and (z) against the EQT Fund under this letter in accordance with, and solely to the extent permitted under the equity
commitment letter and the Merger Agreement, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (iii) the
effective time of the Merger and (iv) payment of the parent termination fee in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Upon the valid termination of the equity commitment letter, EQT Fund will not have any further obligations or liabilities under the
equity commitment letter.

The Company is an express third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter for the purpose of, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, seeking specific performance of the EQT Fund’s obligation to fund the equity commitment to
Parent (see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Specific Performance” beginning on page 118).

Termination Equity Commitment Letter

Parent has received a commitment letter, which we refer to as the “termination equity commitment letter,” from the EQT Fund pursuant
to which the EQT Fund has committed to provide funds to Parent for the purpose of paying the parent termination fee if the Merger
Agreement is terminated by the Company under certain specified circumstances (see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fees” beginning on page 114).

The obligation of the EQT Fund under the termination equity commitment letter with respect to the parent termination fee is subject to
an aggregate cap equal to the amount of $32.1 million, plus certain costs and expenses of enforcement, if applicable.

The termination equity commitment letter and the EQT Fund’s obligation to fund the parent termination fee will terminate on the first
to occur of (i) the effective time of the Merger, (ii) payment in full of all amounts payable pursuant to the termination equity
commitment letter, (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement under circumstances in which Parent is not required to pay the parent
termination fee and (iv) the three-month anniversary of the termination of the Merger Agreement under circumstances in which Parent
is required to pay the parent termination fee, except as to this clause (iv) as to any notice of a claim for payment of the amounts payable
pursuant to the termination equity commitment letter presented in writing by the Company to Parent or the EQT Fund on or prior to
such three-month anniversary (in which case, the date of termination of this termination equity commitment letter shall be extended
while such claim is resolved).

The Company’s recourse through Parent against the EQT Fund under the termination equity commitment letter (subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the termination equity commitment letter) is the sole and exclusive remedy against the EQT Fund and any
related persons of the EQT Fund (and any related person of such related persons, except, in each case, for Parent and Merger Sub), and
neither the EQT Fund nor any related person of the EQT Fund (nor any related person of such related persons, except, in each case, for
Parent and Merger Sub), will have any liability or obligations to any person, in each case, in respect of any losses or damages suffered
as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated, for any
breach or failure to perform under the Merger Agreement, or otherwise relating to or arising out of the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereunder, except for claims by the Company seeking an injunction or specific performance of the EQT
Fund’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded, solely pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the equity
commitment letter and the Merger Agreement.

The Company is an express third party beneficiary of the termination equity commitment letter for the purpose of, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, seeking specific performance of the EQT Fund’s obligation to fund the parent
termination fee to Parent.

Appraisal Rights

General

If the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and who properly demand an appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory
procedures in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with the statutory requirements will result in
the loss of your appraisal rights.

This section summarizes certain material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however,
is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of
Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references in
Section 262 of the DGCL to “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. The following
discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Lumos
Networks stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Under the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, you do not wish to accept the Merger
Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement, you do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and you
otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to have your shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) in cash, together with interest, if any,
to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the $18.00 Merger Consideration which Lumos Networks stockholders
will be entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as
appraisal rights.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the Lumos Networks annual meeting at which the adoption of the
Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, Lumos Networks must notify each stockholder who was a Lumos Networks
stockholder on the record date for notice of such meeting and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are
available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes the required notice, and a
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement.

A HOLDER OF LUMOS NETWORKS COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO
WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS AND APPENDIX B
CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO COMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY
AND PROPER MANNER WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE
PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF
LUMOS NETWORKS COMMON STOCK WHO IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH HIS, HER OR ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY SHARES OF LUMOS
NETWORKS COMMON STOCK HELD BY A LUMOS NETWORKS STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT,
SUCCESSFULLY WITHDRAWS OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION.

How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights

If you are a Lumos Networks stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock, you must comply with ALL of the following:
 

 

•  you must not vote “FOR,” or otherwise consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Because a proxy that
is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must include
voting instructions to vote your share “AGAINST,” or as an abstention with respect to, the adoption of the Merger
Agreement;

Table of Contents

 
•  you must continuously hold your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock from the date of making the demand through

the effective time of the Merger. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock before the effective time of the Merger;

 

 
•  prior to the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting, you must deliver a proper written

demand for appraisal of your shares; and
 

 

•  you, another stockholder, an appropriate beneficial owner or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock within 120
days after the effective time of the Merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any such petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of Lumos Networks
stockholders to initiate all necessary action to properly demand their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Filing a Written Demand

Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the merger proposal, will
in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Lumos Networks, before the taking of the vote
on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the annual meeting (at which the merger proposal will be submitted to the stockholders), a
written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written demand prior to the taking of
the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the annual meeting of stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may demand appraisal
rights for the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by
or on behalf of the holder of record. The demand should specify the stockholder’s name and mailing address and the number of shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock registered in the stockholder’s name and must state that the person intends thereby to demand
appraisal of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the Merger. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Lumos
Networks of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of the “fair value” of his, her or its
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock of
record may not directly make appraisal demands to Lumos Networks. The beneficial owner must, in such cases, arrange for the holder
of record, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock as
a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held
for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. The written demand should state the
number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held in
the name of the holder of record.

IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF LUMOS NETWORKS COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR
OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR
BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM
OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST IN SHARES OF LUMOS NETWORKS COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER
PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF
RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF LUMOS NETWORKS COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK OR
BROKERAGE WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES

Table of Contents

DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH
SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE
DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.

If your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, execution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are owned of record jointly with
one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and
all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for
a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in
exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of record. If you hold shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock through a nominee or intermediary who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee, a
demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee
as record holder. Stockholders who hold their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee
forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.

If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:

Lumos Networks Corp.
One Lumos Plaza

Waynesboro, VA 22980
(540) 946-2000

At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger, any Lumos Networks stockholder that made a demand for appraisal
but has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw the
demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal, but after such 60-day
period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the surviving corporation.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation. Within ten days after the effective date of the Merger, the Company, as the surviving corporation,
must notify each holder of Lumos Networks Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, of the date that the Merger has become effective.

Filing a Petition For Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, but not
later, either you, provided you have complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights, or the surviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock held by all stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. None of EQT, the EQT Fund,
Parent, Merger Sub or Lumos Networks, as the surviving corporation, is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any
intention to do so. If you desire to have your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock appraised, you should initiate any petitions
necessary for properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the
DGCL.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL,
you will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which
Lumos Networks has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The surviving corporation
must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the request therefor or (ii) 10
days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal
petition or request from the surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph. If a petition for appraisal is not timely
filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.

Table of Contents

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of Lumos Networks Common Stock who has properly
exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is
delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy
of the petition, to file with the Delaware Court of Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who
have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock have not been reached by the surviving corporation. After notice to the stockholders as
required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine which Lumos
Networks stockholders have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have become entitled to appraisal rights and may require the
Lumos Networks stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock to submit their
stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court
of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any Lumos Networks stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. In addition,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock exceeds $1 million.

The appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock owned by such stockholders, in
accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock at the effective time of the Merger held by all Lumos Networks stockholders who have properly demanded their
appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the effective
time of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the
Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as
provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the Lumos
Networks stockholders entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by
certificated stockholders to the surviving corporation of their stock certificates.

In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial
community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair
value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
factors which were known or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the
merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such
exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative
elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court

construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” An opinion of an investment
banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to fair value
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock as determined under Section 262 of the
DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Neither EQT, the EQT Fund, Parent,
Merger Sub or Lumos Networks, as the surviving corporation, anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Lumos
Networks stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of
Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Lumos Networks Common Stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.

If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, then you will lose the right to an
appraisal, and will instead receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less
any withholding taxes.

The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees
and expenses of experts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred
by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence
of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.

If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL, you will not, from and after the effective time of
the Merger, be entitled to vote the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any
dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Lumos
Networks Common Stock as of a record date prior to the effective time of the Merger.

If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw a demand for
appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the
consideration payable in the Merger to the surviving corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the
effective time of the Merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval
may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision will not affect the
right of any Lumos Networks stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the
Merger within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your demand for
appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock will be deemed to have been
converted as of the effective time of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any
withholding taxes.

Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE
TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS,
YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES
BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.

Accounting Treatment

The Merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following general discussion sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders and
non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) who receive cash in exchange for shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
consequences of the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder and court and
administrative rulings and decisions, all as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing
interpretations, and any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively, and any such change could affect the
accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. There can be no assurance the Internal Revenue Service, which
we refer to as the “IRS,” or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the
Merger. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, or
under any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws. This discussion also does not
address any tax consequences under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to Section 1411 of the Code.

This discussion is limited to holders of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock who hold such shares as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion
does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation:
 

 •  U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 

 •  persons holding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that are subject to the alternative minimum tax;
 

 •  U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  persons holding shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as

part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;
 

 •  banks, thrifts, and other financial institutions;
 

 •  insurance companies;
 

 •  brokers or dealers in stocks and securities, or currencies;
 

 •  traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;
 

 
•  controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid

U.S. federal income tax;
 

 
•  S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes

or other pass-through entities (and investors therein);
 

 •  real estate investment trusts, mutual funds and regulated investment companies;
 

 •  tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;

Table of Contents

 •  persons deemed to sell their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
 

 •  persons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the surviving corporation;
 

 
•  persons who hold or received their shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee

stock option, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation;
 

 •  retirement plans, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts; and
 

 
•  holders of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock who exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the

DGCL.

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on
the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If a holder is a partner in a partnership holding Lumos Networks Common
Stock, the holder should consult its tax advisors.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders

Definition of a U.S. Holder

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes is or is treated as:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation (or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the

laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more “United States persons” (within the

meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid
election in effect to be treated as a “United States person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Effect of the Merger

The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger generally will equal the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for
such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share generally will be equal
to the amount the U.S. holder paid for the share. Gain or loss and holding period will be determined separately for each block of shares
of Lumos Networks Common Stock (that is, shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a
share of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the U.S. holder has held such share for more than one year at the effective time of Merger. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-
term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally
taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to
information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do
not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in
the letter of transmittal, certifying that such holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and that
such holder is not subject to backup withholding. Certain holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup withholding or
information reporting rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or
a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the
procedures for obtaining such an exemption.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders

Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder

For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that is neither
a U.S. holder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Effect of the Merger

A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger unless:
 

 
•  the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if

required by an applicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the
non-U.S. holder in the United States);

 

 
•  the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable

year of the disposition of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in the Merger, and certain other requirements are met;
or

 

 

•  Lumos Networks is or has been treated as a United States real property holding corporation, which we refer to as
“USRPHC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of
the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock and the non-U.S. holder
held (actually or constructively) more than five percent of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock at any time during
such five-year period.

Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular
graduated U.S. federal income tax rates, generally in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S.
holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or lower rate specified in an applicable income
treaty, on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.

Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate
as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder
(even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S.
federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

With respect to the third bullet point above, the determination of whether Lumos Networks is a USRPHC depends on the fair market
value of its United States real property interests relative to the fair market value of its other trade or business assets and its United
States and foreign real property interests. Lumos Networks believes it has not been a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes
during the time described above.

Table of Contents

Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different
rules.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made to non-U.S. holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Non-U.S. holders
generally can avoid backup withholding and information reporting by providing the paying agent with the applicable and properly
executed IRS Form W-8 certifying the holder’s non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information
returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax
authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder is resident for tax purposes. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

The foregoing discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to constitute a complete description of all tax
consequences relating to the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger to a Lumos Networks stockholder will depend upon
the facts of the stockholder’s particular situation. Because individual circumstances may differ, Lumos Networks stockholders
are urged to consult with their own tax advisor regarding the applicability of the rules discussed above and the particular tax
effects of the Merger, including the application of state, local, non-U.S. and non-income tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

General

Lumos Networks and Parent have generally agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification
requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. These approvals include the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory
clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will
not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or
require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the Merger cannot be completed until Lumos Networks and
Parent each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period
thereunder has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a
30 calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of
that waiting period. Lumos Networks and Parent and its affiliates filed their respective HSR Act premerger notifications on March 3,
2017 with the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act and the HSR waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. on April 3, 2017.

At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring
the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the
completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could
take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to
enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal
action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

Federal Communications Commission Approval

Lumos Networks is subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. Lumos Networks holds a number of FCC
authorizations related to the provision of regulated services. FCC approval is required before Lumos Networks may transfer control of
its authorizations to Parent. The FCC will not issue its approval until it receives the consent of the Team Telecom executive branch
government agencies that undertake a national security review of certain applications filed with the FCC involving potential foreign
ownership of U.S. telecommunications assets. In determining whether to approve the proposed change of control of Lumos Networks,
the FCC considers whether such change in ownership serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity. As part of this process, the
FCC examines whether a proposed change in ownership is consistent with the policies of the Communications Act, including, among
other things, the effect of the proposed transfer on the “public interest” and the FCC’s policies encouraging competition.

Parent and Lumos Networks filed with the FCC applications requesting the FCC’s consent to the change in ownership of Lumos
Networks on March 2, 2017. As part of its review process, the FCC will refer the application to Team Telecom. In turn, as part of the
Team Telecom process, Lumos Networks expects to enter into an agreement with these agencies to address certain national security,
law enforcement, and public safety concerns related to Lumos Networks’ operations. The FCC may condition its approval on the
parties’ compliance with the terms of the anticipated agreement.

CFIUS Approval

The Merger Agreement provides for the parties to file a voluntary notice under the DPA with CFIUS, an intergovernmental agency that
undertakes national security reviews and, where appropriate, investigations in transactions where a foreign company acquires control of
a U.S. company. CFIUS conducts an initial 30-day review of transactions of which it is notified, and may, at the end of the initial
30-day review period, conduct an additional investigation that must be completed within 45 days. The parties to a notified transaction
may, with the consent of CFIUS and mutual agreement, withdraw and re-file a CFIUS notice, thereby commencing a new 30-day
review period (and, if necessary, 45-day investigation). In certain situations, at the conclusion of an investigation, a report may be sent
to the President, who then has 15 days to decide whether to block the transaction or to take other action.

CFIUS considers many factors in determining whether a proposed transaction threatens to impair national security, including domestic
production needed for national defense requirements, the capability of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements, and
the potential effects on U.S. international technological leadership in areas affecting national security.

CFIUS reviews also provide an opportunity for U.S. federal government agencies to ensure compliance with various regulations
relating to national security, such as the requirement to obtain export licenses for exports of controlled technical data. The parties are
required to submit information about classified and other defense-related contracts of the acquired company.

Parent and Lumos Networks believe that, with the proposed foreign ownership, control or influence and other mitigation measures, the
Merger will not give rise to national security concerns that would cause the transaction to be blocked.

State

Lumos Networks also holds state telecommunications certificates and licenses that require approval before control of Lumos Networks
can be transferred to Parent. In addition, some state laws require approval for licensees to enter into certain financing arrangements.
Lumos Networks and Parent have made all of the initial required filings with the appropriate state public utility commissions.

Timing of Regulatory Approvals

We currently anticipate that all regulatory approvals will be received by the third quarter of 2017, although the receipt of approvals and
their timing cannot be assured or predicted at this time.

Litigation Related to the Merger

On April 4, 2017 and April 11, 2017, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware against Lumos Networks’ directors, EQT Partners Inc., Parent and Merger Sub. The plaintiffs in the actions allege that the
preliminary proxy statement filed by Lumos Networks with the SEC on March 31, 2017 contained false and misleading statements and
omitted material information in violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and
further that the individual defendants, EQT Partners Inc., Parent and Merger Sub are liable for those alleged misstatements and
omissions under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the Merger or, if the Merger has
been consummated, to rescind the Merger or an award of damages, and an award of attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs. Although it
is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation matters with certainty, Lumos Networks believes that the claims raised in the actions
are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary is not complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety because

have the right not to close the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a
change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement;

 

 
•  have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made among the parties to the Merger

Agreement in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger
Agreement itself;

Table of Contents

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Lumos Networks, with Lumos Networks continuing as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent from and after the effective time of the Merger.

At the effective time of the Merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will consist of the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the effective time, until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable law. From and after the effective time of the Merger, the officers of Lumos Networks at the effective time of the Merger will
be the officers of the surviving corporation, until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with applicable law. At the effective time of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of Lumos Networks as the
surviving corporation will be amended, without any further action on the part of Lumos Networks or any other person, to be identical
to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except that the name of
the Company shall be the name of the surviving corporation, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub relating to
the incorporator of Merger Sub will be omitted and the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and indemnification and advancement of expenses of officers and directors of the Company will be
revised to be no less favorable to current or former directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, whom we collectively
refer to the Company indemnified persons, than the provisions set forth in the current certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company described further below under “—Director’s and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 104. At the
effective time of the Merger, the bylaws of the Company will be amended to be identical to the current bylaws of Merger Sub, except
that the name of the surviving corporation will be changed to the name of the Company.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger; Marketing Period

Unless another date is agreed by the parties, the closing of the Merger will take place at the offices of Troutman Sanders LLP, 1001
Haxall Point, Richmond, VA 23219, on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions to
closing (described below under “—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 111) (other than those conditions to be
satisfied at the closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). However, if the marketing period (as summarized
below) has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of such closing conditions, the closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a
date during the marketing period specified by Parent on no fewer than two business days’ notice to Lumos Networks and (ii) the
second business day following the end of the marketing period, subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
closing as of such date.

Concurrently with the closing, or on a different date as the parties may agree, Merger Sub or Lumos Networks will file a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon the
filing of the certificate of Merger, or at such later time as is agreed by Parent and Lumos Networks and specified in the certificate of
Merger.

The “marketing period” refers to the first period of 17 consecutive business days throughout which (a) Parent and its debt financing
sources have certain financial information to the extent required by the debt commitment letter, which information we refer to as the
“financing information,” and (b) the closing conditions to the obligations of each party and the closing conditions to the obligations of
only Parent and Merger Sub (described below under “—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 111) are satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to such conditions being
satisfied assuming the closing would occur) and nothing shall have occurred and no condition shall exist that would cause any of those
closing conditions to fail to be satisfied during such period. In addition, the following provisos apply in respect of the marketing
period: (i) July 3, 2017 shall not constitute a business day for purposes of such 17 consecutive business day period; (ii) if such 17
consecutive business day period has not ended on or prior to August 18, 2017, then such period shall not start until September 5, 2017;

historical financial statements included in the financing information or that any such restatement is under consideration, then the
marketing period will not be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, such restatement has been completed and the
applicable financing information has been amended and delivered to Parent and its debt financing sources or the Company has
announced that it has concluded that no restatement shall be required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP; and (v) if Lumos Networks in good faith reasonably believes that the marketing period has commenced and that it has provided
the financing information, Lumos Networks may deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect, in which case Lumos Networks will
be deemed to have complied with clause (a) unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes that either the marketing period has not
commenced or that Lumos Networks has not completed the delivery of the financing information, and, within three business days after
the delivery of such notice by Lumos Networks, Parent delivers a written notice to Lumos Networks to that effect.

Merger Consideration

Common Stock

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Lumos Networks Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such
time (other than (i) shares held by Lumos Networks as treasury stock or shares, held by Parent (which shares shall be canceled and no
Merger consideration shall be paid with respect thereto) or shares held by any subsidiary of the Company, which shares shall remain
outstanding and no Merger consideration shall be paid with respect thereto and (ii) shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held by
stockholders who have not voted in favor of the Merger and who have properly exercised and not withdrawn appraisal rights under
Delaware law with respect to such shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.00 per share in cash, which
amount we refer to as the “Merger Consideration,” without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. All shares of Lumos
Networks Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be cancelled at the effective
time of the Merger, and each certificate formerly representing such shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock will thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Outstanding Equity Awards and Other Awards

The Merger Agreement provides for the following treatment with respect to equity awards relating to Lumos Networks Common
Stock:

Stock Options

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each option to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock (whether vested or
unvested) that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, vest and be cancelled and entitle the option holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock subject to the option and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per share of Lumos Networks Common Stock underlying the option (less any
applicable withholding taxes). If the exercise price of any option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such option will be
cancelled without the payment of any consideration to the holder. At or as soon as practicable after the effective time of the Merger, the
surviving corporation will make the option payments, if any, due to each holder of such Lumos Networks options pursuant to the
Company’s ordinary payroll practices.

Restricted Stock

Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each share of Company restricted stock, that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof vest
and entitle the holder of such share of Company restricted stock to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding
taxes and in accordance with the same terms and conditions applied to holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock generally. At or as
soon as practicable after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will make the restricted stock payments, if any, due
to each holder of such Lumos Networks restricted stock pursuant to the Company’s ordinary payroll practices.

Table of Contents

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Each right to purchase Lumos Networks Common Stock under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as a
“Company Purchase Right,” that was outstanding as of February 18, 2017 and remains outstanding will automatically be exercised on
the purchase date specified with respect to that Company Purchase Right under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
related award agreement. If the purchase date is on or before the effective time of the Merger, the holder of that Company Purchase
Right will receive shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and if the purchase date is after the effective time of the Merger, the holder of that Company Purchase Right will receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock that
would have otherwise been delivered with respect to that Company Purchase Right.

Termination of the 2011 Company Equity and Cash Incentive Plan and the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan

As of the effective time of the Merger, the 2011 Company Equity and Cash Incentive Plan and the Company Employee Stock Purchase
Plan will be terminated and no further Company restricted shares, options or other rights with respect to shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock will be granted thereunder.

Dissenting Shares

Any shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the merger proposal or consented
thereto in writing and who have properly demanded appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and at the effective
time all such dissenting shares shall be cancelled and the holders of such dissenting shares will only be entitled to the rights granted to
them under Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until any such stockholder fails to perfect or, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
such stockholder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL or other applicable law. If any holder of dissenting shares fails to perfect,
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights, then the dissenting shares will be deemed to have been
converted, as of the effective time of the Merger, into, and will be exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Under the Merger Agreement, Lumos Networks must give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of any
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL relating to rights to be paid the fair value of dissenting shares
and Parent has the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the effective
time, Lumos Networks may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or commitment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands, or waive any failure to perfect any right to appraisal or to timely take any other action to
perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

Surrender and Payment

At or prior to the effective time of the Merger, Parent will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to Lumos Networks, which
institution we refer to as the “Exchange Agent,” to make payments of the Merger Consideration to stockholders. At or immediately
following the effective time of the Merger, Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration to stockholders (except with respect to dissenting shares and cancelled shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock) with the Exchange Agent, provided that Parent will not be required to make available any Merger Consideration to the extent
the Company has made available amounts from its cash on hand.

Table of Contents

As soon as practicable (but no later than the third business day) after the effective time of the Merger, Parent will send, or will cause
the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock a letter of transmittal together with
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
certificates or transfer of the uncertificated shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such share of Lumos Networks Common Stock represented by a certificate and each uncertificated share of
Lumos Networks Common Stock shall represent after the effective time of the Merger for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, representing such share or (ii) in the case of a book-entry transfer of an uncertificated share, receipt of an “agent’s
message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in respect
of the share of Lumos Networks Common Stock represented by thereby. The amount of any Merger Consideration paid to the
stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the certificates.

If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate for
shares or the transferred uncertificated shares is registered, then it will be a condition to such payment that (i) either such certificate is
properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form for transfer or such uncertificated shares shall be properly transferred and (ii) the
person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a
person other than the registered holder of such certificate or uncertificated shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

If any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent remains undistributed to holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock nine months
following the effective time of the Merger, such cash (including any interest or other income received in respect thereto) will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock who have not complied with the exchange
procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. Any Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the holders of Lumos Networks Common Stock four years after the
effective time of the Merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date or which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to,
or become property of, any governmental entity) will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claim or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

If any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such stock certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (and if required by the surviving corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the surviving corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such stock certificate), the surviving corporation or the Exchange Agent will, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.

claim a refund of material taxes; or

 

 •  authorize or enter into any agreement or arrangement to do any of the foregoing.

The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, from the date of the Merger
Agreement to the effective time of the Merger, take any action or fail to take any action that is intended to, or would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the financing thereof.

Access to Information

The Merger Agreement provides that, until the effective time of the Merger and subject to applicable law and the confidentiality
agreement, dated June 17, 2016, between Parent and the EQT Fund, which we refer to as the “Confidentiality Agreement,” the
Company shall:
 

 
•  give Parent, its counsel, Financial Advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives, upon reasonable notice,

reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries;

 

 
•  furnish to Parent, its counsel, Financial Advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating

data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request;
 

 
•  furnish to Parent monthly financial, operating and Board reports generally prepared by the Company on a regular basis

promptly after such reports are delivered to the other recipients thereof; and
 

 
•  instruct its employees, counsel, Financial Advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate reasonably

with Parent in its investigation of the Company and its subsidiaries.

The Merger Agreement requires Parent to conduct any investigation in a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Additionally, without the Company’s prior written consent, Parent and its
representatives are prohibited from performing any invasive or destructive environmental sampling at any owned or leased real
property of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Merger Agreement also requires Parent and the Company to hold, and cause their
respective representatives to hold, all information received from the other party as confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation

Subject to certain exceptions, until the earlier to occur of the effective time of the Merger and the termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with its terms, the Company will generally not be permitted to solicit or discuss alternative proposals with third parties,
as described below. For purposes of the Merger Agreement:
 

 

•  “acceptable confidentiality agreement” means a confidentiality agreement (i) in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement
or (ii) that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and which does not prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations under the Merger
Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement does not need to restrict a third party from making directly to the
Company or the Board, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, an acquisition proposal;

 

 
•  “acquisition proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, any offer, proposal or

inquiry relating to (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of more than 20% of the consolidated assets, revenues
or income of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or more than

Table of Contents

 

20% of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, revenue or income,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets, revenues or income of the Company,
(ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a third party
beneficially owning more than 20% of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
whose assets, revenue or income, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets,
revenues or income of the Company or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of
substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, revenue or income, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than
20% of the consolidated assets, revenue or income of the Company; and

 

 

•  “superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal (except the references therein to “20%” shall be
replaced by “50%”) that was not solicited or received by the Company in violation of the Merger Agreement, that is
reasonably likely to be consummated and that the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, considering such factors as the Board considers appropriate (which shall in any event
include financial, legal, regulatory and fiduciary aspects of such proposal) and the person making such proposal or providing
financing for such proposal to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any offer by Parent to modify the terms of the Merger
Agreement).

Until the earlier to occur of the effective time of the Merger and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company and its subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’
respective representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any persons that may
be ongoing with respect to an acquisition proposal from any third party (except to notify that person as to the existence of the
non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement), and to not:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate, or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal or any

inquiry, offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, or could
reasonably be expected to make any acquisition proposal; or

 

 
•  enter into any letter of intent or other agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal (except for an acceptable

confidentiality agreement) with any third party.

The Merger Agreement specifically allows the Company to waive in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement any
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party that prohibits the counterparty from
confidentially requesting the Company to amend or waive the standstill provision in such agreement (i.e., a “don’t ask to waive”
provision) to the extent the Board determines that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Merger Agreement requires the Company, promptly after the date of the Merger Agreement,
to request any third party that previously executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an acquisition
proposal to promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such third party and to terminate access to data rooms
furnished to any such third party.

If at any time prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, (i) the Company receives a bona fide acquisition proposal that the
Board reasonably believes, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and Financial Advisors, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and (ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
then the Company may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such third party and (B) furnish to such third party non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement.

Table of Contents

The Company must notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) after receipt of any acquisition proposal or any inquiry,
offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal or any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by any third party that may be considering making, or has made or could be reasonably expected to make, an acquisition
proposal. The Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours), of any material
developments regarding, or any material change to the terms and status of, any such acquisition proposal.

Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement and described below, the Board will not:
 

 
•  withdraw or withhold, or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Board recommendation or publicly announce

that it has proposed or resolved to take such action;
 

 •  fail to include the Board recommendation in the Company’s proxy statement;
 

 

•  in the event any tender or exchange offer is commenced that would constitute an acquisition proposal, fail to publish, send or
provide to the Company stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, and within ten business days after
such tender or exchange offer is first commenced, or subsequently amended in any material respect, a statement
recommending that the Company stockholders reject such tender or exchange offer and publicly affirming the Board
recommendation; or

 

 
•  recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, or publicly propose or resolve to recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, any

acquisition proposal or any letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement.

We refer to each of the actions or events in the bullets above as an “adverse recommendation change.”

Prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, the Board may:
 

 
•  effect an adverse recommendation change in respect of an acquisition proposal, or enter into an agreement providing for a

transaction that constitutes a superior proposal, if:
 

 
•  the Company shall have received an acquisition proposal that the Board determines, in good faith, after consultation

with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisors, constitutes a superior proposal,
 

 
•  the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take action with

respect to such superior proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law,

 

 •  the Company has provided four business days prior written notice to Parent that it intends to take such action,
 

 

•  if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the
terms or conditions of the Merger Agreement during such four business day period, the Board shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisors), after considering the terms of
such offer by Parent, that the superior proposal giving rise to the notice by the Company continues to be a superior
proposal,

 

 
•  in the case of the Board entering into an agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal, the

Company terminates the Merger Agreement; and

•  if any superior proposal is revised, then the Company shall deliver to Parent a new notice and again comply with the
above requirements with respect to such revised superior proposal on each occasion on which a revised superior
proposal is submitted, provided, that in connection with each new notice, each reference to a four business day period
in the bullets above shall be deemed to be a reference to a three business day period.

 

 

•  in response to any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to the Board prior to obtaining the Company
stockholder approval and does not involve or relate to an acquisition proposal, effect an adverse recommendation change if:

 

 
•  the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect such adverse

recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
 

 •  the Company provided four business days prior written notice to Parent that it intends to take such action, and
 

 

•  if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the
terms or conditions of the Merger Agreement during such four business day period, the Board shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisors), after considering the terms of
such offer by Parent, that the failure to effect such adverse recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

The Merger Agreement does not prohibit the Company or the Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S.
federal or state law or other applicable laws, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or an acquisition proposal (provided, that neither the Company nor the Board may
recommend any acquisition proposal or make an adverse recommendation change unless permitted by the Merger Agreement), (ii)
making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, or (iii) contacting and engaging in discussions with any person or group and their respective representatives who has made an
acquisition proposal that was not solicited in breach of the Merger Agreement solely for the purpose of clarifying such acquisition
proposal and the terms thereof.

Company Stockholder Approval

The Company is required to mail this proxy statement as promptly as reasonably possible after the date the SEC staff advises that the
SEC has no further comments to this proxy statement or that the Company may commence mailing this proxy statement.

The Company is required to take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a stockholders’ meeting on a date as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement for the purpose of obtaining the Company stockholder approval
and, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of
a proposal to the stockholders of the Company for a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become
payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger. The Company is required to take
all lawful action to solicit the approval of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders. The Company is not entitled to change the record
date for the stockholders’ meeting without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable law. Except to the extent the
Company has effected an adverse recommendation change in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement:

•  the Board is required to recommend the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders and

is required to include that recommendation in this proxy statement, and
 

 
•  neither the Board nor any committee of the Board may withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw or

modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent the Board’s recommendation, or take any other action or make any other
public statement in connection with the stockholders’ meeting inconsistent with such recommendation.

If at any time prior to the effective time of the Merger any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to this proxy statement, so that this proxy statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information is required to promptly notify the other parties to the Merger Agreement and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable
law, disseminated to the Company stockholders.

Without limiting the Company’s right to enter into a superior proposal and terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, (i) the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the stockholders’ meeting and to
hold a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not be affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to the Company of any acquisition proposal (whether or not a superior proposal), or by an adverse recommendation change
by the Board, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes an adverse recommendation change, the Company remains obligated to
submit the Merger Agreement to a vote of its stockholders, although the Company would not be obligated to recommend to its
stockholders the adoption of the Merger Agreement at any meeting to the extent that the Board has made an adverse recommendation
change.

The Merger Agreement requires Parent to vote all shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its
subsidiaries in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement at the stockholders meeting.

Required Governmental Approvals and Other Consents

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to cooperate with one another
and use their reasonable best efforts to:
 

 
•  take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

any applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable;
 

 

•  obtain from any governmental authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, clearances, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or avoid
any legal proceeding by any governmental authority, in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 

 

•  as promptly as is reasonably practicable but in any event within ten business days after the date of the Merger Agreement (or
within 30 calendar days after the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to certain identified required governmental
approvals) make or cause to be made the applications or filings required to be made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
and the subsidiaries of the Company under or with respect to the required governmental approvals or any other applicable
laws in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and the payment of any fees due in connection
with such applications or filings;

Table of Contents

 

•  comply at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any request under or with respect to the required governmental
approvals and any such other applicable laws for additional information, documents or other materials received by Parent or
the Company from the FTC, the DOJ, the FCC, CFIUS, Team Telecom or any other governmental authority in connection
with such applications or filings or the Merger;

 

 •  defend any legal proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; and
 

 

•  coordinate and cooperate with, and give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the
other party in connection with, making any filing under or with respect to the required governmental approvals or any such
other applicable laws and any filings, conferences or other submissions related to resolving any investigation or other
inquiry by any governmental authority.

Each of the Company and Parent is required to use its reasonable best efforts to, and cause their respective subsidiaries to, furnish to
the other party all information necessary (including, but not limited to, information about or from their respective direct or indirect
owners) for any such application or other filing to be made in connection with the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent must
promptly inform the other of any material communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
governmental authority regarding any such application or filing. If a party intends to independently participate in any meeting with any
governmental authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then that party is required to give the other party
reasonable prior notice of such meeting and invite representatives of the other party to participate in the meeting unless prohibited by
the governmental authority. The Merger Agreement requires the Company and Parent to cooperate with each other with respect to all
matters relating to any governmental authority relating to any regulatory, governmental, CFIUS or Team Telecom Agencies matters.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Company and Parent shall both, to the extent practicable, have the opportunity to participate
in all meetings with, review communications to, and receive copies of communications from, any governmental authority in connection
with obtaining any necessary regulatory, governmental, CFIUS or Team Telecom Agencies clearances.

The Merger Agreement requires Parent to take any and all actions and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any applicable law that may be asserted by any governmental authority (including, without
limitation, those in connection with the required governmental approvals) with respect to the Merger so as to enable the consummation
of the Merger to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than November 18, 2017, which we refer to as the
“end date”). However, nothing in the Merger Agreement requires Parent to:
 

 

•  take or agree to take any action with respect to (A) any of its affiliates (other than the Company or its subsidiaries) or any
direct or indirect portfolio companies of investment funds advised or managed by one or more affiliates of Parent or any
investment funds advised or managed by one or more affiliates of Parent, including selling, divesting, conveying, holding
separate, or otherwise limiting its freedom of action with respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses, businesses,
operations, or interest therein, of any such affiliates or any direct or indirect portfolio companies of investment funds advised
or managed by one or more affiliates of Parent or any investment funds advised or managed by one or more affiliates of
Parent or (B) the selling, divesting, conveying or holding separate with respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses,
businesses, operations, or interest therein, of Parent, the Company or any of its subsidiaries in more than a de minimis
respect, or

 

 

•  be required to accept or agree to any burdensome condition, which for purposes of the Merger Agreement is defined to mean
any actions or undertakings necessary to obtain the approval of CFIUS, the Team Telecom Agencies or any other
governmental authority that, pursuant to a mitigation agreement or otherwise, would impose requirements on the Company
and its subsidiaries (or their assets and businesses) that individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect in any material respect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided that any such actions or undertakings that are substantially similar to the terms of
mitigation agreements previously entered into by Parent’s affiliates with CFIUS and the Team Telecom Agencies with
respect to their acquisition of Tampnet would not be a burdensome condition.

Table of Contents

The Company and Parent are required to give any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective subsidiaries to use,
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents under any Company material agreements necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger. The Company and Parent will coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, notices, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be given or obtained, or should be given or obtained, from parties to any Company material agreements.

Until the earlier of the effective time of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent
and the Company are required to promptly notify each other in writing of any pending or threatened legal proceedings challenging or
seeking material damages in connection with the Merger or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or
otherwise limit in any material respect the right of Parent to own or operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

If any legal proceeding is instituted by a governmental authority challenging the Merger as violative of applicable law, the Merger
Agreement requires each of the Company and Parent to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist, except
insofar as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree, any such legal proceeding, including any legal proceeding that seeks a
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the Merger.

The Merger Agreement states that nothing in the Merger Agreement gives Parent or Merger Sub the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger and that prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Company
will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its
business operations.

Continuing Employees

The Merger Agreement requires that, during the one-year period following the effective time of the Merger, Parent and its affiliates
provide each continuing employee for so long as the employee is employed during that one-year period:
 

 
•  an annual base salary or wage level and cash bonus opportunity at least equal to the annual base salary or wage level and

cash bonus opportunity to which the continuing employees were entitled immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger,

 

 
•  severance benefits that are no less favorable than those severance benefits provided under the Company benefit or

compensation plans or arrangements immediately prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, and
 

 
•  benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the

benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment that such continuing employees were entitled to
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger under the Company benefit or compensation plans or arrangements.

The Merger Agreement further requires Parent or its affiliates to pay annual bonuses for the Company’s fiscal year that includes the
effective time of the Merger in accordance with the Company’s 2017 TIP.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, after the effective time of the Merger, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to:
 

 

•  ensure that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability
or good health or actively-at-work exclusions are applicable to any continuing employees or their dependents or
beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees or their dependents or beneficiaries may be eligible
to participate; and

Table of Contents

 

•  provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred previously by continuing employees (and their
dependents or beneficiaries) during any plan year in which such continuing employees (and their dependents or
beneficiaries) commence participation under any other welfare plans shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deducible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of- pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on
coverage under any such other welfare benefit plans for which participation commences during any plan year.

The Merger Agreement further requires that all continuing employees receive credit for all service with the Company, its subsidiaries
and their predecessors, prior to the closing of the Merger for all purposes, including, eligibility to participate, vesting credit, eligibility
to commence benefits, benefit accrual (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit levels (i) under any defined benefit pension
plan or retiree welfare plan or (ii) which would result in any duplication of benefits for the same periods of service), early retirement
subsidies and severance.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance

The Merger Agreement provides that, after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, and will advance expenses as incurred to, each current and former director and
officer of Lumos Networks and its subsidiaries, which we refer to as “indemnitees,” against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards incurred in connection with any proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective
time of the Merger, including the fact that such indemnitee is or was a director or officer of Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries
or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the effective time of the Merger, to the same extent any such indemnitee
would have been entitled to under Delaware law and under the organizational documents of Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries
in effect on of the date of the Merger Agreement. Any indemnitee receiving an advancement of expenses will be required to provide, as
a condition to such advancement, an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification.

The Merger Agreement also requires that, for a period of six years after the effective time of the Merger:
 

 

•  the surviving corporation will assume, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to assume, the obligations of Lumos
Networks and its subsidiaries with respect to rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger existing in favor of indemnitees as provided in the
organizational documents of Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries or in any indemnification contract between an
indemnitee and Lumos Networks or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement;
and

 

 

•  the surviving corporation will maintain, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to maintain, provisions of the
surviving corporation’s organizational documents with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and indemnification and
advancement of expenses of officers and directors of the Company that are no less favorable to the indemnitees than were
set forth in the organizational documents of Lumos Networks as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. During that
period, the surviving corporation will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of any indemnitee. If any actual or threatened claim is made during that period, all
indemnification rights related to that claim will continue until the disposition or resolution of such the action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in accordance with the surviving corporation’s organizational documents.

The Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the effective time of the Merger, Lumos Networks will or, will cause the surviving
corporation as of the effective time of the Merger to, obtain and pay for a six-year non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and
officers’ liability coverage of Lumos Networks’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies, which we refer to as “D&O insurance,” with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
effective time of the Merger. The extension of the D&O insurance, or “tail,” is required to be obtained from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as Lumos Networks’ current

Networks and the surviving corporation do not obtain such D&O insurance on or prior to the effective time of the Merger, the
surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
years from and after the effective time of the Merger, the D&O insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with Lumos
Networks’ current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under Lumos Networks’ existing
policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Alternatively, the surviving corporation will purchase from Lumos Networks’ current
insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating comparable D&O insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than as provided in Lumos Networks’
existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, but under no circumstance will Lumos Networks pay, or will Parent or the
surviving corporation be required to pay, a one-time premium in connection with the “tail” policy in excess of 300% of the amount per
year that Lumos Networks paid in its last full fiscal year or annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per year that Lumos
Networks paid in its last full fiscal year. If the aggregate premiums of the D&O insurance required to be maintained exceed these
limits, then Lumos Networks or the surviving corporation will only be required to obtain a D&O insurance policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such limits.

The Merger Agreement provides that if Parent, the surviving corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
Merger Agreement obligations described above with respect to indemnification, exculpation, advance or expenses and D&O insurance.

Parent Financing

The Merger Agreement provides that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the equity financing and the debt financing on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letters (taking into
account related “market flex” provisions contained in the debt commitment letters) (or such other terms and conditions acceptable to
Parent so long as such terms and conditions satisfy the requirement set forth below with respect to substitute financing) and to
consummate the equity financing and debt financing, which we collectively refer to as the financing, on the closing date and shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy, under the equity commitment letter
and the debt commitment letters, which we collectively refer to as the financing commitments, without the prior written consent of the
Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would:
 

 

•  reduce the aggregate amount of the financing (including by increasing the fees payable thereunder or the original issue
discount applicable to the financing) below the amount, which we refer to as the “required financing amount,” required for
Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i) the
payment of the Merger Consideration for all of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis,
(ii) making all payments in respect of the Company stock options, Company restricted stock and Company Purchase Rights,
(iii) the repayment or refinancing of all indebtedness of the Company required to be repaid under the Merger Agreement and
(iv) the payment of all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representatives pursuant to the
Merger Agreement;

 

 
•  impose new or additional conditions, or expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the financing that

would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

•  materially delay or impair the availability of the financing at the closing or materially impede the satisfaction of the

conditions to obtaining the financing; or
 

 •  adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties.

We refer to any amendments, modifications or waivers that would have any of results or impacts described in the bullets above as a
restricted financing commitment amendment. The Merger Agreement allows Parent to amend the financing commitments without the
consent of the Company to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
financing commitments as of the date of the Merger Agreement so long as any such amendment is not a restricted financing
commitment amendment.

The Merger Agreement requires Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to:
 

 •  maintain in effect the financing commitments;
 

 
•  satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the marketing period) all conditions to obtaining the financing that are within

its control or subject to its influence;
 

 

•  enter into definitive agreements with respect to the financing commitments on the terms and conditions contained in the
financing commitments (taking into account related “market flex” provisions contained in the debt commitment letters) (or
such other terms and conditions acceptable to Parent so long as such terms and conditions satisfy the requirement set forth
below with respect to substitute financing);

 

 
•  fully pay (including from the proceeds of the financing) any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid under

the financing commitments on or prior to the closing date;
 

 •  enforce its rights under the financing commitments; and
 

 
•  in the event that all conditions in the financing commitments have been satisfied, consummate the financing on or before the

closing date.

The Merger Agreement requires Parent to provide a copy of any amendment, supplement or modification of the financing
commitments to the Company.

The Merger Agreement provides that if funds in the amounts set forth in the financing commitments, or any portion thereof, become
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth therein (taking into account related “market flex” provisions contained in the debt
commitment letters), then Parent will, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event:
 

 •  notify the Company in writing thereof;
 

 

•  use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are no less favorable (taking into
account related “market flex” provisions contained in the debt commitment letters) to Parent and Merger Sub, than the terms
and conditions as set forth in the financing commitments (taking into account any “market flex” provisions with respect to
the debt commitment letters) in an amount, when added to the portion of the financing commitments that is still available,
that is no less than the required financing amount; and

 

 

•  deliver to the Company copies of the new commitment letter and fee letter with respect to any such substitute financing (in a
redacted form removing fee information, economic terms of the “market flex” provisions and other economic provisions that
are customarily redacted in connection with Merger Agreements of this type, but which redacted information does not relate
to the aggregate amount of commitments under the financing, the availability of the financing or the conditionality of, or
contain any conditions precedent to, the funding of the substitute financing) and related definitive financing documents with
respect to such substitute financing.

The Merger Agreement provides that Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice:
 

 
•  of any material breach or material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,

could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or material default) by any party to any financing
commitment or definitive document related to the financing;

 

 

•  of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any debt financing sources with respect to any
actual or threatened material breach, material default, withdrawal, early termination or repudiation by any debt financing
sources of any provisions of the financing commitments or any definitive document related to the financing that would, in
any such case, reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timely availability (taking into account the timing of the
marketing period) or the amount of the financing commitments;

 

 •  of any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the financing commitments or any related fee letters;
 

 
•  of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the financing commitments (other than customary

negotiations in the ordinary course between or among any parties to the financing commitments with respect to the
definitive documentation for the financing); and

 

 
•  if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that there is a reasonable possibility that it will not be able to

timely obtain (taking into account the timing of the marketing period) all or any portion of the financing.

The Merger Agreement provides that, despite the notice obligation of Parent described above, Parent is not required to disclose any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the financing or any substitute financing. The Merger Agreement does not
obligate Parent to pay any fees or agree to pay any interest rate amounts, in either case, in excess of those contemplated by the
financing commitments (taking into account any “market flex” provisions with respect to the debt commitment letters) or to
consummate the debt financing prior to the completion of the marketing period.

The Merger Agreement requires the Company to, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors and employees to, and to use its reasonable best efforts to direct its and their respective accountants, legal
counsel and other representatives to, at Parent’s sole expense, provide Parent with all cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement of the debt financing contemplated by the financing commitments, including the following:
 

 

•  assisting Parent in preparation for, and participating with Parent in, the marketing efforts for the debt financing, including,
without limitation, participation in (and causing senior members of management and representatives of the Company and its
subsidiaries to participate in) a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings), presentations,
conference calls, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and other sessions with the debt
financing sources, prospective lenders and investors and rating agencies in connection with the financing and providing
assistance to Parent in obtaining ratings as contemplated by the debt financing;

 

 

•  assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations and bank information memoranda (including
(x) the delivery of an additional bank information memorandum that does not include material non-public information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective securities and (y) execution and delivery of one
or more customary authorization and representation letters contemplated by the debt commitment letters or otherwise that
are customary for such financing), lender presentations and similar documents required in connection with the marketing
and syndication of the financing; provided, that any such bank information memoranda shall contain disclosure and financial
statements with respect to the Company or the surviving corporation reflecting the surviving corporation and/or its
subsidiaries as the obligor(s); provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to prepare any projections;

any information that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege if the Company shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege or (z) to produce or prepare any projections

it would:

Sub, the EQT Fund, the equity financing sources and other persons related to Parent, Merger Sub, the EQT Fund and the equity
financing sources, as well as by (ii) the debt financing sources and other persons related to the debt financing sources in connection

goodwill.

The Merger Agreement provides that if the Company has remaining sufficient cash and access to undrawn available lines of credit to

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger

The obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, to the
extent permitted by applicable law) of the following conditions at or prior to the effective time of the Merger:
 

 •  the Company stockholder approval shall have been obtained;
 

 

•  no restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or
governmental authority or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have taken
effect after the date hereof and shall still be in effect, and no applicable law shall have been adopted, enacted, issued,
enforced, entered, or promulgated in any jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries engage in business
activities that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger, provided, however, that prior to invoking this
condition the relevant party shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under the Merger Agreement
with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals; and

 

 
•  the required governmental approvals shall have been obtained (or in the case of required governmental approvals that only

require notification, such notification shall have been made).

The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) waiver at or prior to the effective time of the Merger of the following conditions:
 

 •  the representations and warranties of the Company with respect to:
 

 

•  corporate organization, existence, authority, enforceability, Board approval and recommendation of the Merger and
the Merger Agreement, capitalization, indebtedness for borrowed money and Financial Advisors’ fees shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date as if made as of
such date (other than any such representation and warranty that by its terms addresses matters only as of another
specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of such date) (which, with respect to the representations and
warranties with respect to capitalization (with respect to the Company only), indebtedness for borrowed money and
Financial Advisors’ fees will mean that there are no inaccuracies in such representations and warranties that,
individually or in the aggregate, would result in the sum of (x) the increase in the aggregate amount of consideration
required to be paid to the holders of the shares of Company stock, Company stock options, Company restricted stock,
Company Purchase Rights and the Warrant, (y) the increase in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and its subsidiaries outstanding as of the date of the Merger

aggregate), and

the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date as if made as of such date;

only as another specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of such date), except, for such failures to be true and
correct that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a company material
adverse effect;    

 

 
•  the Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations and covenants required to be performed by it under

the Merger Agreement at or prior to the closing date;
 

 •  since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall not have occurred a company material adverse effect; and
 

 
•  Parent’s receipt of a certificate signed by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company dated as of the

closing date certifying that the closing conditions specified above have been satisfied.

The obligations of the Company to effect the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted by applicable
law) of the following conditions:
 

 

•  the representations and warranties of Parent contained in the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct (without giving
effect to any qualifications or limitations as to materiality or parent material adverse effect set forth in such representations
and warranties) as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date as if made as of such date (other than any
such representations and warranty that by its terms addresses matters only as another specified date, which shall be true and
correct only as of such date), except for such failures to be true and correct that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a parent material adverse effect. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a
parent material adverse effect means any change, effect, event, development, fact, condition, circumstance or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or materially
delay Parent’s or Merger Sub’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 

 
•  Parent shall have performed in all material respects all obligations and covenants required to be performed by it under the

Merger Agreement at or prior to the closing date; and
 

 
•  the Company’s receipt of a certificate signed by an executive officer of Parent and dated as of the closing date, certifying

that the closing conditions specified above have been satisfied.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The Merger Agreement provides that it may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time of
the Merger, whether before or, except as described below, after the receipt of the Company stockholder approval as follows:
 

 •  By mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;
 

 •  By either Parent or the Company, if:
 

 
•  the Merger has not been consummated on or before November 18, 2017, which we refer to as the “end date,”

provided, that:
 

 

•  each of Parent and the Company may, in its respective sole discretion, extend the end date to a date not beyond
February 18, 2018 if any required governmental approval has not yet been obtained but all other conditions to
closing have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing and that would have been satisfied if the closing were to have occurred on the end date) by delivering
notice of such extension to the other party not less than three business days prior to the end date. Upon any such
extension, Parent will seek an

extension of the debt commitment letters to February 18, 2018 on terms not less favorable to Parent, in any
material respect, than those set forth in the debt commitment letters, provided, that, (a) if the debt commitment
letters are extended for a period ending earlier than February 18, 2018, the end date may only be extended for
such shorter period of time and (b) if the debt commitment letters are not extended for any period, the end date
will remain November 18, 2017; and

 

 

•  neither party may extend the end date or terminate the Merger Agreement if the failure of the Merger to have
been consummated on or before the end date was due to the breach of the party seeking to terminate the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that neither Parent nor Merger Sub will be deemed to be in breach
of the Merger Agreement solely as a result of its inability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement on the date the closing was required to occur due to the proceeds of the debt financing not
being available in full pursuant to the terms of the debt financing, although the foregoing will not impact
Parent’s obligation to pay the parent termination fee, if otherwise due, pursuant to terms of the Merger
Agreement;

 

 

•  there shall be any permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal
restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger and such injunction or other order, restraint or
prohibition shall have become final and nonappealable, provided, that this termination right will not be available to a
party if the injunction, order, restraint or other prohibition being issued resulted from the breach of any of such party’s
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach
would result in a failure of a condition precedent to the obligation of the Company to close; or

 

 
•  at the Company stockholder meeting (including any subsequent meeting following an adjournment or postponement

thereof) at which a vote to adopt the Merger Agreement is taken, the Company stockholder approval shall not have
been obtained;

 

 •  by Parent, if:
 

 •  there shall have been an adverse recommendation change; or
 

 

•  a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the

that gives rise to a termination right under the next bullet below; and (ii) the Company shall not have the right to
terminate the Merger Agreement as provided in this bullet if it is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach would result in a

obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to close; or

 

 •  each of the following is satisfied:
 

 
•  all of the conditions to closing of all parties have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by

their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which would have been satisfied if the closing were to have

that the closing should have occurred and fail to consummate the closing by the close of business on the second
business day following receipt of the notice from the Company referred to in the bullet above.

The Merger Agreement requires the party desiring to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to any of the above termination rights
(other than pursuant to the mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent) to give notice of such termination to the other party.

Effect of Termination

The Merger Agreement provides that if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the termination rights described above,
the Merger Agreement will become void and of no effect without liability of any party or any of its related parties, on the one hand, to
the other party and its related parties, on the other hand, except that the confidentiality agreement between the parties (to the extent set
forth therein), the termination equity commitment letter (to the extent set forth therein) and specifically enumerated provisions of the
Merger Agreement shall survive any such termination, and except in circumstances where the company termination fee is payable in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, no such termination shall relieve the Company from liability or damages to Parent
resulting from any willful breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set for in the
Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement defines a willful breach as (i) a material breach that is a consequence of an act or failure to
act undertaken by the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would, or would
reasonably be expected to, cause a breach of the Merger Agreement or (ii) fraud.

authorization, entering into a written agreement concerning a superior proposal;

Merger Agreement is taken but the Company stockholder approval is not obtained and, at such time, Parent would have been
entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of an adverse recommendation change by the Board; or

 

 

•  if (A) the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the Company as a result of the Merger not being effected by the
end date (but only if the Company stockholder meeting has not been held prior to the end date) or as a result of the failure to
obtain the Company stockholder approval at the Company stockholder meeting at which a vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement is taken (and at the time of termination all conditions to the consummation of the Merger, other than receipt of
Company stockholder approval, have been satisfied or waived) or (ii) by Parent as a result of a material and uncured breach
of the Merger Agreement by the Company, (B) an acquisition proposal shall have been publicly announced after the date of

termination fee,” of $32,138,000 under any of the following circumstances:
 

 

•  if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company as the result of a breach of any representation or warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the Merger Agreement shall have
occurred that would cause the conditions to the obligation of the Company to close not to be satisfied and to be incapable of
being satisfied by the end date, except that, if such breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub through the exercise of its
reasonable best efforts, then, until the earlier of (x) three business days prior to the end date and (y) 30 days after receipt by
Parent of notice from the Company of such breach, but only as long as Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, continues to use
its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, such termination shall become effective only if the breach is not cured within

The Merger Agreement provides that in the event of its termination by the Company or Parent at the Company stockholder meeting at
which a vote to adopt the Merger Agreement is taken but the Company stockholder approval is not obtained, then the Company shall

therefor for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors,
consultants and other representatives (including financing sources) incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates in
connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, up to an aggregate maximum of $3,500,000, which
amount shall be credited against any company termination fee that becomes subsequently payable to Parent.

If the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to promptly pay any of the amounts described above, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for any such amount, then the Merger
Agreement requires the Company or Parent, as applicable, to pay to the other party hereto its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such fee from the date such payment was required to be
made to the date of payment at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be

The Merger Agreement provides that if the Company fails to effect the closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise
breaches the Merger Agreement or fails to perform thereunder, then, except for an order of specific performance as and only to the
extent expressly permitted as described below, Parent’s and Merger Sub’s sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in

Specific Performance

The Merger Agreement provides that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions thereof in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and provides for the parties’ waiver of any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or proof
of actual damages in connection with any such remedy. The Merger Agreement also specifically provides that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded in accordance
with the terms of the equity commitment letter and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement to occur at the closing, including by demanding Parent to fully enforce the EQT Fund’s
obligations under the equity commitment letter and Parent’s rights thereunder, if, and only if:
 

 

•  all of the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to close (other than those conditions that by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the closing date, but each of which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied upon the closing
date) have been satisfied by, and remain satisfied on, the date the closing is required to have occurred and no event shall
have occurred nor shall any condition exist that would cause any of such conditions to fail to be satisfied,

 

 •  Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the closing on the date the closing is required to have occurred,
 

 
•  the debt financing provided for by the debt commitment letters has been funded or the debt financing sources have

confirmed that the debt financing will be funded at the closing, if the equity financing is funded at the closing, and
 

 
•  the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able for the closing to occur if

specific performance is granted and that if the equity financing and debt financing are funded, then the closing will occur.

In the Merger Agreement, each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in the Merger Agreement, subject to the limitations described above. Until
such time as Parent pays the parent termination fee, the remedies available to the Company pursuant the Merger Agreement shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement and collect the
parent termination fee as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and described above. The Merger Agreement provides that there is
no requirement for any party to institute any proceeding for specific performance prior to or as a condition to exercising any
termination right or receiving any termination fee and that the commencement of any legal proceeding or the seeking of specific
performance shall not restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance as provided for in the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that while the parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent
permitted by the Merger Agreement and the payment of the company termination fee or parent termination fee, under no circumstances
shall a party be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to require a party to consummate the closing and
payment of the company termination fee or parent termination fee.

Costs and Expenses

The Merger Agreement provides that, except as otherwise provided therein, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses.

Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment

The Merger Agreement provides that it shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties thereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and no provision of the Merger Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any person other than the parties and their respective successors and assigns, other than:

•  with respect to the provisions regarding the obligations of the Merger Sub, which shall inure to the benefit of the persons or

entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof,

inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, certain related parties of the Company and Parent, as the case may be.

Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides that the debt financing sources and their related parties are express third party
beneficiaries and have the right to enforce provisions of the Merger Agreement.

Amendments; Waivers

The Merger Agreement provides that except for certain provisions of which the debt financing sources and their related parties are
express third party beneficiaries, which may not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived in a manner materially adverse to
them without the express written consent of the debt financing sources, the Merger Agreement may only be amended or waived prior to
the effective time of the Merger if such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to
the Merger Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. However, after receipt of
the Company stockholder approval, no amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of the stockholders of the
Company under Delaware Law is permitted without such approval having first been obtained.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

The Merger Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of Delaware, provided, that the debt financing and all actions related to the debt financing are be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except as expressly specified otherwise in the debt commitment letters
or in any definitive document related to such financing).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, with respect to any legal proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, each of the parties will submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or other Delaware state court. Each of the parties agreed to bring any litigation against any financing source in
connection with the Merger Agreement, the debt financing or the transactions contemplated thereby exclusively in any New York state
or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan.

Each of the parties irrevocably waived any and all right to trial by jury in any proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating
to the Merger Agreement, Merger or the debt financing.

PROPOSAL 1 – ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger. For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, see the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 86. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement
as Appendix A.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

As discussed in the section entitled “The Merger—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger” beginning
on page 46, after considering various factors described in such section, the members of the Board voting on the Merger have
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and advisable and in
the best interests of Lumos Networks and its stockholders. All members of the Board voting on the Merger (i) approved the execution,
delivery and performance by Lumos Networks of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Lumos Networks and its
stockholders, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Lumos Networks for adoption and
(iv) declared that the Merger Agreement is advisable. The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

Under Delaware law, the adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote at
the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the merger proposal.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

PROPOSAL 2 – ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to a later
date or dates if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If our stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders and any adjourned session of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and use the additional time to solicit
additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies
voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that,
even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the
merger proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders without a vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock to change their votes to votes
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders if a
quorum is not present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

In addition, the Board could postpone the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders before it commences, subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement. If the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is adjourned or postponed, stockholders who have already submitted
their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before such proxies are voted at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, as
adjourned or postponed. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

Approval of the adjournment proposal, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock represented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, either in person or by proxy,
and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions as to the adjournment proposal with respect to shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock
otherwise present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and entitled to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.

The Board believes that it is in the best interests of Lumos Networks and its stockholders to be able to adjourn the 2017 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to a later date or dates if necessary for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in respect of the merger
proposal if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

In addition, if a quorum is not present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock represented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders,
either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon, although less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting to another place, date
or time (subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement).

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

PROPOSAL 3 – ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED NAMED
EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Lumos Networks is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a
non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that will or may become payable to the named executive officers of Lumos Networks
in connection with the Merger, including the agreements and understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may become
payable, the value of which is set forth under “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Lumos Networks in
the Merger—Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 71.

For purposes of this proxy statement, our named executive officers consist of:
 

 •  Timothy G. Biltz, President and Chief Executive Officer;
 

 •  Johan G. Broekhuysen, Executive vice President and Chief Financial Officer;
 

 •  Diego B. Anderson, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Residential and Small Business;
 

 •  Mary McDermott—General Counsel, Senior Vice President; and
 

 •  Thomas E. Ferry, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer.

The Board encourages you to carefully review the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this
proxy statement. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Lumos Networks is asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption
of the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to
Lumos Networks’ named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the agreements and understandings pursuant to
which such compensation will or may become payable, as disclosed under “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive
Officers of Lumos Networks in the Merger—Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation,” in Lumos Networks’ proxy
statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.”

Stockholders should note that this proposal is separate and apart from Proposal 1 above and is not a condition to completion of the
Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Lumos Networks, the Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans
and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the
outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation
that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

majority of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. Abstentions with respect to shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock otherwise present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders and entitled to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the advisory executive compensation proposal, but
the failure to vote your shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Broker
non-votes will have no effect on the Merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal. If you sign and return a proxy and
do not indicate how you wish to vote on the executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal, your shares of Lumos Networks
Common Stock will be voted in favor of the proposal.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE MERGER-RELATED NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER
COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE ELECTION AS
DIRECTORS OF THE NOMINEES NAMED ABOVE.

Committees of the Board of Directors

We have the following standing committees of the Board: Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Nominating and
Governance Committee. Each committee has a charter which is available for review at the following website,
www.lumosnetworks.com. The charters may be found by clicking “Investor Relations” and then “Governance Documents.”

Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee presently consists of Mr. O’Donnell (Chairperson) and Messrs. Guth and Pruellage. The Compensation
Committee met six times during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Compensation Committee is responsible for:
 

 •  developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executive officers;
 

 •  determining the compensation and benefits of the CEO and all other executive officers;
 

 •  reviewing our compensation and benefit plans to ensure that they meet corporate objectives;
 

 •  selecting compensation consultants and determining the frequency of use of compensation consultants; and
 

 •  administering our stock plans and other incentive compensation plans.

The Board has determined that all of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent as defined in Rule 5605(d)(2)(A)
of the NASDAQ Listing Standards, are “non-employee directors” as defined in SEC Rule 16b-3, and are “outside directors” as defined
in Section 162(m) of the Code.

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee presently consists of Messrs. Vaughn (Chairperson), Aquino, Robinson and Sicoli. The Audit Committee met
five times during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing:

 •  the reliability of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
 

 •  the effective evaluation, analysis and management of our financial risks;
 

 •  legal and tax related matters and our compliance with laws and regulations;
 

 •  the maintenance of an effective and efficient internal audit function; and
 

 
•  the planning, conduct and performance of and the compensation paid for the annual audits of our consolidated financial

statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by an independent registered public
accounting firm.

The Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the
NASDAQ Listing Standards and Sections 10A(m)(3)(a) and (B) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Board has determined that all
members of the Audit Committee are financially literate as prescribed by the NASDAQ Listing Standards and that Messrs. Robinson,
Sicoli and Vaughn are each an “audit committee financial expert,” within the meaning of the regulations promulgated by the SEC. No
member of the Audit Committee received any payments in 2016 from us or our subsidiaries other than compensation received as a
director of Lumos Networks.

Nominating and Governance Committee

The Nominating and Governance Committee presently consists of Messrs. Robinson (Chairperson), Askowitz, Pruellage, and Vaughn.
The Nominating and Governance Committee met two times during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Nominating and
Governance Committee is responsible for:
 

 •  identifying individuals qualified to become directors;
 

 •  nominating qualified individuals for election to the Board at the annual meeting of stockholders;
 

 •  recommending to the Board the individual directors to serve on the committees of the Board; and
 

 •  overseeing corporate governance matters.

The Board has determined that all of the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent as defined in
Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Standards.

Corporate Governance Matters

Identifying and Evaluating Nominees

The Investors Rights Agreement currently entitles Pamplona to designate two members of the Board.

The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies nominees for director on its own as well as by considering recommendations
from other members of the Board, our officers and employees, and other sources that the Nominating and Governance Committee
deems appropriate, including executive search firms. The Nominating and Governance Committee also will consider stockholder
recommendations for nominees for director subject to such recommendations being made in accordance with our bylaws. There were
no nominee recommendations from stockholders or any group of stockholders submitted in accordance with our bylaws. In addition to
the Nominating and Governance Committee’s charter, we have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that contain, among other
matters, important information concerning the Nominating and Governance Committee’s responsibilities when identifying and
evaluating nominees for director. You will find the charter and guidelines at www.lumosnetworks.com by selecting the following links:
“Investor Relations” and then “Governance Documents.”

The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that it is generally expected that the Nominating and Governance Committee and the
Board will not nominate a director who would reach the age of 72 by the date of the annual meeting at which he or she would
otherwise be elected. The Board may waive this policy if it believes such a waiver to be in the best interests of the Company. The
Board has determined that waiving this policy with respect to the nomination of director Jerry E. Vaughn is in the best interests of the
Company in light of the importance that Mr. Vaughn continue to serve as the Chairman of the Audit Committee during the period when
the proposed Merger is pending.

represented on the Board and will also take into account the characteristics of each individual under consideration, including that
individual’s competencies, experience, reputation, integrity, independence, potential for conflicts of interest and other appropriate
qualities. The Corporate Governance Guidelines require that in considering the composition of the Board, diversity of backgrounds and
expertise should be emphasized and the Nominating and Governance Committee shall consider the average tenure of the entire Board.

The Nominating and Governance Committee also periodically considers the individual and aggregate skill sets of the Board, based on a
review of:
 

 •  senior leadership experience (public company CEO/President);
 

 •  business development/M&A expertise;
 

 •  financial expertise;
 

 •  public company board of directors experience;
 

 •  diversity (gender/other);
 

 •  telecommunications and high-speed data transport industry operational expertise;
 

 •  other operational expertise (customer service and care, billing systems, IT platform);
 

 •  brand marketing expertise;
 

 •  sales and distribution expertise;
 

 •  government/public policy expertise;
 

 •  executive compensation/human resources expertise; and
 

 •  risk management expertise.

Pursuant to our bylaws, to be eligible for election or re-election, a person must enter into an agreement providing that such person (i) is
not and will not become party to any voting commitment that has not been disclosed to us or could limit or interfere with such person’s
fiduciary duties if elected, (ii) is not and will not become party to any compensation, reimbursement or indemnification agreement with
any person other than us and (iii) will comply with all of our applicable corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and
stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines. When considering a director standing for re-election, in addition to the attributes
described above, the Nominating and Governance Committee shall consider that individual’s past contribution and future commitment
to Lumos Networks. Additionally, the Nominating and Governance Committee will continue to seek to populate the Board with a
sufficient number of independent directors to satisfy NASDAQ Listing Standards and SEC requirements. The Nominating and
Governance Committee will also seek to ensure that the Board will have at least three independent members to serve on the Audit
Committee that satisfy NASDAQ financial and accounting experience requirements and at least one member who qualifies as an “audit
committee financial expert.”

There is no difference in the manner by which the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates prospective nominees for director
based on the source from which the individual was first identified.

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight

Mr. Biltz serves as our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Guth serves as our non-executive Chairman of the Board. Our policy is to
have a Chairman of the Board who is an independent director. We believe having separate Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board positions is the most appropriate structure for Lumos Networks and our stockholders. We believe it is appropriate for Mr. Biltz
to be able to focus his efforts on serving as our Chief Executive Officer while working closely with our Chairman of the Board,
Mr. Guth. The Board may in the future revisit this policy from time to time. The Chairman of the Board has the following duties:
 

 •  preside at all meetings of the Board, including executive sessions of the independent directors;
 

 •  serve as liaison between the Chief Executive Officer and the independent directors;
 

 •  provide advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer on meeting schedules and possible meeting agenda topics;
 

 •  have the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;
 

 
•  provide input to the Compensation Committee regarding the Chief Executive Officer’s performance and meet, together with

the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, with the Chief Executive Officer to discuss the evaluation of the Chief
Executive Officer; and

 

 
•  provide input to the Nominating and Governance Committee regarding the appointment of the Chairpersons and members of

the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.

Table of Contents

The Board also has three standing committees, Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance. Each committee has a separate
chairperson and each of the committees is comprised solely of independent directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide
that the independent directors will meet in executive session at least twice a year, and the Chairman of the Board will preside at these
sessions.

Our Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for evaluating and monitoring our financial risks and
our compliance with laws and regulations. On a regular basis, our Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management our major
financial and operating risks and exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such risks and exposures,
including our risk assessment and risk management policies.

Although the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing these matters, the full Board and our other committees are
actively involved in overseeing risk management. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board and each committee
are responsible for overseeing our program for identifying, evaluating and controlling significant risks. Management updates the entire
Board on a quarterly basis on key business risks affecting our business. The Board also engages in periodic discussions with the Chief
Financial Officer and other members of management regarding risks as appropriate. In addition, each of the other committees of the
Board considers risks within its area of responsibility and regularly reports to the Board.

The Compensation Committee considers succession planning, human resources risks and risks that may be a result of our executive
compensation programs, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section later in this proxy statement. The
Compensation Committee has a Compensation Recoupment Policy that authorizes the Board to obtain reimbursement of any portion of
any performance-based compensation paid or awarded, whether cash or equity based, where the payment or award was predicated upon
the achievement of certain financial results or metrics that are subsequently the subject of a restatement or correction, from the officers
and from other employees responsible for accounting errors resulting in the restatement or correction. The Compensation Committee
also has approved Stock Ownership Guidelines, which are described later in this proxy statement.

The Compensation Committee has considered our incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other employees and does
not believe they pose any material risks to us. With respect to our annual short-term incentive compensation plan, the Compensation
Committee has approved the use of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA as the performance metrics. The Compensation Committee
believes using these metrics does not pose material risk to the Company or its stockholders and, in fact, aligns the interests of our
officers and employees with our stockholders because these are the performance metrics most monitored by the investment community.
Additionally, the annual short-term incentive compensation plan includes individual performance considerations which can be used by
the Compensation Committee to adjust the payout after taking into account the quality of the individual’s performance during the year.
With respect to our long-term incentive plans, the Compensation Committee has approved vesting requirements to incentivize long-
term performance.

The Nominating and Governance Committee, along with the full Board, considers potential governance-related risk matters. The
current leadership structure of the Board supports the risk oversight functions described above with independent leadership provided by
our Chairman of the Board and with eight of our nine directors being independent.

Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors

We encourage stockholders to communicate with the Board by sending written correspondence to the Chairperson of the Nominating
and Governance Committee at: Lumos Networks Corp., Attention: Corporate Secretary, One Lumos Plaza, P.O. Box 1068,
Waynesboro, Virginia 22980. The Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee and his duly authorized agents are
responsible for collecting and organizing stockholder communications. Absent a conflict of interest, the Chairperson of the Nominating
and Governance Committee is responsible for evaluating the materiality of each stockholder communication and determining whether
further distribution is appropriate, and, if so, whether to (i) the full Board, (ii) one or more directors and/or (iii) other individuals or
entities.

Director Independence

The Board considers director independence based both on the meaning of the term “independent director” set forth in Rule 5605(a)(2)
of the NASDAQ Listing Standards and on an overall review of transactions and relationships, if any, between the director and Lumos
Networks. Presently, our Board is comprised of a majority of independent directors and all committees of the Board are comprised only
of independent directors.

In March 2017, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board undertook their annual review of director independence.
There were no transactions or relationships between any director who is not or has not been an officer of Lumos Networks or any
member of his or her immediate family, and Lumos Networks that would be inconsistent with a determination that the director is
independent for the Committee and the Board to consider.

The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board have determined that director nominees Aquino, Askowitz, Guth,
O’Donnell, Pruellage, Robinson, Sicoli and Vaughn are independent under the NASDAQ Listing Standards.

Policy Regarding Attendance at Annual Meetings

We have a policy encouraging directors to attend annual meetings of stockholders. All of our directors serving at the time of the 2016
annual meeting attended the meeting.

Code of Ethics

We have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors, officers and employees. Copies of this code may be found
at the following website, www.lumosnetworks.com. You will find the code by selecting the following links: “Investor Relations” and
then “Governance Documents.”

(1) On January 4, 2016, 5,182 restricted stock awards were granted to each of Messrs. Aquino, Guth, Robinson, Rosenberg, Sicoli
and Vaughn and Ms. North at the closing price on the grant date of $10.97. Additionally, on January 22, 2016 1,504 restricted
stock awards were granted to each of Messrs. Aquino, Guth, Robinson, Rosenberg, Sicoli and Vaughn and Ms. North and 6,686
restricted stock awards were granted to each of Mr. Askowitz and Mr. O’Donnell at the closing price on the grant date of $11.00.
The aggregate number of restricted stock awards outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was 6,686 each for each of Messrs.
Aquino, Askowitz, Guth, O’Donnell, Robinson, Sicoli and Vaughn.

(2) The Company did not issue its directors any stock options in 2016.
(3) Mr. Biltz is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company; as such, he is not compensated for his role as director of

Lumos Networks. The compensation paid to Mr. Biltz for his role as employee of the Company during 2015 is included in the
Summary Compensation table.

(4) Due to his affiliation with Pamplona, Mr. Pruellage does not receive compensation from us for his service as a director.
(5) Ms. North and Mr. Rosenberg did not stand for re-election at the 2016 annual meeting. After Compensation Committee approval

and as permitted by our director compensation policy, the restricted stock awards granted to Ms. North and Mr. Rosenberg on
January 4, 2016 and January 22, 2016 vested as of May 4, 2016.

The Compensation Committee periodically considers our director compensation policy with a primary objective of matching
compensation levels to the relative demands associated with serving on the Board and its various committees. The Compensation
Committee also takes into account the compensation policies of other public company boards of directors by reviewing the same
comparison group of companies as are reviewed by our Compensation Committee when considering the compensation of our executive
officers. In January 2016, after a review of peer compensation benchmarking, the Compensation Committee proposed and the Board
adopted a revised director compensation policy to eliminate meeting fees and increase the annual cash retainer from $25,000 to
$40,000 and the annual equity retainer from $62,000 to $80,000.

During 2016, our non-employee directors (excluding a director affiliated with, and designated by, Pamplona pursuant to our Investors
Rights Agreement and directors who are our employees) were eligible to receive the following cash compensation under our revised
compensation structure:
 

 •  an annual retainer of $40,000, payable monthly;

During 2016, the chairs of the board committees received additional annual retainers, payable monthly:
 

 •  the chairperson of our Board received an annual retainer at the rate of $35,004;
 

 •  the chairperson of our Audit Committee received an annual retainer at the rate of $15,000;
 

 •  the chairperson of our Compensation Committee received an annual retainer at the rate of $5,004; and
 

 •  the chairperson of our Nominating and Governance Committee received an annual retainer of $5,004.

We do not pay compensation to directors who are affiliated with, and designated by, Pamplona pursuant to the Investors Rights
Agreement or who are our employees for their service as directors. However, we do reimburse each of our directors for reasonable
travel and other expenses incurred in connection with attending all Board and Board committee meetings.

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2016, we had seven non-employee independent directors (excluding a director affiliated with, and designated by,
Pamplona pursuant to our Investors Rights Agreement) who were compensated under our director compensation policy: Peter D.
Aquino, Lawrence J. Askowitz, Robert E. Guth, Shawn F. O’Donnell, Michael K. Robinson, Michael T. Sicoli and Jerry E. Vaughn.
The remaining directors who served in 2016 were our current Chief Executive Officer and one representative of Pamplona, William M.
Pruellage. These remaining directors were not compensated by us for their roles as directors. In addition to their director status during
2016, Mr. Guth was chairperson of the Board, Mr. Vaughn was chairperson of the Audit Committee, Mr. O’Donnell was chairperson of
the Compensation Committee and Mr. Robinson was chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee, and they were
compensated accordingly as disclosed in the table above.

To assist us in attracting and retaining qualified and experienced individuals for service as non-employee directors, each such
non-employee director (excluding non-employee directors who are designated by Pamplona pursuant to our Investors Rights
Agreement) receives an initial equity award grant and thereafter, commencing on January 1 of the subsequent year, an annual equity
award grant. These equity award grants in 2016 consisted exclusively of restricted stock in order to generally synchronize the types of
equity awards received by directors with those received by our employees. The annual grant of shares of Lumos Networks Common
Stock is subject to a restriction period (“restricted stock”) with an aggregate value equal to $80,000, or such lesser award for a
particular grant date as the Board shall determine in its sole discretion. The equity award grants generally vest on the first anniversary
of their respective grant dates.

The Board believes that its members should be encouraged to own shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock. In addition to
ownership guidelines applicable to our executive officers, the Board included an ownership and retention requirement applicable to
those directors receiving director compensation. The Stock Ownership Guidelines generally require that each such director own a
minimum number of shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock having a value equal to three times the annual cash retainer for
directors. Each director receiving director compensation generally has three years from the later of November 2011 and his or her date
of appointment to the Board to meet the guidelines. Each director must maintain the minimum value of equity ownership provided in
these Stock Ownership Guidelines.

We also have a policy to provide, as needed, an ongoing education program for all directors and will pay the program costs and
associated travel expenses related to such director education programs.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Our Compensation Philosophy

The objective of our compensation program is to attract and retain those employees whose judgment, abilities and experience will
contribute to our continued success. The program is designed to provide overall competitive pay levels through a mix of base salary,
bonus and equity compensation and ownership, with an emphasis on incentive compensation, create proper incentives to align
management’s incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders and reward superior performance. The Compensation
Committee, which we refer to as the “Committee,” is responsible for the following:
 

 •  developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executive officers;
 

 •  determining the compensation and benefits of our CEO and other executive officers;
 

 •  reviewing our compensation and benefit plans to ensure that they meet corporate objectives;
 

 •  determining the frequency of use of compensation consultants and selecting compensation consultants; and
 

 •  administering our stock plans and other incentive compensation plans.

Executive Summary

As described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Committee believes the overall compensation for our executive
officers, both on a targeted and actual basis, was reasonable and within the range of compensation offered by benchmark companies
and adequately reflected our performance in 2016. Following is a brief overview of our 2016 performance and this performance’s
impact on incentive compensation.

During 2016, we focused on further implementing our growth strategy as a broadband fiber-based service provider focused on data
solutions and mobility, leveraging our fiber network to expand to new FTTC opportunities, enhancing our network and improving
operational performance, improving our addressed marketplace penetration, pursuing near term edge-out marketplace opportunities by
investing in our network through customer success-based capital projects with an emphasis on maximizing capital efficiency, and
increasing our addressable market through significant fiber network expansion projects.

For 2016, we achieved revenue of $206.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) of $95.1 million, representing a margin of
46%. Our data segment, which provided approximately 60% of our total revenue for 2016, represents the main growth opportunity and
the key focal point of our strategy. We experienced sequential year-over-year revenue growth of 8.1% in this segment, primarily
attributable to increases in customer demand for Ethernet-based products and higher bandwidth, as reflected in the 29% growth in our
FTTC revenues and 14% growth in Enterprise Data revenues. The year-over-year growth in FTTC and Enterprise revenues was
partially offset by the decline in our revenue from data transport products, which have been negatively impacted by churn resulting
from network grooming by carriers and migration from legacy technologies to Ethernet products. Our consolidated revenue increased
$2.6 million, or 1.3%, in 2016 due to the growth in our data revenues, partially offset by declines in revenue from our legacy
businesses. Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.1 million, or 3.4%, from 2015 to 2016, primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase
in consolidated revenue. See Appendix C for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable measure reported in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

These strong 2016 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA results led to a 102.2% achievement level in our 2016 TIP.

The Committee Process

Our Committee designs, evaluates and approves our executive compensation plans, policies and programs. The Committee also
annually reviews and evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. To assist in determining the level of compensation and
awards for the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee will review corporate performance over the past 12 months and the Chief
Executive Officer’s compensation relative to the most recent compensation study provided by the Committee’s independent consultant
and peer group data available in public proxy statements, ensuring that the recommended compensation levels meet corporate
objectives.

Additionally, the Committee establishes compensation levels and compensation awards for the other NEOs. For these other NEOs, the
Chief Executive Officer will review individual responsibility and experience and corporate performance data from the most recent
compensation study provided by the Committee’s independent consultant and peer group data available in public proxy statements, and
make recommendations to the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer attends the Committee meetings; however, the Committee also
meets in executive session without the Chief Executive Officer (or other members of management) present when discussing the Chief
Executive Officer’s compensation and other matters.

The Committee also administers our equity-based compensation plans. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on matters
relating to the Committee’s responsibilities. The Chairperson of the Committee works in conjunction with senior management in
establishing the agenda for committee meetings. In addition, the Committee follows regulatory and legislative developments and
considers corporate governance best practices in performing its duties.

Our NEOs

Our Board identifies our executive officers on an annual basis or more frequently when significant organizational changes occur. Our
2016 NEOs were our President and Chief Executive Officer, Timothy G. Biltz, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Johan G. Broekhuysen, our Senior Vice President and General Manager of our R&SB segment, Diego B. Anderson, our Senior
Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Thomas E. Ferry, and our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Mary McDermott.

Consideration of 2015 “Say on Pay” Voting Results

At our 2016 annual meeting, our advisory vote on executive compensation received the support of approximately ninety-seven percent
(97%) of the votes cast on the proposal. The Committee reviewed these results when determining to continue to apply similar cash
compensation objectives, program and rationale for our named executive officers.

Role of Compensation Consultant

The Committee is authorized to retain experts, consultants and other advisors to aid in the discharge of its duties, and engages an
independent compensation consultant periodically to assist management and the Committee in determining the appropriateness of base
salaries, target short-term incentive percentages and long-term incentive compensation of our NEOs. In 2015, the Committee engaged
the Hay Group, which we refer to as the “Consultant,” a nationally known compensation consulting firm, to prepare a report which
presented the Consultant’s assessment of executive compensation for our executive officers relative to a peer group and published
survey compensation data, which we refer to as “the Compensation Study,” to be used in determining 2016 compensation.

In March 2016, the Committee had considered the independence of the Consultant in light of SEC rules and proposed NASDAQ listing
standards and determined that the work of the consultant did not raise any conflicts of interest. The Consultant also determined that its
work for the Committee did not raise any conflicts of interest and confirmed this in a written statement delivered to the Committee.

Targeted Overall Compensation

The 2016 target total direct compensation for each of the NEOs, which we refer to as the “2016 TDC,” consisted of a base salary, short-
term incentive compensation under the Team Incentive Plan and long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards
granted under our 2011 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan. The 2016 TDC was determined by the Committee after consideration of the
Compensation Study prepared by the Consultant.

The Compensation Study recommended a group of comparable telecommunications companies, which we refer to as the “Peer Group,”
to assist in assessing the compensation arrangements of our executive officers. The companies included in this Peer Group were
determined based on a comparison of revenue, number of employees, net income, total assets and market capitalization of various
companies within the telecommunications sector against these same metrics for the Company. The Compensation Committee approved
the following 13 companies as a Peer Group to be used as a benchmark for determining our executive officer compensation
arrangements for 2016:
 

•    Atlantic Tele-Network Inc.   •    Inteliquent, Inc.
•    Boingo Wireless, Inc.   •    Orbcomm, Inc.
•    Cogent Communications   •    Ring Central
•    Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc.   •    Shenandoah Telecommunications
•    Fusion Telecommunications, Inc.   •    SPOK Holdings, Inc.
•    GTT Communications, Inc.   •    8x8, Inc.
•    Incontact, Inc.   

The Peer Group from the updated Compensation Study, in addition to broader compensation surveys provided by the Consultant,
formed the initial basis for the competitive analysis considered by the Committee in making decisions regarding 2016 compensation,
including base salary, short-term incentives and long-term incentive awards for our NEOs and other executive officers. The Committee
generally applies a pay-for-performance philosophy by approving a base salary below the competitive benchmarks and short-term and
long-term incentive compensation at or above the competitive benchmarks to place a greater emphasis on the “at-risk” elements of the
total direct compensation.

The Committee reviews compensation (including new short-term and long-term incentive grants) for each NEO and all other
employees in the first half of each fiscal year. Annual salary rates take into consideration each NEO’s performance for the year and are
designed to result in an adjusted salary that is within an acceptable range of the target established by the Committee based on
competitive benchmarking.

Specifically, the 2016 target base salary for our NEOs was reviewed relative to the benchmark base salary, which was computed with
equal weighting given to (i) the compensation for comparable positions from the Compensation Study, and (ii) the base salary of the
comparable position of the Peer Group, both of which were established at the 50th percentile of the market data and adjusted for
estimated inflation. For our executive officers other than our CEO, the Committee also gave consideration to the CEO’s
recommendation of salary range placements relative to the competitive benchmark based upon attributes such as individual
responsibility and experience. After consideration of the competitive analysis and other factors such as internal pay equity and the
Committee’s pay-for-performance philosophy that strives to link the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders by
placing an emphasis on equity-based compensation, the Committee determined that the base salary for Messrs. Broekhuysen, Anderson
and Ferry and Ms. McDermott should be increased to better align their salaries with the competitive benchmarks. Our NEOs adjusted
base salaries ranged from approximately 1% to 24% below the competitive benchmark salaries. The base salary for Mr. Biltz was not
adjusted after consideration of the competitive analysis.

Thomas E. Ferry(4)   $ 220,500 

 
(1) The annual base salary presented for Mr. Broekhuysen was effective July 1, 2016. Previously his base salary was $301,600.
(2) The annual base salary presented for Mr. Anderson was effective March 1, 2016. Previously his base salary was $200,000.
(3) The annual base salary presented for Ms. McDermott was effective July 1, 2016. Previously her base salary was $219,732.
(4) The annual base salary presented for Mr. Ferry was effective July 1, 2016. Previously his base salary was $210,000.

Annual Short-Term Incentive Compensation

We adopt a TIP on an annual basis, which provides for potential incentive awards. Participation in the TIP is available to all of our
salaried-exempt employees with a hire date prior to October 1 of the applicable year, except those employees who are covered by a
formal sales incentive plan. The TIP award is equal to the product of (i) the individual’s eligible base salary earnings for the year,
(ii) the individual’s targeted short-term incentive percentage up to a maximum percentage provided for in the plan, and (iii) the
Company’s weighted performance achievement percentage, subject to possible adjustment based on individual performance. The TIP
award gives officers the potential to receive a payment on or before March 15 of the succeeding year in the form of cash or stock grants
based on achievement of specified company-wide performance goals established by the Board, which are established at the beginning
of the year under circumstances set forth in the annual short-term incentive plan. The Committee has full discretion to qualify the
annual short-term incentive plan, certify that the performance goals have been achieved, terminate the plan or increase or decrease the
funding available to the plan and elect the payment method if applicable. Additionally, a TIP award may be decreased or an additional
incentive award may be authorized by the Committee in its discretion as necessary to support the Company’s business needs.

The purpose of the TIP is to focus corporate and individual efforts on the accomplishment of specific financial objectives and to
motivate individual participants to achieve or contribute to these objectives. It also serves to assign an at-risk element to each of our
NEO’s total compensation based directly on the achievement of desired results.

Each of our NEOs participated in the 2016 TIP. The Committee determined the 2016 benchmark TIP percentages in March 2016 for
each of our eligible NEOs after taking into account a similar competitive review as to base salary. The Committee determined that the
targeted short-term incentive percentage for Mr. Ferry should be increased from 45% to 70% as of January 15, 2016, the date of his
permanent appointment to Chief Technology Officer to be competitive and appropriately aligned with the objectives of our
compensation philosophy, as this is the rate used for all Senior Vice Presidents and Executive Vice Presidents in 2016. This resulted in
a blended average TIP rate of 69% for Mr. Ferry for 2016. The targeted short-term incentive percentages for Messrs. Broekhuysen and
Anderson and Ms. McDermott were unchanged at 70%.

Table of Contents

Mr. Biltz’s annual short-term incentive percentage was established by our Committee at 100% when he was hired in April 2012 based
on a competitive market analysis and the Company’s compensation philosophy of having a significant percentage of compensation
being “at risk.” The Committee determined not to adjust Mr. Biltz’s short-term incentive after a review and determination that this
“at-risk” component of his compensation was at an appropriate level to provide incentive for performance and also competitive relative
to the Peer Group for retention and pay equity purposes.

The Company also approved an additional incentive opportunity for Mr. Biltz, which is based on the achievement of certain 2016 Chief
Executive Officer objectives in alignment with the Company’s strategic objectives for the year. The Chief Executive Officer’s
additional incentive opportunity provides for a targeted incentive of 50% of base salary payout in addition to the current financial
components of the 2016 TIP targets. The payout percentage for the additional incentive opportunity is at the sole discretion of the
Committee based upon its evaluation of the CEO achievement of stated objectives.

The company weighted performance achievement percentage for the 2016 TIP was based on our consolidated financial results for the
period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and measured and weighted based on the following two financial metrics:
(i) revenue, net of inter-company eliminations, 50% and (ii) net (loss) income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, other expenses/income
(including public offering costs), equity-based compensation charges, acquisition and separation related charges, restructuring-related
charges, and amortization charges related to benefit plan actuarial gains and losses, which is referred to as “Adjusted EBITDA,” 50%.
The Committee established these metrics in March 2016 after considering the focus on these metrics by the investment community in
evaluating Lumos Networks and the appropriateness and significance of maintaining each of these metrics in 2016.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our
financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure commonly used in the communications and
high-speed data transport industry, and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry, to measure operating performance.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a primary financial covenant measure in our senior secured credit facility. Adjusted EBITDA
should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating activities (both of which are determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) or as a measure of liquidity.

The Committee set the performance targets for a 100% payout under the 2016 TIP at the budgeted revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
amounts. The Committee set the maximum TIP payout at 150%, which was believed to be realizable only upon exceptional
outperformance of the business objectives. The Committee also established a “floor” at a 50% payout, with no payout for results below
the established thresholds.

The following table details the minimum, target and maximum levels that had to be achieved by Lumos Networks in order for a 50%,
100% or 150% payout under the 2016 TIP:
 

   Floor    Target    Ceiling  
(Dollars in thousands)   (50% Achieved)   (100% Achieved)   (150% Achieved) 
Performance Factor:       

Revenue (50% Weighting)   $ 205,500   $ 208,000   $ 210,500 
Adjusted EBITDA (50% Weighting)    90,500    93,500    96,500 

In March 2017, the Committee approved a TIP payout of $434,350 to Mr. Biltz, $219,001 to Mr. Broekhuysen, $149,042 to
Mr. Anderson, $151,439 to Mr. Ferry and $159,554 to Ms. McDermott based on a blended weighted achievement percentage of
102.2% of the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA performance targets. The Committee elected to pay these TIP bonuses in the form of
stock grants on March 3, 2017. The number of shares delivered were as follows: 24,539 for Mr. Biltz, 12,372 for Mr. Broekhuysen,
8,420 for Mr. Anderson, 8,555 for Mr. Ferry and 9,014 for Ms. McDermott, which equals the approved dollar amount of the TIP award
divided by the closing price of Lumos Networks Common Stock on March 3, 2017, rounded down to exclude fractional shares. The
stock grants vested immediately upon issuance.

Table of Contents

Additionally, the Committee approved a payout to Mr. Biltz associated with the additional incentive opportunity of $212,500 in
consideration of his achievement of the 2016 CEO objectives. The Committee elected to pay this bonus in the form of stock grants
made on March 3, 2017. The number of shares delivered was 12,005, which equals the approved dollar amount of the bonus divided by
the closing price of Lumos Networks Common Stock on March 3, 2017, rounded down to exclude fractional shares. The stock grants
vested immediately upon issuance.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

Long-term incentive compensation, which we refer to as “LTI,” is granted pursuant to our 2011 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan. Our
Equity and Cash Incentive Plan defines the incentive arrangements for eligible participants and:
 

 
•  authorizes the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock and other incentive

awards, all of which may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals established by the Committee;
 

 •  provides for the enumeration of the business criteria on which an individual’s performance goals are to be based; and
 

 
•  establishes the maximum share grants or awards (or, in the case of incentive awards, the maximum compensation) that can

be paid to a participant in the Equity and Cash Incentive Plan.

In connection with Mr. Biltz’s May 2015 amended and restated employment agreement, he was granted 100,000 shares of restricted
stock with a total grant date fair value of $1,338,000. The restricted shares cliff-vest three years after the grant date. After consideration
of many factors, such as competitiveness of the LTI value in relation to the Peer Group and the additional incentive opportunity
discussed above, the Committee did not grant additional awards to Mr. Biltz in 2016.

In 2015, after consideration of Mr. Broekhuysen’s outstanding equity awards in relation to LTI targets for comparable positions within
the Peer group and among the other executive officers, the Committee approved a grant of restricted stock which has a three year
vesting schedule. In light of this restricted stock award, the Committee did not grant additional awards to Mr. Broekhuysen in 2016.

In January 2016, in consideration of Mr. Ferry’s permanent appointment to Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, and
after evaluation of the total compensation for comparable positions within the Peer group in the updated Compensation Study and the
Chief Executive Officer’s recommendation of stock awards, the Committee granted Mr. Ferry an equity award of 25,000 shares. The
grant date fair value of this award totaled $264,000.

After review of the total compensation for comparable positions from the Compensation Study, the total compensation of the
comparable position of the Peer Group and the Chief Executive Officer’s recommendation of stock awards, the Committee granted the
following equity awards in March 2016: 17,500 shares to Mr. Anderson and 12,000 shares to Ms. McDermott. The grant date fair value
of these awards totaled $228,900 and $156,960, respectively.

These 2016 equity grants further aligned the interests of our executives and those of our stockholders.

Table of Contents

Total Direct Compensation

As illustrated by the following table, a substantial portion of targeted 2016 TDC for our NEOs was “at-risk” (approximately 58% on
weighted-average target levels for our executive officers).
 

 
(1) At-risk incentive compensation in this table includes the target values under the 2016 TIP, which is linked to company

performance objectives, the additional incentive opportunity provided to Mr. Biltz, which is linked to performance of certain 2016
Chief Executive Officer objectives, and the target values of long-term incentive awards granted in 2016, in the form of restricted
stock, which are subject to market risk.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

Our Board approved stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers, which we refer to as the “Stock Ownership Guidelines,” to
emphasize the link between officers and the long-term interests of our stockholders and to enhance our public and investor relations by
openly communicating to investors, market analysts and the public that officer interests are tied directly to our long-term success
through personal capital investment in Lumos Networks Common Stock. The Stock Ownership Guidelines generally require that each
executive own a fair market value of Lumos Networks Common Stock equal to a multiple of the executive’s base salary as determined
by our Board. The guidelines for our NEOs are as follows: five times annual base salary for our Chief Executive Officer, three times
annual base salary for our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and two times annual base salary for our other NEOs. The
guidelines required our NEOs to reach these ownership levels within three years of November 1, 2011, or by October 31, 2014, or, if
later, within three years of being appointed Chief Executive Officer or other named executive officer. All of the NEOs are currently in
compliance with these guidelines.

Table of Contents

Stock Holding Period Guidelines

The terms of the equity awards granted under the long-term incentive plan specify that until such time as the executive has reached his
or her stock ownership guideline, he or she will hold 100% of the shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock received upon lapse of
the restrictions of restricted stock and upon exercise of stock options (net of any shares utilized to pay for tax withholding and the
exercise price of the option).

Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies

Our insider trading policy prohibits all employees and directors from trading in any interest or position relating to the future price of
our stock, such as puts, calls, short sales or any other types of derivatives or hedging transactions relating to the future price of our
stock. Our policy also prohibits employees and directors from holding shares of our stock in a margin account or pledging shares of our
stock as collateral for a loan.

Employment Agreements

We maintain employment agreements with certain of our NEOs. These employment agreements provide that the base salary, TIP
participation and certain other benefits would continue throughout the term of the employment agreements, and the agreements also
contain non-compete provisions, change of control protection and severance arrangements. The specific details regarding each NEO’s
non-compete provisions, change in control protection and severance arrangements are described later in this Compensation Discussion
and Analysis, beginning with the section titled “Change in Control and Severance Arrangements.” Specific terms of the employment
agreements with each of our NEO’s (with the exception of Mr. Ferry who does not have an employment agreement) are as follows:

On May 5, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. Biltz. The employment agreement expires on April 30, 2018 and will automatically renew for successive one-year periods
thereafter unless notice of termination is previously provided. However, if the employment agreement has less than 24 months
remaining upon the occurrence of a “change in control,” as such term is defined in the employment agreement, the employment term is
automatically extended so that the employment term shall not expire until 24 months following the “change in control.” The
employment agreement provides for an initial annual base salary of $425,000 per year and target bonus opportunity of 100% of
Mr. Biltz’s base salary, which will be paid if the bonus criteria, as set by our Board, for the applicable period are met. The agreement
also provided for an equity grant of 100,000 shares of time-based restricted stock.

In connection with his appointment as our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer we entered into an amended and restated
employment agreement with Mr. Broekhuysen, dated as of October 3, 2014, which was amended March 4, 2016. The initial term of the
employment agreement was through December 31, 2015 at which time it was extended for an additional one-year renewal and will
continue to automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is previously provided. However, if the
employment agreement term has less than 24 months remaining upon the occurrence of a “change in control,” as such term is defined
in the employment agreement, the employment term is automatically extended so that the employment term shall not expire until 24
months following the “change in control.” The employment agreement provides for an initial annual base salary of $260,000 per year
and target bonus opportunity of 60% of Mr. Broekhuysen’s base salary, which will be paid if the bonus criteria, as set by our Board, for
the applicable period are met. Under this agreement, Mr. Broekhuysen received an “initial equity” grant effective upon his appointment
of 40,000 shares of restricted stock which vest in full on the third anniversary of his appointment, and an initial equity grant of 100,000
stock options exercisable for shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, which vest 25% for each full year of his continued
employment beginning on the first anniversary of the appointment. In 2015, the Committee approved a target bonus opportunity of
70% of his salary after review of competitive benchmarks and in 2016 Mr. Broekhuysen’s salary was increased to $310,648 after
review of the Compensation Study. In March 2016, the term of Mr. Broekhuysen’s employment agreement was extended through
April 30, 2018. His employment agreement was not otherwise modified.

We entered into an employment agreement with our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Mr. Anderson on August 28, 2012.
The initial term of the employment agreement ended on December 31, 2013 after which time it has been extended through automatic
one-year renewals and will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless notice of termination is previously
provided. However, if the employment agreement term has less than 24 months remaining upon the occurrence of a “change in
control,” as such term is defined in the employment agreement, the employment term is automatically extended so that the employment
term shall not expire until 24 months following the “change in control.” The employment agreement provides for an initial annual base
salary of $154,000 per year and a target bonus opportunity of 45% of Mr. Anderson’s base salary, which will be paid if the bonus
criteria, as set by our Board, for the applicable period are met. Both the base salary and target bonus opportunity percentage are subject
to an annual review by the Committee. Upon his appointment as Senior Vice President – General Manager in 2014, the Committee
approved an annual salary of $200,000 and a target bonus opportunity of 50% of his base salary. In 2015 his target bonus opportunity
was increased to 70% after review of competitive benchmarks effective July 1, 2015 and in 2016 his base salary was increased to
$210,000 after review of the Compensation Study. In March 2016, Mr. Anderson’s employment agreement was amended to provide
that he would receive certain severance benefits in the event the Company sells or otherwise divests its rural local exchange carrier
operations and does not offer Mr. Anderson an employment opportunity generally comparable in rank and benefits to his current
position. His employment agreement was not otherwise modified.

We entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Ms. McDermott
on June 25, 2014. The initial term of the employment agreement ended on December 31, 2015 at which time at which time it was
extended for an additional one-year renewal it will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless notice of
termination is previously provided. However, if the employment agreement term has less than 24 months remaining upon the
occurrence of a “change in control,” as such term is defined in the employment agreement, the employment term is automatically
extended so that the employment term shall not expire until 24 months following the “change in control.” The employment agreement
provides for an initial annual base salary of $219,732 per year and a target bonus opportunity of 50% of Ms. McDermott’s base salary,
which will be paid if the bonus criteria, as set by our Board, for the applicable period are met. Both the base salary and target bonus
opportunity percentage are subject to an annual review by the Committee. In 2015, the Committee approved a target bonus opportunity
of 70% of her salary after review of competitive benchmarks effective July 1, 2015 and in 2016 her base salary was increased to
$226,324 after review of the Compensation Study. Her employment agreement was not otherwise modified.

Qualified Retirement Plan

Lumos Networks offered a qualified pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) to all employees hired before October 1, 2003 to provide an
annual retirement benefit. In connection with a Board-approved cost reduction plan, the Pension Plan was frozen effective
December 31, 2012 and no additional benefits will be accrued by participants for services rendered beyond this date. Mr. Anderson and
Ms. McDermott are the only current NEOs who are active participants in the Pension Plan.

Non-qualified Supplemental Retirement Plan

In addition to the Pension Plan, we provided the Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan, which we refer to as the “SERP,” to
supplement the retirement benefits payable under Lumos Networks’ tax-qualified plans to those key employees selected to participate.
The accumulation of benefits under the SERP was also frozen effective December 31, 2012. The SERP is a non-qualified, unfunded
retirement plan that was provided primarily for the purpose of providing our eligible NEOs with retirement benefits not covered by the
Pension Plan, and for the portion of their salary which is not covered by any other tax-qualified company-funded retirement benefit.
Mary McDermott is the only current NEO eligible for participation in the SERP.

Change of Control Payments

The employment agreements with Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott and the Severance Plan for Mr. Ferry
provide our NEOs with change of control protection as described under “Change of Control and Severance Arrangements” later in this
proxy statement. We believe that by providing NEOs with this change of control protection, it allows our senior management to focus
on maximizing stockholder value and mitigate the necessity for management’s attention to be diverted toward finding new employment
in the event a change of control is proposed.

Severance Arrangements with our NEOs

The employment agreements with Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott and the Severance Plan for Mr. Ferry
provide our NEOs with severance arrangements upon the occurrence of certain events, as described under “Change of Control and
Severance Arrangements” later in this proxy statement. We believe that companies should provide reasonable severance benefits to
employees under appropriate circumstances.

Compensation Recoupment Policy

In order to further align management’s interests with the interests of stockholders and support good governance practices, our Board
approved a Compensation Recoupment Policy. The Compensation Recoupment Policy provides that our Board will have the authority
to obtain reimbursement of any portion of any performance based compensation paid or awarded, whether cash or equity based, where
the payment or award was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results or metrics that are subsequently the subject of a
restatement or correction, from the officers and from other employees responsible for accounting errors resulting in the restatement or
correction.

Perquisites and Other Benefits

The Committee provides certain perquisite benefits to our NEOs. The perquisite offerings are reviewed annually by the Committee and
changes are made, if necessary, to align these benefits with those of our peer group. The Committee conducted its annual review in
February 2016 and determined that the existing perquisite offerings were appropriate after consideration of total compensation value to
our NEOs in relation to our Peer Group.

In addition to the cash and equity compensation discussed above, we provide our NEOs with the same benefit package available to all
of our salaried employees. The package includes:
 

 •  Health and dental insurance (portion of costs);
 

 •  Basic life insurance;
 

 •  Long-term disability insurance; and
 

 •  Participation in Lumos Networks’ Savings and Security Plan (401(k) plan), including company matching contributions.

We also provide each of our NEOs with a vehicle and gas allowance.

Deductibility of Compensation

Under Section 162(m) of the Code, compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid in any one year to a public corporation’s covered
employees who are employed by the corporation at year-end will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes unless the
compensation is considered “qualified performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code (or another exemption is
met). Covered employees include the Chief Executive Officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers as of the
last day of the taxable year other than our Chief Financial Officer. The rules and regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) of the
Code are complicated and subject to change from time to time, sometimes with retroactive effect. There can be no guarantee, therefore,
that amounts potentially subject to the

Table of Contents

Section 162(m) limitations will be treated by the IRS as qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code
and/or deductible by us. A number of requirements must be met under Section 162(m) of the Code in order for particular compensation
to so qualify for the exception such that there can be no assurance that “qualified performance-based” compensation under the 2011
Cash and Equity Incentive Plan will be fully deductible under all circumstances. The Committee addresses this issue when considering
compensation arrangements for the executive officers. However, the Committee also believes that it is important that it have the
flexibility to offer compensation that may not be deductible because of the Section 162(m) cap if deemed necessary to attract and retain
qualified executive officers.

Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation

As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the subsequent rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, we are including a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive
officers. The vote on this proposal will be non-binding on the Board and us and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the
Board or us. This vote will not create or imply any change to our fiduciary duties or create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for
the Board or us. However, the Committee values the opinions that our shareholders express in their votes and will consider the outcome
of the vote when making future decisions on executive compensation, as it deems appropriate.

At the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approximately 97% of the shares cast on the proposal were voted for the non-binding
advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers. In light of that result, the Board implemented
substantially the same objectives, program and rationale for the compensation of our named executive officers in 2016, as disclosed in
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative on pages 139 through 162 in this
proxy statement.

At the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders a large majority of our shareholders approved, on a non-binding basis, the holding of the
non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers on an annual basis. As previously disclosed, the Board and
management determined to implement an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. As a result, we
are including the non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers again in this proxy
statement. See Proposal 2 on page 122 of this proxy statement.

Compensation Committee Report

The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy
statement with management and, based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommends that it be included
in this proxy statement.
 

Submitted by: Compensation Committee

Shawn F. O’Donnell (Chairperson)
Robert E. Guth
William M. Pruellage

The Compensation Committee Report does not constitute solicitation material and shall not be deemed filed or incorporated by
reference into any of our other filings and/or the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically
incorporate this report by reference therein.

Compensation Committee Interlocks

The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Guth, O’Donnell and Pruellage. No member of the Compensation
Committee was an employee of Lumos Networks during the last fiscal year or an officer of Lumos Networks in any prior period. There
are no Compensation Committee interlocks between us and other entities involving our executive officers and members of the Board
who serve as an executive officer or board member of such other entities.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Our Board has adopted a written policy that generally provides that we may enter into a related party transaction only if the Audit
Committee shall approve or ratify such transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy and if the transaction is on
terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third party; the transaction is approved by
the disinterested members of the Board; or the transaction involves compensation approved by our Compensation Committee.

Our Audit Committee Charter provides that management shall report to the Audit Committee any proposed “related party” transaction
that might be considered material to us or the related party, or required to be disclosed by applicable disclosure rules. The Audit
Committee shall be responsible for the review and oversight contemplated by NASDAQ with respect to any such reported transactions.
We have not entered into any material related party transactions during 2016 or the period from that date through the date of this proxy
statement.

On August 6, 2015, we issued $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 8% Notes due 2022, which we refer to as the “8% Notes,”
to Pamplona. Our 8% Notes carry interest expense of approximately $12 million annually. On August 6, 2015, we issued to a Pamplona
entity a warrant to purchase up to 5,500,000 shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock, which we refer to as the “Warrant.” The
Warrant is exercisable on a cashless basis at an initial exercise price of $13.99 per share and may be net-share settled only. Based on
information provided to the Company by Mr. Pruellage, we do not believe that he has a direct or indirect material financial interest in
these transactions.

Table of Contents

During 2016, each of the NEOs participated in our 401(k) plan, which allows eligible employees to tax-defer up to 20% of their
salary through contributions to their 401(k) plan up to the IRS maximum of $18,000 for 2016. In addition, employees age 50 or
older as of the last day of the calendar year are eligible to contribute up to 100% of their salary for the catch up contribution, up to
the IRS maximum of $6,000 for 2016. The tax-deferred 401(k) contributions for the NEOs were the following for 2016: $2,613
for Mr. Ferry, $17,481 for Mr. Biltz, $18,000 each for Messrs. Broekhuysen and Anderson and $20,059 for Ms. McDermott,
including $6,000 in catch-up contributions.

 
(2) The following stock award values pertain to shares granted in 2016: $228,900 for Mr. Anderson, $264,000 for Mr. Ferry and

$156,960 for Ms. McDermott. See the Grant of Plan-Based Awards table below for additional information. These values, as well
as presented prior year values, represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock awards granted during each respective year
computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Share-Based Payments. For a discussion of the assumptions used in determining
the compensation cost associated with the stock awards granted, see note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
the Lumos Networks Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 
(3) The amounts presented in the Stock Award column also column also contain the 2016 annual short-term team incentive plan (or

TIP) bonuses paid by the Company in the form of stock grants on March 3, 2017. The TIP bonus for all of our NEOs was based
on consolidated 2016 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets. The achievement percentage was 102.2% based on actual financial
results for 2016.

The cash value of the 2016 TIP bonuses for the NEOs are as follows: $434,350 for Mr. Biltz, $219,001 for Mr. Broekhuysen,
$149,042 for Mr. Anderson, $151,439 for Mr. Ferry and $159,554 for Ms. McDermott. The Committee elected to make payment
of these TIP bonuses in the form of stock grants made on March 3, 2017. The number of shares delivered were as follows: 24,539
for Mr. Biltz, 12,372 for Mr. Broekhuysen, 8,420 for Mr. Anderson, 8,555 for Mr. Ferry and 9,014 for Ms. McDermott, which
equals the approved dollar amount of the TIP award divided by the closing price of Lumos Networks Common Stock on March 3,
2017, rounded down to exclude fractional shares. The stock grants vested immediately upon issuance.

The cash value of the stock awards is being presented in the Summary Compensation Table as a component of the 2016
compensation of our NEOs because the Compensation Committee considered the bonuses as part of the overall compensation and
the performance targets are based on 2016 financial results. The Company believes this presentation best illustrates the total NEO
compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016. However, similar to stock awards issued under a long- term incentive plan,
the timing and presentation of the compensation amounts in the Summary Compensation Table may differ from the expense
recognition in the Company’s financial statements.

 
(4) The amounts presented in the Stock Award column for Mr. Biltz also contains an additional incentive opportunity bonus paid by

the Company in the form of stock grants of 12,005 shares on March 3, 2017 with a cash value of $212,500. The additional
incentive opportunity bonus was based on the Committee’s evaluation of the CEO’s performance compared to certain CEO
objectives for 2016 designed to align with the Company’s short term strategic objectives. The stock grants vested immediately
upon issuance.

The cash value of the award is being presented in the Summary Compensation Table as a component of the 2016 compensation of
Mr. Biltz as the Committee considered it as part of his overall compensation and the performance targets are based on 2016
objectives. The Company believes this presentation best illustrates the total CEO compensation for the year ended December 31,
2016. However, similar to stock awards issued under a long- term incentive plan, the timing and presentation of the compensation
amounts in the Summary Compensation Table may differ from the expense recognition in the Company’s financial statements.

 
(5) The 2016 value for Mr. Anderson consists entirely of the change in the value of accumulated pension benefits for the qualified

pension plan, based on the earliest date at which there is no early retirement reduction. The 2016 value for Ms. McDermott
additionally consists of the change in value of accumulated pension benefits for the non-qualified pension plan. The remaining
NEOs are not eligible for participation in these plans.

(6) Included in “All Other Compensation” for 2016 are the following elements that exceed $10,000 and perquisites required to be
reported:

 

 
•  automobile allowance offered as a competitive perquisite, which includes a monthly vehicle allowance, gas

reimbursement and personal property tax reimbursement; and
 

 
•  premium payments on external life insurance policies in accordance with each NEO’s employment agreement (for

Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott).

(1) The 2016 TIP plan was measured and weighted based on the following two factors for 2016, as determined by management and

approved by the Committee: (i) revenue, 50% and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA, 50%. The blended weighted performance achievement
based on these factors was 102.2%. After consideration of the 2016 financial results, the Committee approved incentive payments
under the 2016 TIP for our NEOs as follows: $434,350 for Mr. Biltz, $219,001 for Mr. Broekhuysen, $149,042 for Mr. Anderson,
$151,439 for Mr. Ferry and $159,554 for Ms. McDermott. The Committee elected to make payment of these TIP bonuses in the
form of stock grants issued on March 3, 2017. The number of shares delivered were as follows: 24,539 for Mr. Biltz, 12,372 for
Mr. Broekhuysen, 8,420 for Mr. Anderson, 8,555 for Mr. Ferry and 9,014 for Ms. McDermott, which equals the approved dollar
amount of the TIP award divided by the closing price of Lumos Networks Common Stock on March 3, 2017, rounded down to
exclude fractional shares. The stock grants vested immediately upon issuance.

(2) The additional incentive opportunity for Mr. Biltz was determined by the Committee based upon their evaluation of his
performance relating to certain 2016 objectives. After consideration of those 2016 objectives, the Committee approved an
additional incentive payment of $212,500 for Mr. Biltz. The Committee elected to make this payment in the form of stock grants
issued on March 3, 2017 in the amount of 12,005 shares, which equals the approved dollar amount of the award divided by the
closing price of the Company’s stock on March 3, 2017, rounded down to exclude fractional shares. The stock grants vested
immediately upon issuance.

(3) On March 8, 2016, the Committee approved grants of restricted stock awards to Mr. Anderson and Ms. McDermott after
consideration of the Compensation Study performed in 2015, total compensation in relation to that of comparable positions of the
peer group and CEO recommendation. The adjusted closing stock price for Lumos Networks Common Stock on the date of the
grant, which also represents the fair value of the restricted stock awards, was $13.08 per share.

(4) On January 15, 2016, the Committee approved the grant of a restricted stock award to Mr. Ferry in consideration of his permanent
appointment to Chief Technology Officer to adjust total compensation in relation to that of comparable positions of the peer group
and CEO recommendation. The adjusted closing stock price for Lumos Networks Common Stock on the date of the grant, which
also represents the fair value of the restricted stock awards, was $10.56 per share.

(1) We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan, which we refer to as the “Pension Plan,” to provide retirement benefits for eligible

employees that were hired by NTELOS prior to October 1, 2003. Mr. Anderson and Ms. McDermott are the only NEOs who are
active participants in the Pension Plan. Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Ferry are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan
because they were hired after October 1, 2003. The Pension Plan is funded entirely by company contributions and both
Mr. Anderson and Ms. McDermott are fully vested based on their service. The accrued benefit is based on the monthly highest
average compensation over a consecutive five-year period of employment with the Company and the NEO’s years of benefit
service under the Pension Plan. A year of benefit service is a year in which a participant completes at least 1,000 hours of service.
Compensation as defined in this plan includes total compensation from us for the year, increased by any pre-tax contributions
made under the 401(k) plan and /or (Section 125) cafeteria plan. No more than the IRS maximum allowable compensation, or
$265,000 for 2016, is taken into account for Pension Plan purposes. The Pension Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2012
and therefore no further benefits are accrued by participants for services rendered beyond that date.

A NEO may elect early retirement any time after age 55 and the completion of five years of service. As of December 31, 2016,
Ms. McDermott was the only NEO eligible for such early retirement. If the NEO retires on or after an early retirement date, but
prior to the normal retirement date (age 65 and the completion of five years of service), such NEO will be entitled to receive a
monthly benefit commencing on the normal retirement date. If the NEO elects to have the monthly benefit commence prior to his
or her normal retirement date, the monthly benefit will be reduced to reflect the earlier distribution of the benefit.

55    100.00%   63.20%   50.00%   50.00% 

As noted in the above table, if a NEO has completed at least 25 years of benefit service and is at least 62 years of age, there will
be no reduction for early retirement. Also noted in the above table, if the sum of the NEO’s age and years of benefit service equal
85 or more (“Rule of 85”), there will be no reduction in the benefit up to the average (without indexing) of the taxable wage bases
in effect for each calendar year during the 35-year period ending with the last day of the calendar year in which the Participant
attains (or will attain) Social Security retirement age (“Covered Compensation”). For Mr. Anderson, the Pension Benefits Table
above reflects the present value of accumulated benefits at age 58, at which time he will meet the Rule of 85. He can retire on
June 1, 2026 with no reduction in his pension benefit. For Ms. McDermott, the Pension Benefits Table above reflects the present
value of accumulated benefits at age 65, as she will reach age 65 before she meets the Rule of 85. She can retire on February 1,
2020 with no reduction in her pension benefit.

 
(2) In addition to the Pension Plan, the Company also sponsors the SERP to supplement the retirement benefits payable under its

tax-qualified plans to those key employees selected to participate.

At December 31, 2016, the vested SERP Benefit Percentage was 44.0% for Ms. McDermott. If a NEO voluntarily terminates
employment with us, without good reason (as defined in the employment agreements), prior to reaching the normal retirement
date or the Rule of 85, the payout is reduced by 50% to reflect early commencement based on the reasonable actuarial factors and
assumptions employed under the Pension Plan. If a NEO is terminated without cause, if he or she terminates employment for
good reason or if a change of control occurs, each NEO will receive credit for an additional two years of service, which would
result in a SERP Benefit Percentage of 48.0% for Ms. McDermott as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, if a NEO is terminated
without cause, if he or she terminates employment for good reason or if a change of control and a concurrent termination occurs
prior to what would have been the NEO’s normal retirement date, the 50% early commencement reduction shall not be reduced
below the minimum benefit percentage calculated consistent with the methodology employed in the Pension Plan (as set forth in
the SERP plan document). The minimum SERP Benefit Percentage would be 83.0% if Ms. McDermott were terminated without
cause, if she terminated employment for good reason or if a change of control and concurrent termination occurred on
December 31, 2016.

The SERP was frozen effective December 31, 2012 and therefore no further benefits are accrued by participants for services
rendered beyond that date.

(3) The present value of accrued Pension benefits is as of December 31, 2016. For a discussion of the assumptions used in
quantifying the present value of the current accrued benefit, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the
Lumos Networks Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Change of Control and Severance Arrangements

Change of Control Arrangements

The employment agreements we have with Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott and the Severance Plan for
Mr. Ferry provide our NEOs with change of control protection. A “change of control” is defined in each of the NEO’s employment
agreements and the Severance Plan to mean any of the following events:
 

 
•  any person is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of

Lumos Networks securities representing more than fifty-one percent (51%) of the combined voting power of the then
outstanding securities;

 

 

•  consummation of a merger, consolidation or reorganization between us and any other company, or a sale of all or
substantially all of the Lumos Networks assets (a “Transaction”), other than a Transaction that would result in the Lumos
Networks voting securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent either directly or indirectly more
than 51% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of Lumos Networks or such surviving or
purchasing entity;

 

 
•  the Lumos Networks stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation for Lumos Networks and such liquidation is

consummated; or
 

 

•  during any period of 12 consecutive months commencing on November 1, 2011, which we refer to as the “Effective Time,”
(i) the individuals who constituted the Board on the Effective Time, and (ii) any new director who either (A) was elected by
the Board or nominated for election by the Lumos Networks’ stockholders and whose election or nomination was approved
by a vote of more than 50% of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Time, or whose
election or nomination for election was previously so approved or (B) was appointed to the Board pursuant to the

In the event of a change of control and a NEO is still employed by Lumos Networks at such time, the term of each employment
agreement will be extended so that the term will not expire for at least 24 months from the date of the change of control. Upon the
occurrence of a change of control and a NEO remains employed by us and assuming the change of control took place on December 31,

(1) Includes the present value of a SERP lump sum payment, if applicable, inclusive of additional vesting of two years for purposes
of this payment and which does not represent a permanent increase in vesting.

Severance Arrangements

Each NEO’s employment agreement with us provides for severance arrangements upon the occurrence of certain events. Each NEO’s
employment agreement terminates automatically upon his or her death. In addition, we may terminate the NEO’s employment if he or
she becomes disabled. The Company may also terminate the NEO’s employment for any other reason with or without cause (as defined
in the employment agreement). The NEO may terminate his or her employment upon prior written notice of at least 60 days. If the
NEO terminates his or her employment for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement), it will be deemed a termination of
the NEO’s employment without cause by Lumos Networks.

The Severance Plan provides for severance arrangements upon the occurrence of certain events for eligible employees (as defined in
the Severance Plan), including Mr. Ferry. If the NEO’s employment with Lumos Networks is terminated without cause (as defined in
the Severance Plan) and other than by reason of the NEO’s death or disability and the NEO does not meet any of the ineligibility
criteria set forth by the Severance Plan, the NEO is entitled to receive (i) the NEO’s base salary for a period of 12 months, less any
sums required to be deducted or withheld under applicable law, (ii) subsidized rates for the continuation of medical, dental and vision
coverage for the NEO and eligible dependents for a period of 12 months, (iii) with respect to certain officers, including Mr. Ferry, a
lump sum, determined on a net present value basis, equal to the full bonus potential under the TIP for the year of the termination,
(iv) any vested payments payable to the NEO under the TIP that remain unpaid as of the termination date, (v) earned and unpaid base
salary to the date of termination, (vi) unreimbursed business and entertainment expenses and (vii) the employee benefits to which he or
she is entitled pursuant to the applicable employee benefit plans. If the NEO is terminated for cause or upon death or disability, or if the
NEO is otherwise ineligible under the Severance Plan, the NEO is entitled to receive (i) earned and unpaid base salary to the date of
termination, (ii) unreimbursed business and entertainment expenses and (iii) any vested and accrued employee benefits to which he or
she is entitled pursuant to the applicable employee benefit plans.

If the NEO’s employment with Lumos Networks is terminated for any reason, the NEO is entitled under the NEO’s employment
agreement to receive (i) earned and unpaid base salary to the date of termination; (ii) unreimbursed business and entertainment
expenses; and (iii) the employee benefits to which he or she is entitled pursuant to the applicable employee benefit plans. If The NEO’s
employment with Lumos Networks is terminated upon such executive’s

disability, the NEO will be entitled to a pro-rata portion of his/her bonus payments from the TIP for the year of termination. If the NEO
is terminated other than for cause or by reason of death or disability, or if such NEO terminates his or her employment with Lumos
Networks for good reason, the NEO is entitled to receive (i) earned but unpaid bonus payments; (ii) a percentage of his or her base
salary (50% for Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson, 75% for Ms. McDermott) for the termination period (12 months for Messrs.
Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott and 24 months for Mr. Biltz); (iii) a lump sum, determined on a net present value
basis, equal to the full bonus potential under the TIP for the year of the termination (except with respect to Mr. Biltz who is entitled to
receive 200% of his bonus potential under the TIP for the year of termination) and (iv) continued participation in the employee medical
and dental benefit plans for the termination period. To the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, Lumos Networks
will delay termination payments for a period of six months after termination or, if earlier, until the NEO’s death, as necessary to avoid
any excise tax. After such delay expires, all payments which would have otherwise been required to have been made during such delay
period shall be paid to the NEO in one lump sum payment. Thereafter, the percentage of base salary payments will continue for the
remainder of the termination period in such periodic installments as were being paid immediately prior to the termination date. If the
NEO dies while still an employee of Lumos Networks, the NEO’s surviving spouse or, if none, the NEO’s estate is entitled to payment
of any earned and unpaid bonus payments under the TIP for that year, and the death benefits under the Lumos Networks employee
benefit plans will be paid to the NEO’s beneficiaries.

Ms. McDermott and Mr. McCourt’s employment agreements also provide that if the executive is terminated other than for cause or if
the executive officer terminates his or her employment with Lumos Networks for good reason in contemplation of or within one year
following a change in control, the termination period would extend to 24 months. Therefore, in such case, the base salary payment
described in (ii) in the paragraph above would extend for a 24 month period and the TIP bonus described in (iii) in the paragraph above
would be equal to 200% of the bonus potential under the TIP for the year of termination.

In addition, if the NEO is terminated without cause or if he terminates his employment with Lumos Networks for good reason, the
remaining unvested portion of the restricted shares of Lumos Networks Common Stock owned by such NEO will generally vest
proportionately based on the number of full years that have elapsed since the grant date of the restricted shares through the date of
termination.

In the event Lumos Networks terminates the NEO’s employment involuntarily and without cause in contemplation of or within nine
months after a change of control, then the NEO’s stock option and restricted stock awards generally will fully vest and become
exercisable immediately prior to such NEO’s termination date. A NEO’s employment will be considered to have been terminated “in
contemplation of” a change of control only if Lumos Networks makes a public announcement or files a report or proxy statement with
the SEC disclosing a transaction or series of transactions, which, if completed, would constitute a change of control and a NEO’s
employment is terminated by Lumos Networks without cause during the period beginning with such disclosure and ending the earlier
of (x) the date that the Board, acting in good faith, adopts a resolution stating that the transaction or series of transactions will not be
completed or (y) the date that such transaction or series of transactions is completed.

Beginning with the March 1, 2013 grants and those granted thereafter unless the Committee approves additional changes, the awards
vest and become exercisable if the NEO’s employment is terminated involuntarily and without cause in contemplation of a change of
control that occurs within 12 months of the termination and for performance-based awards only if the price per share the shareholders
receive for their Lumos Networks Common Stock in connection with the change in control equals or exceeds the stock price threshold
set forth in the grant agreement. Furthermore, performance-based awards would fully vest and become exercisable in the event the
NEO remains continuously employed with the Company until the change in control and the per share price the shareholders receive for
their Lumos Networks Common Stock in connection with the change in control exceeds the stock price target threshold set forth in the
grant agreement.

If any benefits payable or to be provided under the employment agreements and any other payments from Lumos Networks or any
affiliate would subject the NEO to any excise taxes and penalties imposed on “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code, or any similar tax imposed by state or local law, then such payments or benefits will be reduced (but not below
$0) if, and only to the extent that, such reduction will allow the NEO to receive a greater net after tax amount than the NEO would
receive without such reduction.

As part of Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott’s respective employment agreements and as consideration
for the termination payments described above, during the NEO’s employment with Lumos Networks and for a period of time thereafter
(24 months for Mr. Biltz and 12 months for Messrs. Broekhuysen and Anderson and Ms. McDermott), which we refer to as the
non-competition period, the NEO will (i) not compete, directly or indirectly, with Lumos Networks or Lumos Networks Operating
Company or (ii) solicit certain current and former employees. As consideration for the NEO’s non-competition and non-solicitation
agreement, the NEO will receive an amount equal to a

percentage of his base salary during the non-competition period (or for 24 months, in the case of a termination in connection with or
within one year following a change in control for Ms. McDermott and Mr. McCourt), but only if Lumos Networks has terminated the
NEO without cause or if the NEO has terminated his or her employment for good reason. The applicable percentages are 50% for
Messrs. Biltz, Broekhuysen and Anderson and 25% for Ms. McDermott. If the NEO breaches any of the non-competition or
non-solicitation restrictions, the NEO will not receive any further payments and the NEO will repay any payments previously received.
The agreements also prohibit the NEOs from using any confidential or proprietary information belonging to Lumos Networks at any
time for any reason not connected to their employment with Lumos Networks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ms. McDermott’s
employment agreement is not intended to restrict her right to practice law following the termination of her employment with Lumos
Networks. Mr. Ferry is also generally subject to the same non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions, in addition to an indefinite
non-disparagement covenant, through the Severance Plan, but does not receive any cash consideration for such restrictions in the event
of a termination of employment without cause or for good reason.

The following table shows the estimated payments and benefits for our NEOs under the various termination scenarios discussed above
assuming the triggering event took place on December 31, 2016 and the price per share of Lumos Networks common stock was $15.62
per share, the closing market price as of that date.

PROPOSAL 5 – NON-BINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE
THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

The compensation of our named executive officers is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables
and the accompanying narrative on pages 139 to 162 of this proxy statement.

Our Compensation Committee designs our compensation program for our named executive officers to reward the achievement of our
short-term and long-term objectives. The objective of our compensation program is to attract and retain those employees whose
judgment, abilities and experience will contribute to our continued success. The program is designed to provide overall competitive
pay levels through a mix of base salary, bonus and equity compensation and ownership, create proper incentives to align management’s
incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders and reward superior performance. Our compensation program also reflects
competition and best practices in the marketplace. The mix of compensation components is competitive with that of other companies of
similar size and operational characteristics while also linking compensation to individual and corporate performance and encouraging
stock ownership by senior management.

Based on its review of the total compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2016, the Compensation Committee
believes that the total compensation for each of the named executive officers is reasonable. The Compensation Committee believes our
compensation program effectively achieves the objective of aligning compensation with performance measures that are directly related
to our financial goals and creation of stockholder value without encouraging our named executive officers to take unnecessary or
excessive risks.

The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement and the accompanying tables and narrative provide a
comprehensive review of our named executive officer compensation objectives, program and rationale. We urge you to read this
disclosure before voting on this proposal.

For the reasons stated above and as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are requesting your non-binding
approval of the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the Company’s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as
disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2016 Summary Compensation Table,
the other related tables and accompanying narrative, set forth on pages 139 to 162 of the proxy statement.”

Your vote on this proposal will be non-binding on us and the Board and will not be construed as overruling a decision by us or the
Board. Your vote will not create or imply any change to our fiduciary duties or create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for us or
the Board. However, the Compensation Committee values the opinions that our stockholders express in their votes and will consider
the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions as it deems appropriate.

THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY
PROPOSAL APPROVING THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

AUDIT COMMITTEE

Pursuant to SEC rules for proxy statements, the Audit Committee of the Board has prepared the following Audit Committee
Report. The Audit Committee intends that this report clearly describe our current audit program, including the underlying philosophy
and activities of the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee Report

The primary function of the Audit Committee of the Board is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by
overseeing:
 

 •  our accounting and financial reporting processes;
 

 •  the reliability of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
 

 •  the effective evaluation, analysis and management of our financial risks;
 

 •  legal and tax related matters and our compliance with laws and regulations;
 

 •  the maintenance of an effective and efficient internal audit function; and
 

 
•  the planning, conduct and performance of and the compensation paid for the annual audits of our consolidated financial

statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by an independent registered public
accounting firm.

The Audit Committee operates under a written charter. The Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee shall preserve
open avenues of communication among the external auditors, internal auditors, financial management, senior management, the Audit
Committee and the Board. The Audit Committee has reviewed its charter and determined that the charter adequately and effectively
defines the duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee. Consistent with this function, the Audit Committee encourages
continuous improvement of, and fosters adherence to, our policies, procedures and practices at all levels. The Audit Committee is
accountable and responsible to the full Board.

Composition and Qualifications of Audit Committee

The Audit Committee presently consists of four non-employee directors: Mr. Vaughn (Chairperson), Mr. Aquino, Mr. Robinson and
Mr. Sicoli. Each member of the Audit Committee is independent, financially literate and is free from any relationship that, in the
judgment of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a member of the Audit Committee. The Board
has determined that Messrs. Robinson, Sicoli and Vaughn are each an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined by regulations
promulgated by the SEC. The Audit Committee is, and will continue to be, composed of members that meet the independence,
knowledge and experience requirements set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Standards.

Election and Meetings

The Board annually elects the members of the Audit Committee to serve for a term of one year or other length of term, in the discretion
of the Board, and shall otherwise serve until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each member of the Audit Committee shall
serve at the pleasure and discretion of the Board and may be replaced or removed by the Board at any time and from time to time in its
discretion. The Board shall designate the Chairperson of the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee meets quarterly, or more frequently as circumstances require. The Audit Committee met five times during 2016.
The Audit Committee meets as often as it deems advisable with representatives from our executive management and independent
registered public accounting firm in separate sessions to discuss any matters that the Audit Committee or either of these groups
believes should be discussed. In addition, the Audit Committee or its Chairperson meets with representatives of the independent
registered public accounting firm and our management at least quarterly to review our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents

Responsibilities and Duties

To fulfill its responsibilities and duties, the Audit Committee performed the following for the year ended December 31, 2016:

Documents/Reports Review

1. Reviewed and discussed our annual consolidated financial statements, management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting and all certifications, reports, opinions or reviews rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm.

2. Discussed with our financial management and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, prior to filing
with the SEC, audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and certain other disclosures to be included in our Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that our consolidated
financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

3. Recommended to the Board the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2017. The Audit
Committee evaluates the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm on an annual basis. The Audit Committee
has discussed with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed in
connection with the conduct of the annual audit by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which we refer to as “PCAOB,”
Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees. These discussions included the scope of audit and the independent
registered public accounting firm’s professional responsibilities; the overall audit strategy, timing of the audit and significant risks;
accounting policies and practices, estimates, significant unusual transactions and related parties; the auditors’ evaluation of the quality
of our financial reporting; the auditors’ responsibility for other information containing our audited consolidated financial statements;
difficult or contentious matters for which the auditors consulted; management’s consultation with other accountants; uncorrected and
corrected misstatements identified by the auditors; the completeness and clarity of disclosures in our consolidated financial statements;
and any disagreements with management or other difficulties encountered in performing the audit. In addition, the Audit Committee
has received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP relating to the independence of that firm as required by PCAOB

PROPOSAL 6 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed the firm of KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and
report on our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the year
ending December 31, 2017. We have employed KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm beginning with the
year ended December 31, 2011. It is expected that a representative of KPMG LLP will be present at the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders to answer questions of stockholders and will have the opportunity, if desired, to make a statement.

The following table sets forth the fees billed or expected to be billed to us by KPMG LLP for audit and other services relating to the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Audit Fees

Audit fees generally include fees for services and reimbursement of expenses paid by us to KPMG LLP in connection with the annual
audits of our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as KPMG
LLP’s quarterly reviews of our interim consolidated financial statements during the year. Audit fees further include fees for services
performed by KPMG LLP that are closely related to the audit and in many cases could only be provided by our independent auditors.
Such services include comfort letters and consents related to SEC registration statements and certain reports relating to our regulatory
filings. For the year ended December 31, 2015, fees and reimbursement of expenses for such services included in audit fees above
totaled $90,500. No such fees were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Audit Related Fees

KPMG LLP did not perform any audit-related services for us during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Tax Fees

KPMG LLP did not perform any tax services for us during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

All Other Fees

All other fees relate to an annual subscription to KPMG LLP’s proprietary accounting research tool.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy

The Audit Committee’s policy is that all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by its independent registered public
accounting firm, shall either be approved before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged for the particular
services or shall be rendered pursuant to pre-approval procedures established by the Audit Committee. These services may include
audit services and permissible audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval spending limits for all services to be
performed by the independent registered public accounting firm are established periodically by the Audit Committee, detailed as to the
particular service or category of services to be performed and implemented by our financial officers. The term of any pre-approval is
12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. Any audit or
non-audit service fees that

Table of Contents

we may incur that fall outside the limits pre-approved by the Audit Committee for a particular service or category of services require
separate and specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee prior to the performance of services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees for audit, audit-related and tax and other services. The
Audit Committee may revise the list of pre-approved services from time to time. In all pre-approval instances, the Audit Committee
will consider whether such services are consistent with the SEC rules on auditor independence.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF
THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR
ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017.

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered
public accounting firm retained to audit our consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as our
independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2017. KPMG LLP has served as our independent
registered public accounting firm continuously since 2011. The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations
associated with the annual retention of KPMG LLP. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee
periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. Further, in
conjunction with the required rotation of the auditing firm’s lead audit engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its Chairperson
will continue to be directly involved in the selection of KPMG LLP’s new lead audit engagement partner. The members of the Audit
Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting
firm is in the best interests of us and our stockholders.

Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required but is
being presented as a matter of good corporate practice. Notwithstanding stockholder ratification of the appointment of the independent
registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a new independent registered
public accounting firm if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in our best interests and the best interests of our
stockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment.

OTHER MATTERS

The Board knows of no other matters to be brought before the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if any other matters are
properly brought before the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the persons appointed in the accompanying proxy intend to vote the
shares represented thereby in accordance with their best judgment.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

The cost of the solicitation of proxies on behalf of Lumos Networks will be borne by us. In addition, our directors, officers and other
employees may, without additional compensation except reimbursement for actual expenses, solicit proxies by mail, in person or by
telecommunication. We will reimburse brokers, fiduciaries, custodians and other nominees for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
sending our proxy materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2018 ANNUAL MEETING

In order for proposals of stockholders to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2018 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, such proposals must be received by us at our executive offices at One
Lumos Plaza, P.O. Box 1068, Waynesboro, Virginia 22980, Attention: Secretary or Assistant Secretary, by December 11, 2017.

BENEFICIAL OWNERS

Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, proxy statement and
notice of Annual Meeting to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the
same family. Each stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as “householding,”
reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

If you would like to receive your own set of our annual disclosure documents this year or in future years, follow the instructions
described below. Similarly, if you share an address with another stockholder and together both of you would like to receive only a
single set of our annual disclosure documents, follow these instructions.

If your shares are registered in your own name, please contact us at our executive offices at One Lumos Plaza, P.O. Box 1068,
Waynesboro, Virginia 22980, Attention: Vice President – Investor Relations, to inform us of your request. If a bank, broker or other

ARTICLE 2
THE MERGER

Section 2.01. The Merger.

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the “Merger”) with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the “Surviving Corporation”) and continue its corporate existence under Delaware Law.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall
take place at the offices of Troutman Sanders LLP, 1001 Haxall Point, Richmond, VA 23219 on the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article 9
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree (the date on which the Closing actually occurs, the “Closing Date”); provided, that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), then the Closing shall occur instead on the Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (a) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than two
(2) Business Days’ notice to the Company and (b) the second Business Day following the end of the Marketing Period.

(c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on or prior to the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the “Effective Time”) as the certificate of merger is duly
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises
and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided

amount, the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company
shall remain outstanding, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid, nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted.

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) for
the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the “Certificates”) or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”). At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares; provided, that Parent shall not be required to make available to the Exchange Agent any Merger Consideration for Dissenting
Shares or to the extent that the Company has made available any amounts in accordance with Section 8.03(i). Such funds may be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided, that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder and following any such losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent
for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall only be in short-
term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later
than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of
Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the closing of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest
or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock nine (9) months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to four (4) years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority), any shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificates shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing who is
entitled to, and who has demanded, appraisal for such shares (“Dissenting Shares”) in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law
(“Section 262”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to perfect
or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. Any such holder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective
Time

represented Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal (or had not properly demanded appraisal under Section 262), such shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares,
withdrawals of such demands and other instruments served pursuant to Section 262, and Parent shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
(a) make any payment or commitment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands or (b) waive any failure to perfect
any right to appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262.

Section 2.05. Company Stock Awards.

(a) Stock Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock granted pursuant to
a Company Stock Plan (each, a “Company Stock Option”) (whether or not vested and exercisable at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time) that is then outstanding under the Company Stock Plan shall be treated as follows: (i) where the exercise price per
share under a Company Stock Option is less than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall, automatically and
without any action on behalf of the holder thereof, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of such Company Stock Option
an amount in cash (subject to deduction for any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.07), determined by
multiplying (A) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (B) the
number of shares of Company Stock underlying the outstanding portion of such Company Stock Option had such holder exercised the
outstanding Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) where the exercise price per share under
such Company Stock Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any
payment therefore. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of seven (7) Business Days prior to, and conditional upon the
occurrence of, the Closing, each holder of an outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option, whether or not such Company
Stock Option is then vested and exercisable, shall be entitled to exercise such Company Stock Option in full by providing the Company
with a notice of exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise price in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plan and related award agreement. Each such Company Stock Option that is exercised in accordance with the prior sentence,
shall not be entitled to any payments under this Section 2.05(a), and any shares of Company Stock received upon exercise shall instead
be subject to Section 2.02 hereof.

(b) Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock
Plan which is subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions (“Company Restricted Stock”) that is then-outstanding shall be treated as
follows: (i) each share of Company Restricted Stock that is time-based shall automatically and without any action on behalf of the
holder thereof become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse; and (ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock the vesting
of which is performance-based shall automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof become fully vested and the
restrictions thereon shall lapse.

(c) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Board or the compensation committee of the
Board will adopt such resolutions and take such other reasonable actions as may be reasonably necessary to provide that with respect to
the Company Stock Purchase Plan: (i) participants in the Company Stock Purchase Plan may not alter their payroll deductions from
those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the Company Stock Purchase Plan), (ii) no
participation period will be commenced after the date of this Agreement, and (iii) each right to purchase shares of Company Stock
(each, a “Company Purchase Right”) under the Company Stock Purchase Plan that is outstanding on the date of this Agreement and
remains outstanding after such time shall be treated as follows: such Company Purchase Right shall automatically and without any
action on behalf of the holder thereof, be exercised on the Purchase Date (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase Plan), and (A) if
the Purchase Date is on or before the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms
of the Company Stock Purchase Plan (and such shares shall be treated as other outstanding shares in accordance with this Agreement)
and (B) if the Purchase Date is after the Effective Time, the Company shall pay each holder of such Company Purchase Right an
amount in cash (in lieu of Company Stock) determined by multiplying (x) the Merger Consideration by (y) the number of shares of
Company Stock that would otherwise have been delivered under such Company Purchase Right. Any remaining accumulated but
unused payroll deductions shall be distributed to the relevant participants without interest as soon as administratively practicable
following the Purchase Date and the Company Stock Purchase Plan will terminate at such time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any resolutions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.05 and (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents or make any amendments
to the terms of any outstanding Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock, Company Purchase Right and/or Company Stock
Plan or Company Stock Purchase Plan to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05 and (ii) take all actions as
may be reasonably necessary to terminate all Company Stock Plans and the Company Stock Purchase Plan as of the Effective Time.
All payments under this Section 2.05 shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, pursuant to the Company’s
ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding as set forth below in accordance with Section 2.07.

Section 2.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any
change in the outstanding shares of Company Stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Stock) shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, stock split or combination, any
stock dividend or distribution thereon with a record date during such period, or any other similar transaction, but excluding any change
that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.06 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.01.

Section 2.07. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the
Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
(i) the making of such payment under any provision of Tax law and (ii) the disposition of any Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Stock or Company Purchase Right under this Agreement. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation

shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock, Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company Purchase Right, as the case may be, in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or

the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except to the extent enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(c) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (including any “flex” provisions) related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Other than the Financing Commitments, there
are no other contracts, arrangements, side agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral) related to the aggregate amount
of commitments under the Financing, the availability of the Financing or the conditionality of, or that contain any conditions precedent
to, the funding of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in and expressly contemplated by the Financing Commitments.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement (i) no event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Financing
Commitments and (ii) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 and the performance by the
Company of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions in the Financing
Commitments will fail to be timely satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not be made available to Parent at the
Closing.

(e) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

(f) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.05, the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate
proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitments will be sufficient for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including (i) to pay the Merger Consideration for all of the shares of Company Stock on a fully-diluted basis, (ii) to make all
payments in respect of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Purchase Rights, (iii) to repay or
refinance all Indebtedness of the Company required to be repaid hereunder and (iv) to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement (the “Required Financing Amount”).

Section 5.09. Solvency. Assuming (a) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article 4 and (b) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, or, to the extent permitted by

contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters and the payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Corporation on a consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, “Solvent” when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of
any date of determination, (i) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the
value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities”, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation
of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

has delivered to the Company the duly executed Termination Equity Commitment Letter. The Termination Equity Commitment Letter
is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Sponsor, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors’ rights, general principles of
equity and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Sponsor under the Termination Equity Commitment Letter.

Section 5.11. Interest in Competitors. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary nor any
of their Affiliates own any interest in any Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from products, services or lines of
business within the geographic areas where the Company provides its principal products or services.

written offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during the Notice Period, the
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering the terms of such offer by
Parent, that the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law. If any Superior Proposal that is the subject of clause (i) of this Section 6.03(f) is revised, including any
revision to price, then the Company shall deliver to Parent a new Section 6.03 Notice and again comply with the requirements of clause
(i) of this Section 6.03(f) with respect to such revised Superior Proposal, on each occasion on which a revised Superior Proposal is
submitted, provided, that in connection with each new Section 6.03 Notice contemplated by this sentence, each reference to a four
(4) Business Day period in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a reference to three (3) Business Day notice period (it being
understood and agreed that in no event shall such additional three (3) Business Day notice period be deemed to shorten the initial four
(4) Business Day notice period). If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement proposed by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.03 will be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(g) As used in this Agreement:

(A) “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement (i) in effect on the date hereof or
(ii) that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and which does not prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations hereunder;
provided that such confidentiality agreement need not restrict a Third Party from making directly to the Company or the
Board, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, an Acquisition Proposal.

(B) “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) that was not solicited or received in violation of this
Section 6.03, that is reasonably likely to be consummated and that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), considering such factors as the Board considers to be appropriate
(which shall in any event include the legal, financial, regulatory and fiduciary aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, and the
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal or providing financing for such Acquisition Proposal), to be more favorable from
a financial point of view to the Company stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
offer by Parent, in accordance with Section 6.03(f), to modify the terms hereof).

Section 6.04. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Stock) by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

Transaction Litigation made by Parent or its counsel. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense,
settlement or compromise of any Transaction Litigation (including providing Parent the opportunity to review and comment on

compromise of any Transaction Litigation and consider Parent’s views with respect to any Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected).

the Merger or otherwise limit in any material respect the right of Parent to own or operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets

Proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of
the Merger.

the operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

action to solicit the approval of this Agreement by such stockholders and (ii) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and
the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a proposal to the stockholders of the Company for a

Recommendation and shall include such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and the Board and all committees
thereof shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to

furnish all information (including financial information) as may be reasonably requested by the other that is customarily included in a
proxy statement prepared in connection with a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise required by the

Financing Commitment Amendment, the terms “Debt Commitment Letters”, “Equity Commitment Letters” and “Financing Sources”
shall mean the Debt Commitment Letters, Equity Commitment Letters and Financing Sources, as so amended, supplemented or
modified.

(b) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Financing Commitments, or any portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and
conditions set forth therein (taking into account related “market flex” provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters), Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (i) notify the Company in writing thereof, (ii) use reasonable

Financing Amount (the “Substitute Financing”) and (iii) promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the new commitment letter and fee letter with respect to such Substitute Financing (in a redacted form removing fee
information, economic terms of the “market flex” provisions and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection

Financing, the availability of the Financing or the conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the funding of the
Substitute Financing) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any
commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the “Financing” and any commitment
letter and fee letter for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the “Debt Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement.

event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material
breach or material default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing; (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Sources with respect to any actual or threatened
material breach, material default, withdrawal, early termination or repudiation by any Debt Financing Sources of any provisions of the
Financing Commitments or any definitive document related to the Financing that would, in any such case, reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the timely availability (taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period) or the amount of the Financing
Commitments; (iii) of any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitments or any related fee letters,
(iv) of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Commitments (other than customary
negotiations in the ordinary course between or among any parties to the Financing Commitments with respect to the definitive
documentation for the Financing) and (v) if for any reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in good faith that there is a reasonable
possibility that it will not be able to timely obtain (taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period) all or any portion of the
Financing; provided, that in no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (i) through (v)
above that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or Substitute Financing obtained in accordance with Section
8.03(b)).

(d) Nothing contained elsewhere in this Section 8.03 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be
deemed or construed to require, Parent to pay any fees or agree to pay any interest rate amounts, in either case, in excess of those
contemplated by the Financing Commitments (taking into account any “market flex” provisions with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letters) or to consummate the Debt Financing prior to the completion of the Marketing Period.

of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Termination Equity Commitment Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend for the
remedies and limitations thereon contained in Section 11.04 and Section 11.13 to be construed as integral provisions of this Agreement

under the Financing.

Section 11.13. Specific Performance.

(a) Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 11.13(b), the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable damage
would occur if the Merger were not consummated and the Company’s stockholders and holders of Company Stock Options and
Company Restricted Stock did not receive the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms but subject to the
conditions of this Agreement) and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties’ obligations under Section 8.03 and
the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger and Parent’s obligation to pay, and the Company’s stockholders’ the holders of
Company Stock Options’ and the holders of the Company Restricted Stock’s right to receive, the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to the Merger, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties
further waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or proof of actual damages in connection with any such remedy.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 11.13(a), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parent’s and Merger Subsidiary’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter and to cause Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to occur at the Closing, including by demanding Parent to fully enforce the Sponsor’s obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter and Parent’s rights thereunder, if, and only if, (i) all of the conditions in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 (other than
those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which conditions shall be capable of being
satisfied upon the Closing Date) have been satisfied by, and remain satisfied on, the date the Closing is required to have occurred and
no event shall have occurred nor shall any condition exist that would cause any of the conditions in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 to
fail to be satisfied, (ii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to complete the Closing on the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.01, (iii) the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters has been funded or the Debt Financing
Sources have confirmed that the Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and
(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able for the Closing to occur if specific
performance is granted and that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur.

(c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided herein, subject to the limitation in Section 11.13(b), including objections on the basis
that (i) either party has an adequate remedy at law or equity or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such order or injunction. Until such time as Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee, the remedies available to the Company
pursuant to this Section 11.13 shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate
this Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04(b). The parties hereto further agree that nothing set
forth in this Section 11.13 shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for specific performance under this Section 11.13
prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 10 (and/or receipt of any amounts due pursuant to Section
11.04(b)), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.13 or anything set forth in this
Section 11.13 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 10. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that while the parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent
permitted by this Section 11.13 and the payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee under no circumstances
shall a party be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance to require a party to consummate the Closing
and (B) payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee.

Appendix B

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery
of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts
in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this
section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of
this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary
Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words
“merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or
resulting corporation.”

Table of Contents

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate
of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was
such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with
respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are
available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of
the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal
of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written
demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or
vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a
separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not
voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter
shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a
nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of
this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing
of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will
be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal
rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to
all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days
following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second
notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares
in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is
required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance,
a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is
given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is
given.

Table of Contents

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of
all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who
hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
§ 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining
such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal
an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by

the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by
any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of
stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
550 S. Tryon Street
Charlotte, NC 28288

February 18, 2017

Confidential

Board of Directors
Lumos Networks Corp.
One Lumos Plaza
Waynesboro, VA 22980

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Lumos Networks Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), has asked Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo Securities”) to advise it with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Company Common Stock”), of the Company, other than as specified
below, of the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined) to be received by such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated February 18, 2017 (the “Agreement”) proposed to be entered into among the Company, MTN Infrastructure TopCo, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and MTN Infrastructure BidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Subsidiary”). Pursuant to the Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned

Opinion of UBS Securities LLC
 

  UBS Securities LLC

February 18, 2017

The Board of Directors
Lumos Networks Corp.
One Lumos Plaza
Waynesboro, VA 22980

Dear Members of the Board:

We understand that Lumos Networks Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) is considering a transaction whereby MTN
Infrastructure TopCo, Inc. (“Parent”), a Delaware corporation organized by EQT Infrastructure III SCSp, will effect a merger involving
the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), by and among Parent, the Company and
MTN Infrastructure BidCo, Inc. (“Merger Subsidiary”), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) and as a result of the Merger will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (the “Transaction”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, as a result of the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in the
Agreement) and shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or by Parent immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger (together, the “Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive, for each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock, $18.00 in cash (the “Consideration”), without interest thereon. The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other
than holders of Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Transaction.

UBS Securities LLC (“UBS”) has acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the Transaction and will receive a fee for its services, a portion of which is payable in connection with the
delivery of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In addition, the
Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our
engagement. In the ordinary course of business, UBS and its affiliates may hold or trade, for their own accounts and the accounts of
their customers, securities of the Company and Parent and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.
The issuance of this opinion was approved by an authorized committee of UBS.

Our opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the Transaction or the Agreement, including, without limitation, the
relative merits of the Transaction or any related transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be
available with respect to the Company or the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or any related
transaction. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Company Common Stock as to how such holder should
vote or act with respect to the Transaction or any related transaction. At

your direction, we have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to the terms, other than the Consideration to the extent
expressly specified herein, of the Agreement or any related documents or the structure or form of the Transaction or any related
transaction. In addition, we express no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any
officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Consideration or
otherwise. In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the final executed form of the Agreement will not
differ in any material respect from the draft provided for our review on February 18, 2017, that we have reviewed, (ii) the parties to the
Agreement will comply with all material terms of the Agreement, and (iii) the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the
terms of the Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without any adverse
waiver, modification or amendment of any material term or condition thereof. We also have assumed that all governmental, regulatory
or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any material adverse
effect on the Company, Parent or the Transaction.

In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
relating to the Company; (ii) reviewed certain internal financial information and other data relating to the business and financial
prospects of the Company that were not publicly available, including financial forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of
the Company that you have directed us to utilize for purposes of our analysis; (iii) conducted discussions with members of the senior
management of the Company concerning the business and financial prospects of the Company; (iv) performed a discounted cash flow
analysis of the Company in which we analyzed the future cash flows of the Company using financial forecasts and estimates prepared
by the management of the Company; (v) reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect to certain other
companies we believe to be generally relevant; (vi) compared the financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available
financial terms of certain other transactions we believe to be generally relevant; (vii) reviewed current and historical market prices of
Company Common Stock; (viii) reviewed a draft of the Agreement captioned “Execution Version” provided for our review on
February 18, 2017; and (ix) conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other information,
as we deemed necessary or appropriate. At your request, we contacted third parties to solicit indications of interest in a possible
transaction with the Company and held discussions with certain of these parties prior to the date hereof.

In connection with our review, with your consent, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness in all material respects of the information provided to or reviewed by us for the purpose of this opinion. In addition,
with your consent, we have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts
and estimates referred to above, we have assumed, at your direction, that they have been reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial
performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed with your approval that the financial forecasts and estimates referred to
above will be achieved at the times and in the amounts projected. We have further relied upon and assumed at your direction, without
independent verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows or prospects of the Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or
otherwise, provided to us except for such changes as would not be material to our analysis or opinion, and that there is no information
or any facts that would make any of the information discussed with or reviewed by us incomplete or misleading. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information available to us as of, the
date hereof. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisors, and we express no opinion as to any legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting matters.
