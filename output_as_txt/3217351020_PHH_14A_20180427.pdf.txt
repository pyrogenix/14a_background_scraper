INVITATION TO SPECIAL MEETING

To our Stockholders:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders of PHH Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or "PHH," which will be held on June 11, 2018, at
10:00 a.m., local time, at our offices located at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054. At the special meeting, stockholders will be asked to vote on a proposal to
approve the merger of POMS Corp, or "Merger Sub," a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen Financial Corporation, or "Ocwen," with and into PHH, with PHH surviving the
merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen, which we refer to as the "merger," on the terms and conditions of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
February 27, 2018, which we refer to as the "merger agreement," by and among Ocwen, Merger Sub and the Company, pursuant to which all of PHH's outstanding common
stock will be acquired by Ocwen in an all cash transaction. If the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement is approved and the merger is consummated, you
will be entitled to receive $11.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock owned by you as of the closing date for
the merger, as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement.

        In addition, you will be asked to vote on a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to
the merger and the merger agreement as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the accompanying proxy statement and the other matters described in the
accompanying Notice of Special Meeting.

        Our board of directors, after consideration of a variety of factors, has unanimously determined that the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement is
advisable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Our board of
directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to approve the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the
advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the merger and the merger
agreement, and (3) if necessary or appropriate, "FOR" any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to another date, time or place for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies for the proposals.

YOUR VOTE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES YOU OWN.

        The proposal to approve the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named
executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the merger and the merger agreement must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
common stock present at the special meeting (in person or represented by proxy) and entitled to vote thereon. More information about the merger, the merger agreement, the
advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the merger and the merger agreement, and the special
meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) is contained in the accompanying proxy statement. We encourage you to read the accompanying proxy statement
in its entirety because it describes the terms of the merger, the merger agreement and the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the
merger, as well as provides specific information about the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        If you do not vote on the merger proposal, or do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares for the merger proposal, it will have the
same effect as voting against the merger proposal. With respect to the other proposals, however, if you do not vote or do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how
to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the votes for these proposals.

        In order to ensure that your shares are represented at the special meeting, whether you plan to attend or not, please vote your shares by telephone, electronically
via the Internet or by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card or vote instruction form. If you vote using the enclosed proxy card or vote instruction form,
you must sign, date and mail the proxy card or vote instruction form in the enclosed envelope. If you decide to attend the special meeting and wish to modify your vote,
you may revoke your proxy and vote in person at the special meeting.

        Admission to the special meeting will be by admission ticket only. If you are a stockholder of record and plan to attend the special meeting, retain the top portion of your
proxy card as your admission ticket and bring it and a photo ID with you so that you may gain admission to the special meeting. If your shares are held through a bank, broker or
other nominee, please contact your nominee and request that the nominee obtain an admission ticket for you or provide you with evidence of your share ownership, which will
gain you admission to the special meeting.

        Thank you for your continued interest in PHH Corporation. We look forward to seeing you at the special meeting.

        Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the merger or the merger agreement,
passed upon the merits or fairness of the merger or the merger agreement or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The proxy statement is dated April 27, 2018, and is first being made available to stockholders on or about April 27, 2018.

 Sincerely,

  

 
Robert Crowl

 President and Chief Executive Officer

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING
TO BE HELD ON JUNE 11, 2018

PHH CORPORATION
3000 Leadenhall Road

Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054

To our Stockholders:

        A special meeting of stockholders of PHH Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or the "Company," will be held on June 11, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at our offices
located at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054 for the following purposes:

1. Proposal 1:    To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger of POMS Corp, or "Merger Sub," a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen Financial
Corporation, or "Ocwen," with and into the Company with the Company surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen in an all cash
transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis, which we refer to as the "merger," on the terms and conditions of
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 27, 2018, which we refer to as the "merger agreement," by and among Ocwen, Merger Sub and the
Company, which we refer to as the "Merger Proposal". A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement; 

2. Proposal 2:    To consider and vote upon an advisory (non-binding) resolution concerning the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that
otherwise relates to the merger and the merger agreement as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the accompanying proxy statement, which we
refer to as the "Merger-Related Compensation Proposal"; 

3. Proposal 3:    To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to another date, time or place if necessary
or appropriate for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies for the proposals to be acted upon at the special meeting if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting or any adjournment thereof to approve one or more of the proposals, which we refer to as the "Adjournment Proposal"; and 

4. To consider and vote upon such other business as may properly come before the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        Our board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 3, 2018 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special
meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. Each share of the Company's common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters presented at the special meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

        Our board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement is advisable and in the best interests of
us and our stockholders and has approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

        OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE MERGER PROPOSAL, "FOR" THE MERGER-
RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSAL AND, IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE, "FOR" THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

        Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, which we refer to as the "MGCL," holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to appraisal or
dissenters' rights or rights of objecting stockholders in connection with the merger because our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.



10/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77776/000104746918003269/a2235481zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

        We cannot complete the merger unless our stockholders approve the Merger Proposal, in addition to the satisfaction of the other conditions to closing of the merger.
Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal does not receive the vote required for its approval, then the merger agreement will likely be terminated. The Merger Proposal will not be
approved unless it receives the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock then outstanding and entitled to vote on the proposal. The
Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is only advisory in nature and is not binding on our board of directors or the Company. We, however, intend to review the voting results
with our board of directors and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of our board of directors so that such voting results may be taken into consideration in
connection with our executive compensation decisions in connection with the merger.

        Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we request that you submit your proxy by telephone or via the Internet or complete, sign, date and return
the enclosed proxy prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of common stock will be represented at the special meeting if you are unable to attend.

YOUR VOTE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES YOU OWN.

        If you have Internet access, we encourage you to record your vote via the Internet. The Merger Proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, the failure of any stockholder to vote on the
Merger Proposal will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal by such stockholder. Additionally, if you fail to submit your proxy by telephone or via the
Internet or fail to return your proxy card and you fail to attend the special meeting, your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, voting in person at the special meeting will revoke any previously submitted proxy. If you hold your shares through a bank,
broker or other nominees, you must obtain a legal proxy from such nominee in order to vote in person at the special meeting.

        Please note that space limitations make it necessary to limit attendance at the special meeting only to stockholders as of the record date (or their authorized representatives)
holding evidence of ownership of our common stock. If your shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, please bring to the special meeting your statement evidencing
your beneficial ownership of common stock and valid photo identification. The list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at our
principal executive offices at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054 during ordinary business hours.

BE HELD ON JUNE 11, 2018. THIS NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING AND ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET AT:

SUMMARY TERM SHEET 

        This summary term sheet, together with the question and answer section that follows, highlights selected information contained in this proxy statement and may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the merger, the merger agreement, the advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named
executive officers and the special meeting fully, and for a more complete description of the terms of the merger and the merger agreement, you should carefully read this
entire proxy statement and the documents delivered with and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. (See "Incorporation by Reference.") In this proxy

THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

The Parties to the Merger

PHH Corporation

        PHH Corporation was incorporated in 1953 as a Maryland corporation. For periods between April 30, 1997 and February 1, 2005, we were a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cendant Corporation (now known as Avis Budget Group, Inc.) and its predecessors and provided mortgage banking services, facilitated employee relocations
and provided vehicle fleet management and fuel card services. On February 1, 2005, we began operating as an independent, publicly traded company pursuant to our spin-
off from Cendant. On July 1, 2014, we sold our Fleet Management Services business and began operating as a stand-alone mortgage business.

        Our mortgage business has provided outsourced mortgage banking services to a variety of clients, including financial institutions and real estate brokers throughout
the U.S. and focused on originating, selling, servicing and subservicing residential mortgage loans through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PHH Mortgage Corporation and
its subsidiaries, or collectively, "PHH Mortgage". In March 2016, we announced that management and our board of directors were undertaking a comprehensive review of
all strategic options for our company.

        As a result of the strategic review process, in November 2016, we announced our intentions to exit our Private Label Services origination business, or "PLS
business". We are substantially complete with the wind-down of the PLS business, subject to certain transition support requirements. During 2017, we completed the
delivery of $661 million of Mortgage servicing rights, or "MSRs," and advances under our sale agreements with New Residential Mortgage, LLC, or "New Residential,"
and Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC, or "Lakeview," which are collectively referred to as the "MSR Sale," and pursuant to ordinary course sales to other third parties. As
part of these sales, we increased our subservicing and portfolio retention units through agreements with New Residential. Between August 2017 and December 2017, we
completed the sale of certain assets of PHH Home Loans, LLC, or "PHH Home Loans," to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, LLC, or "GRA," a new joint venture established by
Guaranteed Rate, Inc. and Realogy Holdings Corp., or "Realogy". We purchased Realogy's membership interests at book value on March 19, 2018. As of March 31, 2018,
we have substantially completed the liquidation of the residual assets of PHH Home Loans and the results of our Real Estate channel will be presented as discontinued
operations for our quarter ended March 31, 2018. These strategic actions to date allowed us to progress towards achieving a new business model of operating as a smaller,
less capital-intensive business focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services.

POMS Corp

        POMS Corp, a Maryland corporation, or "Merger Sub," is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen that was formed exclusively for the purpose of executing
the merger agreement and effecting the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Merger Sub has not carried on any activities to date other than those

The Merger Agreement (See page 63 and Annex A)

        On February 27, 2018, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, or "merger agreement," with Ocwen and Merger Sub pursuant to which all of our
outstanding common stock will be acquired by Ocwen in a merger of Merger Sub with and into PHH with PHH surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Ocwen, or the "merger," in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws (See page 63)

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into PHH upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in the merger agreement. As
the surviving corporation, PHH will continue to exist following the merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen; however, shares of PHH common stock will no
longer be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

        The parties have agreed under the merger agreement that, from and after the effective time, the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective
time will become the initial directors of the surviving corporation, until their respective successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.
From and after the effective time, the officers of PHH immediately prior to the effective time will become the initial officers of the surviving corporation, until their
respective successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

        The articles of incorporation of PHH will be amended and restated at the effective time to be in the form of the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the effective time (with necessary changes to reflect the name, date of incorporation, registered office and registered agent of PHH), which will be the
articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation until thereafter

amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law (subject to compliance with requirements in the merger agreement regarding the inclusion of provisions
providing for the exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to PHH's officers, directors and certain other individuals).

        At the effective time, the bylaws of PHH will be amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time, and as so amended and restated will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the articles of
incorporation of the surviving corporation and applicable law.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger (See page 64)

        Unless the parties otherwise agree, the closing of the merger, which we refer to as the "closing," will take place on the third business day following the first date on
which the conditions to closing (described in the section of this proxy statement entitled "—Conditions to the Merger"), other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied only at the closing (but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the closing), have been satisfied or waived.

        The merger will become effective at such time as the articles of merger are filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, or at such later
time as Ocwen and PHH will agree and specify in the articles of merger.

Merger Consideration and Conversion of PHH shares (See page 64)

        At the effective time, each share of PHH common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares owned by Ocwen or Merger
Sub (excluding shares held by Ocwen and Merger Sub in mutual funds and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties), will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 per share in cash, without interest, which we refer to as the "merger consideration," subject to adjustment as
described in the next paragraph.

        If at any time during the period between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, any change in the outstanding shares of PHH common stock occurs
as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend with a record date during such
period, the merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change. In addition, if PHH pays any cash dividend (subject to Ocwen's prior consent)
between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, the merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted such that the aggregate amount of consideration
payable in respect of PHH common stock and equity awards will be reduced by the aggregate amount of such cash dividend.

        At the effective time, each share of PHH common stock owned by Ocwen or Merger Sub (excluding shares held by Ocwen and Merger Sub in mutual funds and the
like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties) will be canceled without payment of any consideration.

Treatment of Equity Awards (See page 66)

        At the effective time, any equity awards of PHH outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be treated as follows:

• Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the
effective time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of $11.00 over

the per share exercise price of the stock option, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Since all of the outstanding stock options
have a per share exercise price greater than $11.00, all of the stock options will be cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment.

• Each time-based restricted stock unit (whether cash settled or stock settled) and each time-based restricted cash unit that tracks the value of a share of our
common stock, in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will accelerate in full and be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unit multiplied by (y) $11.00, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. 

• Each performance-based restricted stock unit (whether cash settled or stock settled) that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will
accelerate in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of our common
stock subject to such unit based on the actual performance through immediately prior to the effective time, as reasonably determined by the compensation
committee of the board of directors of PHH, multiplied by (y) $11.00, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Based on expected
actual performance immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which is based on the assumed stock price of $11.00 and will be determined by
the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of our board of directors, all of the performance-based restricted stock units will be valueless and will be
cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment. 

• Each share of PHH common stock granted under PHH's equity incentive plans that is subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions will
accelerate in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $11.00, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Treatment of Existing Indebtedness (See page 78)

        In connection with the merger, Ocwen will assume, through the surviving corporation, PHH's 7.375% Senior Notes due 2019 and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021, and
either pay off or assume PHH's existing warehouse facilities and advance receivables facility. Prior to the effective time, Ocwen will execute and deliver any supplements,
amendments or other instruments required for the assumption of the senior notes.

Recommendation of our Board of Directors (See page 44)

        Our board of directors, at a special meeting held on February 27, 2018, after due consideration, unanimously (i) determined that the merger on the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement is advisable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders, (ii) approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, and (iii) directed that the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by our stockholders at
a special meeting of stockholders. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal. For a discussion of the
factors considered by our board of directors in reaching its conclusions, see "—Proposal 1—The Approval of the Merger Proposal—Reasons for Recommending the
Merger" on page 40.

February 27, 2018, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Credit Suisse in connection with such opinion. The description of Credit Suisse's opinion set forth in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Credit Suisse's opinion. Credit Suisse's opinion was provided to the board of directors
(in its capacity as such) for its information in connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any
other terms, aspects or implications of the proposed merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might be
available to PHH or the underlying business decision of the board of directors or PHH to proceed with the merger. Credit Suisse's opinion does not constitute
advice or a recommendation to any securityholder as to how such securityholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the proposed merger or otherwise.

• the completion of PHH's exit from its private label solutions business (the exit will be deemed complete for purposes of this condition if there are less than
100 loans remaining that are being originated by PHH and its subsidiaries for their private label solutions clients). As of the date of this proxy statement,
fewer than 10 loans remain that are being originated by PHH and its subsidiaries for their private label solutions clients.

conditions:

PHH Material Adverse Effect (See page 68)

        "PHH material adverse effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development that (i) has a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of PHH and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (excluding those assets, liabilities, businesses and employees that have been or will
be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to or assumed by the applicable purchasers as a result of the PHH Home Loans transactions or the MSR Sale) or (ii) materially
impairs or delays beyond the outside date (as defined below in "—Termination of the Merger Agreement"), or would reasonably be expected to materially impair or
materially delay beyond the outside date, PHH's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Further, a PHH material adverse effect will be deemed to have occurred if PHH's adjusted net worth is more than $47.5 million below a prescribed amount (which
prescribed amount ranges from approximately $393 million to approximately $489 million, depending on the date of measurement) or if PHH fails to maintain a minimum
amount of available cash of a prescribed amount (ranging from approximately $293 million to approximately $367 million, depending on the date of measurement). The
parties have agreed that certain changes in PHH's net worth or cash will be excluded from the determination of adjusted net worth and available cash.

Required Regulatory Approvals (See page 50)

        The consummation of the merger is subject to the filing of all required regulatory notifications, the expiration or termination of any applicable statutory waiting period
under the HSR Act (which termination has already occurred), and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, in each case as such notifications, waiting period and
approvals are specified in the merger agreement. The approvals and notices required to complete the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement include
(a) notices to, and approvals of, various state regulatory agencies of the change in control of PHH or its subsidiaries and (b) notices to, and approvals of, various federal
regulatory agencies and government sponsored entities of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Each party has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate the merger as soon as practicable. In addition, Ocwen has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to
be done) all things that any governmental authority indicates would be required in order to obtain any required governmental approvals or avoid any injunction or law that
would enjoin, prevent or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However, Ocwen is not required to, and PHH may not,
take any action or commit

to take any action or agree to any restraint, restriction, limitation, term, requirement, provision or condition that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to, impair in any material respect the business or financial condition of Ocwen and its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries), taken
as a whole (we refer to each such restraint, restriction, limitation, term, requirement, provision or condition as a "burdensome condition"). In addition, neither party is
required to commence any litigation with any governmental authority to oppose any enforcement action by any governmental authority or remove any regulatory orders
impeding the parties' ability to consummate the merger.

No Solicitation by PHH (See page 75)

        PHH has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions described below, it will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and its or their respective
officers, directors, employees and representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing information) any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing)
with respect to, or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in, any "takeover proposal" (as such term is defined in "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation by PHH" on page 75); 

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish any information or cooperate in any way with any person with respect
to, any takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a takeover proposal; 

• approve or recommend any takeover proposal; 

• approve, recommend, execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share
purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal (each such letter, memorandum or
agreement is referred to as an "acquisition agreement"); 

• enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring PHH to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or breach its obligations thereunder; or 

• propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        However, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal that did not result
from any material breach of the non-solicitation restrictions described above and certain other provisions of the merger agreement, PHH may (i) contact the person making
such takeover proposal to clarify the terms and conditions of the takeover proposal and (ii) if our board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors, that such takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a "superior proposal" (as such term is defined in "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation by PHH" on page 75), PHH may:

• furnish information with respect to PHH and its subsidiaries to the person or group of persons who has made such takeover proposal pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement that contains (x) confidentiality terms that are, as determined by PHH in good faith, no less favorable in the aggregate to PHH
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with Ocwen and (y) a customary standstill provision, as long as any material non-public information
furnished to such person or group has previously been provided to Ocwen or is provided to Ocwen substantially concurrently with the provision of such
information to such person or group; and 

• participate in discussions regarding the terms of such takeover proposal and the negotiation of such terms with the person making such takeover proposal.

Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Termination (See page 76)

        PHH has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions as described below, neither our board of directors nor any committee thereof will (i) withdraw or propose to
withdraw (or modify or propose to modify in any manner adverse to Ocwen) our board of directors' recommendation of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby to PHH's stockholders, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any takeover
proposal, (iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow PHH or any of its subsidiaries to execute or
enter into, any acquisition agreement, (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle requiring PHH to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or breach its obligations thereunder, (v) fail to recommend against any takeover proposal subject to federal tender
offer rules in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within 10 business days after the commencement of such takeover proposal, (vi) fail to include
our board of directors' recommendation of the merger agreement in this proxy statement or re-affirm such recommendation within 10 business days following Ocwen's
written request (provided that Ocwen may not make such request more than twice in connection with any takeover proposal), or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the
actions in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) (we refer to any of the foregoing actions as an "adverse recommendation change").

        Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, our board of directors may, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal that did not result from any material breach of the non-solicitation restrictions described above under "—No Solicitation by
PHH" and compliance with certain other provisions of the merger agreement as described under "The Merger Agreement—Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary
Termination" on page 76, make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to such
takeover proposal if our board of directors has determined, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such takeover proposal constitutes a superior
proposal and that, following consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement is
reasonably likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to PHH's stockholders under applicable law.

        In addition, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, subject to compliance with certain other provisions of the merger agreement as
described under "The Merger Agreement—Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Termination" on page 76, our board of directors may make an adverse
recommendation change in response to an "intervening event" (as defined below) if our board of directors determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
failure to make an adverse recommendation change is reasonably likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to PHH's stockholders under applicable law. For
purposes of the merger agreement, an "intervening event" refers to any material development or change in circumstances relating to PHH or any of its subsidiaries
occurring or arising after the date of the merger agreement that (i) was not known by nor reasonably foreseeable to our board of directors as of the date of the merger
agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any takeover proposal; provided, however, that in no event will any of the following be deemed, either alone or in
combination, to constitute an interviewing event: (1) changes in the market price or trading volume of PHH common stock, in and of themselves, (2) the timing of any
required governmental approval, (3) the dismissal or any other resolution of the CFPB litigation (as defined below under "—CFPB Litigation") or (4) the fact that, in and
of itself, PHH exceeds internal or published projections.

        PHH will be required to pay a termination fee of $12,600,000 to Ocwen if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, as described under "—
Termination Fee" below.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See page 82)

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time (notwithstanding any stockholder approval) in the
following circumstances:

• by mutual written consent of Ocwen and PHH; 

• by either Ocwen or PHH if: 

• the merger has not been consummated on or before September 27, 2018, which we refer to as the "outside date," provided that the outside date will
be extended to December 27, 2018 if the closing condition relating to the receipt of the required governmental approvals has not been satisfied on
September 27, 2018 but all other conditions described under "—Conditions to the Merger" have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, capable of being satisfied on such date); provided, further, that this right to terminate the merger
agreement will not be available to a party that has breached the merger agreement and such breach was the primary cause of or resulted in the
failure to consummate the merger by the outside date; 

• any permanent injunction prohibiting the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has become effective, final and
nonappealable, or any law prohibiting the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has been enacted, promulgated
or enforced by any governmental authority; provided, that the terminating party has complied in all material respects with its obligations described
under "—Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approvals"; or 

• the vote required to adopt the merger agreement is not obtained at the special meeting of PHH stockholders.

        PHH will be required to pay a termination fee of $12,600,000 to Ocwen if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, as described under "—
Termination Fee" below.

        In addition, PHH may terminate the merger agreement in the following circumstances:

• prior to the approval of the merger agreement by PHH's stockholders, in order to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a superior
proposal; provided that PHH has complied in all material respects with its obligations described under "—No Solicitation by PHH" and certain procedures
described under "—Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Termination" above, and concurrently pays the termination fee to Ocwen as described
under "—Termination Fee" below; or 

• there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement by Ocwen or Merger Sub, which breach
would give rise to the failure to satisfy a condition to PHH's obligation to consummate the merger, and such failure is not curable or has not been cured
within the earlier of the outside date and 30 days following PHH's written notice to Ocwen of such breach; provided that PHH will not have this right to
terminate the merger agreement if PHH is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement that would give
rise to the failure to satisfy a condition to Ocwen's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the merger.

        In addition, Ocwen may terminate the merger agreement in the following circumstances:

• prior to the approval of the merger agreement by PHH's stockholders, our board of directors has made an adverse recommendation change; or 

• there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement by PHH, which breach would give rise to
the failure to satisfy a condition to

Ocwen's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the merger, and such failure is not curable or has not been cured within the earlier of the outside date
and 30 days following Ocwen's written notice to PHH of such breach; provided that Ocwen will not have this right to terminate the merger agreement if
Ocwen is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement that would give rise to the failure to satisfy a
condition to PHH's obligation to consummate the merger.

        If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party to another party; provided, however, that
(i) certain provisions, including those relating to confidentiality, termination fee, governing law and jurisdiction will survive the termination and (ii) no party will be
released from liabilities arising out of any willful breach of the merger agreement or fraud.

Termination Fee (See page 82)

        PHH will be required to pay a termination fee of $12,600,000 to Ocwen under the following circumstances:

• Ocwen terminates the merger agreement as a result of an adverse recommendation change by our board of directors at any time prior to the approval of the
merger by our stockholders; 

• PHH terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal at any time prior to the
approval of the merger by our stockholders; or 

• (i) a third party has publicly announced and not withdrawn a takeover proposal prior to the special meeting of PHH's stockholders to vote on the adoption
of the merger agreement or the termination of the merger agreement, (ii) PHH or Ocwen terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the
required PHH stockholder approval of the merger agreement or the failure to consummate the merger on or before the outside date, or Ocwen terminates
the merger agreement due to a material breach by PHH, and (iii) within 12 months of such termination, PHH consummates a takeover proposal or enters
into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a takeover proposal that is subsequently consummated; or 

• PHH or Ocwen terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the required PHH stockholder approval of the merger agreement but, at the
time of such termination, Ocwen would also have been permitted to terminate the merger agreement as a result of an adverse recommendation change by
our board of directors.

        In the event the termination fee is payable, from and after the payment of the termination fee by PHH to Ocwen, PHH will have no further liability of any kind.

Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (See page 51)

        The receipt of cash for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of
cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for such U.S. Holder's shares of PHH common stock in the merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount
measured by the difference between the cash such U.S. Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of PHH common stock
surrendered in the merger. A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the
Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. You are encouraged to read the discussion under "—Certain Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger—U.S. Holders" beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement and to consult with your own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income
tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your particular circumstances and

any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction or other tax laws.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers (See Page 54)

        In considering the recommendation of our board of directors that you vote to approve the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that aside from their interests as
stockholders of PHH, certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the holders of
our common stock. The members of our board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger
agreement and the merger, and in recommending to our stockholders that the Merger Proposal be approved. These interests include the following:

• certain of our directors and executive officers hold outstanding stock options, restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock that will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in excess of any per share exercise price and without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding taxes; 

• certain of our executive officers are parties to arrangements with us that provide for severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of
employment in connection with the merger; 

• certain of our executive officers are entitled to be paid cash incentive bonuses under the PHH 2018 Management Incentive Plan and the 2018 cash
performance incentive awards in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with the merger; 

• certain of our executive officers are entitled to cash retention awards in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with the
merger; and 

• the merger agreement provides for continued indemnification and directors' and officers' liability insurance to be provided by us as the surviving
corporation.

        For more information, see "Proposal 1—The Approval of the Merger Proposal—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers" beginning on page 54 of this proxy
statement.

No Dissenters' Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders (See Page 27 and Page 53)

        Holders of our common stock are not entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the
merger under our charter and Maryland General Corporation Law, or the "MGCL. Subject to the limited circumstances set forth in Section 3-202(d) of the MGCL, the
MGCL does not provide for appraisal rights or other similar rights to stockholders of a corporation in connection with a merger of a corporation if the shares of the
corporation are listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on the transaction. The circumstances of the merger do not satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 3-202(d) of the MGCL that would trigger such appraisal rights or similar rights.

Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Consummated (See Page 54)

        If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment
for their shares of PHH common stock. Instead, PHH will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered
under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, PHH may
be required to pay Ocwen a termination fee, as described under "—The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee" beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.

        Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be consummated, it is likely that the
price of our common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it
trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Place (See page 25)

        The special meeting will take place on Monday, June 11, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at our offices located at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey
08054. See "—The Special Meeting—Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting."

Purpose (See page 25)

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon: (1) the Merger Proposal; (2) the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal, (3) the Adjournment
Proposal, and (4) such other business as may properly come before the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. See "—The Special Meeting—Date,
Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting."

Record Date and Voting Securities (See page 25)

        You are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, if you are a holder of record of our common stock as of
the close of business on April 3, 2018, the record date for the special meeting. You will have one vote for each share of our common stock that you owned on the record
date. As of the record date, there were 32,557,494 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting.
See "—The Special Meeting—Record Date."

Quorum; Vote Required (See page 25)

        Under Section 1.05 of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, a quorum consisting of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting must be
represented in person or by proxy for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Pursuant to Article EIGHTH, paragraph (a)(4) of our Articles of Amendment and
Restatement and as permitted by Section 2-104(b)(5) of the MGCL, the approval of the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter, notwithstanding the
requirements of Section 3-105(e) of the MGCL otherwise requiring authorization by a greater proportion for that purpose. Under Section 1.05 of our Amended and
Restated Bylaws, the approval of the advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-
K and any adjournment of the special meeting each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at a special meeting at which a quorum is
present. See "—The Special Meeting—Quorum; Vote Required."

Voting by, and Revocation of, Proxy (See page 26)

        Our board of directors has selected Robert Crowl, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan Melcher, our Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and
Corporate Secretary, to serve as proxies at the special meeting. The shares of common stock represented by each proxy authorized by telephone, electronically via the
Internet and completed and returned proxy card will be voted in accordance with the directions indicated. If you submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, or sign
and return your proxy card by mail, without indicating your vote, your shares will be voted "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal, and, if necessary or appropriate,

"FOR" the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name" or through a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not provide instructions as to how your
shares are to be voted on "non-routine" matters, however, your bank, broker or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on your behalf and your shares will be
reported as "broker non-votes." The proxy also confers discretionary authority to vote the shares authorized to be voted thereby on any matter that properly may be
presented for action at the special meeting. We know of no other business to be presented at the special meeting, and no other matters properly may be presented for a vote
at the special meeting. See "—The Special Meeting—Other Business."

        Any proxy given may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. Proxies may be revoked by submitting a new proxy
bearing a later date to our corporate secretary (including a proxy authorization submitted by telephone or electronically through the Internet prior to the deadline for voting
by telephone or the Internet), by delivering a written notice of revocation to our corporate secretary bearing a later date than the date of your proxy card, or by attending
the special meeting and voting in person. If you have shares held in "street name" or by a bank, broker or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting a later
dated voting instruction form to your bank, broker or other nominee, or if you obtained a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote
your shares, by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Your attendance at the special meeting, however, will not, by itself, revoke your proxy or otherwise
vote your shares.

        You can vote your shares by telephone, electronically via the Internet or by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card. If you vote using the enclosed proxy
card, you must sign, date and mail the proxy card in the enclosed envelope.

        For the Merger Proposal, you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. The Merger Proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, if you abstain, it will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal; although, votes cast as abstentions will be considered present for the special meeting and for purposes of determining
the presence of a quorum. For the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal, you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or
ABSTAIN. The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require the approval of the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
such proposal at a special meeting at which a quorum is present. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will also be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, but will not be counted as votes cast on these proposals and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote
for each of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. See "—The Special Meeting—Proxies and Revocation."

MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDENDS (See Page 89)

        Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "PHH." On February 26, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of
the merger agreement, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $8.84 per share. On April 26, 2018, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of
this proxy statement, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $10.68 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common
stock in connection with voting your shares.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK

        If the merger is consummated, following the effective time, our common stock will cease trading on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. As
such, we would no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting, the merger, the advisory (non-
binding) resolution concerning the compensation of our named executive officers and the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. These questions and
answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a PHH stockholder. Please refer to the "Summary Term Sheet" and the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement which you should read carefully.

Q. Why am I receiving these proxy materials? 

A. On February 27, 2018, PHH entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ocwen and Merger Sub pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with
and into PHH with PHH surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen. As a result of the merger, all of the outstanding common stock
of PHH will be acquired by Ocwen in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis. The board of
directors of PHH is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of PHH common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be
voted at a special meeting of stockholders with respect to (1) the proposal to approve the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, (2) the
proposal to approve an advisory (non-binding) resolution concerning the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the
merger and the merger agreement, and, if necessary or appropriate, and (3) the proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to
another date, time or place if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies for the proposals to be acted upon at the special meeting if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment thereof to approve one or more of the proposals. 

Q. When and where is the special meeting going to be held? 

A. The special meeting will be held at our offices located at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, on Monday, June 11, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., local time.
Registration and seating will begin at 9:00 a.m., local time. 

Q. What is the proposed transaction? 

A. The proposed transaction is PHH's acquisition by Ocwen through the merger of Merger Sub with and into PHH upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, set
forth in the merger agreement, with PHH as the surviving corporation. As the surviving corporation, PHH will continue to exist following the merger as a direct,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen. However, shares of PHH common stock will no longer be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Q. What will I receive for my shares of PHH common stock if the merger is consummated? 

A. At the effective time of the merger, each share of PHH common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares owned by
Ocwen or Merger Sub (excluding shares held by Ocwen and Merger Sub in mutual funds and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties), will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 per share in cash, without interest. 

If you are a stockholder of record, you will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration until you have surrendered your stock certificates (or followed the
procedures applicable to lost stock certificates) or transferred your uncertificated shares to the paying agent along with a duly executed letter of transmittal.

Table of Contents

Q. What will happen to my shares of common stock after completion of the merger? 

A. Following the consummation of the merger, your shares of our common stock will be canceled and will represent only the right to receive your portion of the
merger consideration. At or promptly after the effective time, Ocwen will deposit with a paying agent selected by Ocwen (subject to the consent of PHH), which
we refer to as the "paying agent," cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration payable to holders of our common stock in accordance
with the merger agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the paying agent will mail to each holder of shares of our common stock a
letter of transmittal in customary form and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder's certificated or uncertificated shares in exchange for
payment of the merger consideration. 

Q. Which stockholders may vote? 

A. Our board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 3, 2018 as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the special
meeting, and to vote their shares at the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. Only stockholders of record at the close of
business on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. Each share
of our common stock is entitled to one vote. 

At the close of business on the record date, the Company had 32,557,494 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

Q. What am I being asked to vote on? 

A. Our board of directors is asking the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on April 3, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, to consider
and vote upon: (1) a proposal to approve the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; (2) the advisory (non-binding) resolution concerning the
compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the merger and the merger agreement as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in this proxy statement, (3) the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to another date, time or place, if necessary or appropriate, for
the purpose of soliciting additional proxies for the proposals to be acted upon at the special meeting if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting
or any adjournment thereof to approve one or more of the proposals, and (4) such other business as may properly come before the special meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof. Our board of directors currently knows of no other business that will be presented for consideration at the special meeting.
In the event any matters other than those referred to in the accompanying Notice of Meeting and this proxy statement should properly come before and be
considered at the special meeting, it is intended that proxies in the form the Company provides to its stockholders will be voted thereon in accordance with the
judgment of the person or persons voting such proxies. 

Q. What are the board of directors' recommendations for how I should vote my shares? 

A. Our board of directors recommends that you vote your shares as follows: 

• Proposal 1:  FOR the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; 

• Proposal 2:  FOR the advisory (non-binding) resolution concerning the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to
the merger and the merger agreement; and 

• Proposal 3:  FOR the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to another date, time or place, if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies for the

Table of Contents

proposals to be acted upon at the special meeting if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment thereof to approve one
or more of the proposals.

Q. Why is the Company seeking a stockholder vote on the Adjournment Proposal? 

A. Adjourning the special meeting to a later date will give us additional time to solicit proxies to vote in favor of approval of the Merger Proposal and/or the Merger-
Related Compensation Proposal if there are not sufficient votes in favor of any of these proposals. Consequently, we are seeking your approval of the Adjournment
Proposal to ensure that, if necessary, we will have enough time to solicit the required votes for approval of the Merger Proposal and/or the Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal. 

Q. Who can attend the special meeting? 

A. Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 3, 2018, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the special meeting. Stockholders will be
asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Please note that, if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a bank,
broker or other nominee), you must bring either a copy of the vote instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or a copy of a brokerage
statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date. 

Cameras and video recording devices will not be permitted at the special meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for
examination by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the special meeting beginning ten days prior to the special meeting during ordinary business hours at
3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054, our principal place of business, and ending on the date of the special meeting.

Q. Do I need an admission ticket to attend the special meeting? 

A. Yes. Attendance at the special meeting will be limited to stockholders of record as of the record date, their authorized representatives and our guests. Admission
will be by admission ticket only. For registered stockholders, the top portion of the proxy card enclosed with the proxy statement will serve as an admission ticket.
If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in "street name," or through an intermediary, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, you should request an
admission ticket from your bank, broker or other nominee or send a request in writing to PHH Corporation, Attention: Investor Relations, 3000 Leadenhall Road,
Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054, and include proof of ownership of our common stock, such as a bank or brokerage firm account statement or letter from the bank,
broker or other nominee holding your stock confirming your beneficial ownership. Stockholders who do not obtain admission tickets in advance of the special
meeting may obtain them on the date of the special meeting at the registration desk upon verifying their stock ownership as of the record date. In accordance with
our security procedures, all persons attending the special meeting must present picture identification along with their admission ticket or proof of beneficial
ownership in order to gain admission to the special meeting. Admission to the special meeting will be expedited if admission tickets are obtained in advance.
Admission tickets may be issued to others at our discretion. 

Q. How many votes must be present at the special meeting to constitute a quorum? 

A. Stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote as of the record date, April 3, 2018, must be present, in
person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 32,557,494 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.
Shares represented by abstentions on any proposal to be

Table of Contents

acted upon by stockholders at the special meeting will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.

Q. How many votes can be cast by all stockholders? 

A. Up to 32,557,494 votes may be cast at the special meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to cast one vote for each share of common stock held by such stockholder
as of the record date. 

Q. What vote is needed for each of the proposals to be adopted? 

A. Pursuant to our charter and as permitted by Maryland law, the approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total
number of shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter, notwithstanding the requirements of Section 3-105(e) of the MGCL
otherwise requiring authorization by a greater proportion for that purpose. 

Under Section 1.05 of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the approval of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at a special meeting at which a quorum is present.

Q What is a broker non-vote? 

A. Generally, a broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal
because (i) the nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and (ii) the nominee lacks discretionary voting power to vote such shares.
Under the rules of the NYSE, a nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to "non- routine" matters. 

"Non-routine" matters under the NYSE's rules include director elections, whether contested or uncontested, extraordinary transactions, such as the merger, and
votes concerning executive compensation and certain corporate governance proposals. As a result, your bank, broker or other nominee may only vote your shares
on "non-routine" matters if you have provided your bank, broker or other nominee with specific voting instructions.

Thus, if your shares are held in "street name" and you do not provide instructions as to how your shares are to be voted on "non-routine" matters, your bank, broker
or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on your behalf. For matters that are still considered "routine" under the NYSE's rules (e.g., ratification of
auditors), your bank, broker or other nominee may continue to exercise discretionary voting authority and may vote your shares on your behalf for such routine
matters even if you fail to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with specific voting instructions as to how you would like your shares voted on such routine
matters. None of the proposals anticipated to be presented at the special meeting are expected to be "routine".

We urge you to provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee so that your votes may be present for purposes of establishing a quorum and counted for
each proposal to be voted upon. You should vote your shares by following the instructions provided on the vote instruction form that you receive from your bank,
broker or other nominee.

Q. What should I do now? How do I vote? 

A. We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, including the merger agreement, and the documents we include by reference
and refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares that you
hold. You can vote in person or by valid proxy received by telephone, via the Internet or by mail.

We urge you to vote by doing one of the following:

The deadline for voting by telephone or electronically through the Internet is 11:59 p.m. EDT on June 10, 2018.

Q. Can I change my vote? 

A. Yes. A proxy may be revoked at any time prior to the voting at the special meeting by submitting a later dated proxy (including a proxy authorization submitted by
telephone or electronically through the Internet prior to the deadline for voting by telephone or the Internet), by giving timely written notice of such revocation to
our Corporate Secretary in advance of the special meeting or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. If you have shares held by a bank, broker or
other nominee or in "street name," you may change your vote by submitting a later dated voting instruction form to your bank, broker or other nominee, or if you
obtained a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the special meeting and voting in person. 

Q. Could other matters be decided at the special meeting? 

A. Our board of directors does not intend to bring any matter before the special meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. If any other matters
properly come before the special meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy card, or their duly appointed substitutes acting at the special meeting, will be
authorized to vote or otherwise act in respect of any such matters in their discretion. 

Q. What if I vote for some but not all of the proposals? 

A. Shares of our common stock represented by proxies received by us (whether received through the return of the enclosed proxy card or received via telephone or the
Internet) where the stockholder has provided voting instructions with respect to the proposals described in this proxy statement, including the Merger Proposal, the
Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, will be voted in accordance with the voting instructions so made. If your proxy card is
properly executed and returned but does not contain voting instructions as to one or more of the proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting, or if you give
your proxy by telephone or via

the Internet without indicating how you want to vote on each of the proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting, then your shares will be voted for such
proposals as follows:

• Proposal 1:  FOR the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement; 

• Proposal 2:  FOR the advisory (non-binding) resolution concerning the compensation of our named executive officers related to the merger and the merger
agreement; and 

• Proposal 3:  FOR the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to another date, time or place if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies for the proposals to be acted upon at the special meeting if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting or any
adjournment thereof to approve one or more of the proposals. 

If your shares are held in street name and you do not properly instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares, your bank, broker or
other nominee may either use its discretion to vote your shares on matters deemed "routine" by the NYSE or may not vote your shares. For any matters
deemed "non-routine" by the NYSE, your bank, broker or other nominee would not be able to vote your shares on such matters. We encourage you to
provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by carefully following the instructions provided to ensure that your shares are voted at the
special meeting in accordance with your desires.

Q. Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 

A. We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies on behalf of our board of directors. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf without
compensation in person or by telephone, facsimile or electronically through the Internet, as described above. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to solicit
proxies in connection with the special meeting. We have also engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxies. We will
reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending our proxy materials to beneficial owners of our
common stock as of the record date. 

Q. Who will count and certify the vote? 

A. Representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will count the votes and certify the voting results. The voting results are expected to be published in a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the conclusion of the special meeting. 

Q. How can I access the proxy materials electronically?

Q. Should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A. No. As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the paying agent will mail to each holder of shares of our common stock a letter of transmittal in
customary form and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder's certificated or uncertificated shares in exchange for payment of the merger
consideration. If you are a stockholder of record, you will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration until you have surrendered your stock certificates (or
followed the procedures applicable to lost stock certificates) or transferred your uncertificated shares to the paying agent along with a duly executed letter of
transmittal. PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. 

Q: I do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the merger consideration for my shares? 

A: If the merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the consummation of the merger will include the procedures that you must follow if
you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. If required by Ocwen
or the paying agent, you may also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss with respect to such certificate. 

Q. Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of my common stock for cash pursuant to the merger? 

A. The exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will require a "U.S. Holder" (as defined below under "Proposal 1—The Approval of
the Merger Proposal—Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger—U.S. Holders" beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement) to recognize a gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger
and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A "Non-U.S. Holder" (as defined below under
"Proposal 1—The Approval of the Merger Proposal—Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger—U.S. Holders" beginning on page 52 of this proxy
statement) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S.
Holder has certain connections to the United States. We recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences
relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction or
other tax laws. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided under "Proposal 1—The Approval of the
Merger Proposal—Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger—U.S. Holders" beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement. 

Q. What happens if I sell my shares before the special meeting? 

A. The record date of the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date that the merger is expected to be consummated. If you transfer
your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but will have transferred
the right to receive $11.00 per share in cash to be received by our stockholders in the merger. In order to receive the $11.00 per share, you must hold your shares
through completion of the merger. See "—The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures" beginning on page 65 for details about the payment of the
merger consideration.

Q. What rights do I have if I oppose the merger? 

A. If you are a holder of our common stock of record, you can vote against the merger by indicating a vote against the proposal by telephone, electronically via the
Internet, or by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card or by voting against the merger in person at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in "street
name," you can vote against the merger in accordance with the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker or other recordholder of your shares. You
are not, however, entitled to dissenting stockholder's appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the merger or any of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under our charter and because our shares of common stock are listed on the NYSE. See "—No Dissenters'
Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders" on page 27. 

Q. Do any directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of PHH's stockholders generally? 

A. In considering the recommendation of our board of directors that you vote to approve the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that aside from their interests as
stockholders of PHH, certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
holders of our common stock. The members of our board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and
negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to our stockholders that the Merger Proposal be approved by our stockholders. For a
description of the interests of our directors and executive officers in the merger, see "Proposal 1—The Approval of the Merger Proposal—Interests of Our Directors
and Executive Officers" beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement. 

Q. When is the merger expected to be consummated? 

A. We are working toward consummating the merger as quickly as possible. We expect the merger to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2018; however, the exact
timing of the consummation of the merger cannot be predicted with certainty. In order to consummate the merger, we must obtain stockholder approval and the
other closing conditions under the merger agreement (including all required notices to, and approvals of, regulatory agencies and government sponsored entities)
must be satisfied or waived. The closing date of the merger will be on the third business day following the first date on which the conditions to closing (described
in the section of this proxy statement entitled "—The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger"), other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied only at the closing (but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the closing), have been satisfied or waived or such other date as the
parties mutually agree. The merger will become effective at such time as the articles of merger are filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of
Maryland, or at such later time as Ocwen and PHH will agree and specify in the articles of merger. 

Q. What effects will the merger have on PHH? 

A. As a result of the merger, we will cease to be an independent, publicly-traded company and will be wholly owned by Ocwen. You will no longer have any interest
in our future earnings or growth. In addition, shares of our common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system, including the NYSE.

Q. What happens if the merger is not consummated? 

A. If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, you will not receive any payment for any
shares of our common stock that you hold of record or beneficially. Instead, PHH will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and
traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. 

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For
example, if your shares of common stock are held in more than one brokerage account or are registered differently, you will receive more than one proxy card or
voting instruction card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or vote via the Internet or telephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that
you receive to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted. 

Q: What is householding and how does it affect me? 

A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have
been received, but only if the applicable company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a
separate notice of the special meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of shares of our common
stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of our common stock, you may have already received householding
notification from your broker. Please contact your bank, broker or other nominee directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy
statement. Your bank, broker or other nominee will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You
may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies. 

Q. Who can help answer my questions? 

A. If you have any questions about the special meeting, the Merger Proposal, the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, how to submit
your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, you should contact our proxy solicitor:

statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the "Securities Act," and
Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of members of our management team, as well as the
assumptions on which such statements are based, and are generally identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "seeks," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects,"
"plans," "intends," "should," "could," "continues," "pro forma" or similar expressions. Among many other examples, the following statements are examples of the forward-

factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and you should consider these important cautionary factors as you read this document.

        Our actual results, performance or achievements, including consummation of the merger, may differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements
that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause such a difference are:

• the inability to complete the merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, or the failure to satisfy other conditions to
consummation of the merger, including the condition relating to the receipt of any required regulatory consent, approval or other authorization, or our
maintenance of certain threshold levels of net worth or available cash; 

• the failure of the merger to close for any other reason; 

• the occurrence of any event, change or circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, including in circumstances requiring us to
pay Ocwen a termination fee of $12,600,000; 

• the nature, cost and outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be initiated against PHH or any of its subsidiaries or any of the other parties to the
merger agreement;

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors for use at the special meeting to be held on June 11,
2018, starting at 10:00 a.m. local time, at the Company's offices located at 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054 for the following purposes: to consider and vote
upon: (1) the Merger Proposal, (2) the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal, (3) if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal; and (4) such other business as may
properly come before the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement at Annex A.

Record Date 

        Our board of directors has specified the close of business on April 3, 2018 as the record date for purpose of determining our stockholders who are entitled to receive notice
of and to vote at the special meeting. Only our stockholders of record on the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of
the record date, there were 32,557,494 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. Each share of our common
stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters properly coming before the special meeting.

        As of April 3, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, our current directors and current executive officers held and are entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 319,054 shares
of our common stock, representing less than 1.0% of our issued and outstanding common stock.

Quorum; Vote Required 

        Under Section 1.05 of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, a quorum consisting of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting must be represented in
person or by proxy for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Therefore, holders of at least a majority of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the record
date and entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum to conduct business at the special meeting. In
the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that we will adjourn or postpone the special meeting to solicit additional proxies.

        Pursuant to Article EIGHTH, paragraph (a)(4) of our Articles of Amendment and Restatement and as permitted by Section 2-104(b)(5) of the Maryland General Corporation
Law, or the "MGCL," the approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of our common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter, notwithstanding the requirements of Section 3-105(e) of the MGCL otherwise requiring authorization by a greater proportion for
that purpose. Under Section 1.05 of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the approval of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at a special meeting at which a quorum is present.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        Abstentions.    You may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN for each of the Merger Proposal, the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
For the Merger Proposal, the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, abstentions, if any, will be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. The Merger Proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of

Table of Contents

the shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions will be counted as votes cast or shares
voting on the Merger Proposal, as applicable, and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" in determining the outcome of the vote on the Merger Proposal. The
Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require the approval of the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at a
special meeting at which a quorum is present. Accordingly, for the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, abstentions will not be counted as
votes cast on these proposals and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for these proposals.

        Broker Non-Votes.    Under the rules of the NYSE, brokers who hold shares in street name for customers have the authority to vote on "routine" proposals when they have
not received instructions from beneficial owners. Brokers, however, are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving non-routine matters such as
the approval of the Merger Proposal, the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. As a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial
owner of such shares, brokers cannot vote those shares, which are referred to generally as "broker non-votes." These "broker non-votes" will be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, and will be counted as votes cast or shares voting on the Merger Proposal, as applicable, and will have
the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" in determining the outcome of the vote on the Merger Proposal, since the Merger Proposal must be approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting. With respect to the
Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, however, broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on these proposals and will have no effect on
the outcome of the vote for these proposals, since each proposal requires the approval of the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at a special meeting
at which a quorum is present.

        Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, via the Internet, by returning the enclosed proxy card by mail, or by
voting in person by appearing at the special meeting. If you submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, or by returning a signed proxy card by mail, your shares will be voted
at the special meeting as you indicate. If you submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, or sign and return your proxy card by mail, without indicating your vote, your
shares will be voted "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal, and, if necessary or appropriate, "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal. The
persons named in the accompanying proxy card will also have discretionary authority to vote on any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

        If your shares of common stock are held in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your
shares voted. If your shares of our common stock are held in "street name" by your bank, broker or other nominees, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on
how to vote such shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your broker. If you do not vote or do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to
vote, it will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal. With respect to the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal,
however, if you do not vote or do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares of common stock, your shares will not be counted as votes cast and
will have no effect on the outcome of the votes for these proposals.

be brought before the special meeting. If, however, any other matter properly comes before the special meeting, or in the event of any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting, proxy holders will vote thereon in accordance with their discretion.

Adjournments and Postponements 

        Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. Whether or not a quorum is
present, a special meeting of stockholders may be adjourned without notice by announcement made at the special meeting, of the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting.
Any proxies submitted by telephone or electronically by the Internet, or signed proxies received by us, in whom no voting instructions are provided on such matter will be voted
"FOR" the Adjournment Proposal to approve any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies.

No Dissenters' Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders 

        Under our charter and the MGCL, holders of our common stock are not entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar
rights in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Subject to the limited circumstances set forth in Section 3-202(d)
of the MGCL, the MGCL does not provide for appraisal rights or other similar rights to stockholders of a corporation in connection with a merger of a corporation if the shares of

PROPOSAL 1—THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL 

        The following discussion of the merger does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should read the entire merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the
merger.

The Merger Proposal 

        We are asking you to consider and vote upon a proposal, which we refer to as the "Merger Proposal," to approve the merger of POMS Corp, or "Merger Sub," a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Ocwen Financial Corporation, or "Ocwen," with and into PHH with PHH surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen in an all
cash transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis, which we refer to as the "merger," on the terms and conditions of that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 27, 2018, which we refer to at the "merger agreement," by and among Ocwen, Merger Sub and PHH. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

Vote Required 

        The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required for the approval of the Merger Proposal. This means that, of the
shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the Merger Proposal (regardless of whether the holders of such shares are present in person or by proxy at the
special meeting), a majority must be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal in order for the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement to be approved. As a
result, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the Merger Proposal, although they will be considered present for the purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum.

        The members of our board of directors, who beneficially owned an aggregate of less than 1.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock as of April 3, 2018, the record
date for the special meeting, have indicated that they will vote in favor of the Merger Proposal.

The Parties to the Merger 

PHH Corporation 

        PHH Corporation was incorporated in 1953 as a Maryland corporation. For periods between April 30, 1997 and February 1, 2005, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of
Cendant Corporation (now known as Avis Budget Group, Inc.) and its predecessors and provided mortgage banking services, facilitated employee relocations and provided
vehicle fleet management and fuel card services. On February 1, 2005, we began operating as an independent, publicly traded company pursuant to our spin-off from Cendant.
On July 1, 2014, we sold our Fleet Management Services business and began operating as a stand-alone mortgage business.

        Our mortgage business has provided outsourced mortgage banking services to a variety of clients, including financial institutions and real estate brokers throughout the U.S.
and focused on originating, selling, servicing and subservicing residential mortgage loans through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PHH Mortgage Corporation and its subsidiaries,
or collectively, "PHH Mortgage". In March 2016, we announced that management and our board of directors were undertaking a comprehensive review of all strategic options
for our company.

        As a result of the strategic review process, in November 2016, we announced our intentions to exit our Private Label Services origination business, or "PLS business". We
are substantially complete with the wind-down of the PLS business, subject to certain transition support requirements. During 2017, we

completed the delivery of $661 million of Mortgage servicing rights, or "MSRs," and advances under our sale agreements with New Residential Mortgage, LLC, or "New
Residential," and Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC, or "Lakeview," which are collectively referred to as the "MSR Sale," and pursuant to ordinary course sales to other third
parties. As part of these sales, we increased our subservicing and portfolio retention units through agreements with New Residential. Between August 2017 and December 2017,
we completed the sale of certain assets of PHH Home Loans, LLC, or "PHH Home Loans," to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, LLC, or "GRA," a new joint venture established by
Guaranteed Rate, Inc. and Realogy Holdings Corp., or "Realogy". We purchased Realogy's membership interests at book value on March 19, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, we
have substantially completed the liquidation of the residual assets of PHH Home Loans and the results of our Real Estate channel will be presented as discontinued operations for
our quarter ended March 31, 2018. These strategic actions to date allowed us to progress towards achieving a new business model of operating as a smaller, less capital-intensive
business focused on subservicing and portfolio retention services.

POMS Corp 

        POMS Corp, a Maryland corporation is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen that was formed exclusively for the purpose of executing the merger agreement and
effecting the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Merger Sub has not carried on any activities to date other than those incident to its formation and the

the continued pursuit of the Company's business plan as an independent company.

        Following the collapse of the subprime lending market and the decline in home values in 2007 and 2008, and coupled with the related global recession, disruption in the
capital and secondary mortgage markets, reduced liquidity and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, and severe financial challenges of the
government sponsored mortgage finance entities, the U.S. federal government became increasingly involved in the mortgage and financial services industries. In the years that
followed, the federal government implemented and imposed numerous regulations, licensing requirements and increased governmental oversight. This wave of regulation
included the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010, under which the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which we
refer to as the "CFPB") was charged with, among other things, administering new regulations for the mortgage industry. State governments also implemented additional
regulations, licensing requirements and governmental oversight programs, and refined their interpretation and application of existing regulations and their enforcement practices.
These changes in the aggregate led to a significant increase in the cost and complexity of originating and servicing residential mortgages across the industry. As the economy
recovered from the recession, record-low interest rates and several government led incentives boosted the mortgage industry during the refinancing wave from 2010 through
2012. Beginning in 2013 and into 2015, the Company witnessed housing price rebounds in parts of the U.S. and increases in interest rates on longer-term government securities
and in yield requirements for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. In the ensuing years following the refinancing boom, mortgage origination volumes would
decrease significantly.

        In light of these market conditions and in order to maximize stockholder value, our board of directors and senior management, with the assistance of the Company's
financial advisors, conducted a strategic review process in the first half of 2014 in which more than 50 potentially interested parties (including Ocwen) were contacted. As a
result of this process, the Company sold its fleet business to Element Financial Corporation in July 2014 for approximately $1.4 billion. The Company did not receive any
actionable proposals to acquire either the Company in its entirety or the mortgage business through this process.

        Through the second half of 2014 and into 2016, the Company returned $300 million to stockholders, reduced its unsecured debt by $680 million and pursued opportunities
to improve the profitability of the mortgage business. However, during this time, the Company's operating environment became increasingly challenging due to the significantly
enhanced regulation and oversight unique to the PLS business model. While the Company is not a bank, the PLS business subjects the Company to both direct and indirect
banking supervision, and each PLS client requires a unique regulatory compliance model. The Company was confronting limited prospects for moderation in client and
regulatory oversight, increased client demand for customization, and a shrinking market as clients in-sourced originations to gain greater control and to satisfy their own
regulatory and oversight requirements.

        In light of these challenges, on March 9, 2016, the Company publicly announced that our board of directors was undertaking a comprehensive review of all strategic options.
As part of this process, in accordance with the directives of our board of directors, the Company's financial advisors contacted 57 parties, comprised of 34 industry participants,
17 financial sponsors and six other potential buyers. 38 of these parties (including Ocwen) executed confidentiality agreements and received confidential information of the
Company. The confidentiality agreements contained customary standstill provisions that would fall away in whole or in part upon the Company's announcement of its entry into a
change of control transaction or a transaction for the sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and in any event the standstill provisions contained an exception that allowed the
bidders to make a confidential proposal to our board of directors at any time (or, in a few cases, to make confidential requests to our board of directors to amend or waive any
provision in the confidentiality agreement). While the Company received four preliminary indications of interest to acquire the whole company, all of those proposals were
abandoned by the bidders before any advanced discussions were held.

        The Company decided during the course of its strategic review process to exit its correspondent lending business and the PLS business, and outsource certain mortgage
processing, underwriting and closing services for the PLS Business to Lenderlive Network, LLC (which we refer to as "Lenderlive"). Further, following extensive negotiations
with multiple parties through the second half of 2016, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell its portfolio of MSRs to Lakeview and New Residential in two
separate transactions. In connection with the sale of MSRs to New Residential, New Residential agreed to retain the Company as a subservicer for at least three years following
the completion of the sale, subject to certain early termination rights. In February 2017, the Company also agreed to sell certain assets and liabilities of PHH Home Loans, its
joint venture with Realogy, to GRA, and, after the consummation of the asset sale, liquidate the residual assets of PHH Home Loans and acquire Realogy's membership interest
in PHH Home Loans (we refer to these transactions collectively as the "Home Loans Transactions").

        During the course of the strategic review process, our board of directors and the Company's management, with the assistance of the Company's legal and financial advisors,
also spent a significant amount of time evaluating the possibility of a sale of the assets of the Company followed by a dissolution of the Company, which we refer to as the
"Liquidation Scenario," the potential risks and benefits to the Company's stockholders in that scenario, and the comparison of the Liquidation Scenario to the continuation of the
Company as an independent company with a capital-light business comprised of subservicing and the related portfolio retention businesses, which we refer to as "PHH 2.0".

        While Ocwen was one of the parties contacted during the 2016 strategic review process, Ocwen did not submit a proposal during the process. However, in December 2016,
in accordance with the directives of our board of directors to continue to explore strategic options for the Company, the Company's financial advisor, Credit Suisse Securities
(USA) LLC (which we refer to as "Credit Suisse"), met on behalf of the Company with Ocwen to discuss a potential strategic transaction with the Company. Thereafter,
members of the senior management of Ocwen and PHH had a call in early December 2016 regarding a potential strategic transaction and, on January 11, 2017, the senior
managements of Ocwen and PHH met, together with Ocwen's and PHH's respective financial advisors, to discuss their respective companies and the potential for a strategic
transaction.

        On January 20, 2017, our board of directors met, together with members of management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Latham & Watkins LLP, counsel to our board
of directors (which we refer to as "Latham"), and Jones Day, outside legal counsel to the Company. Following extensive discussions, our board of directors decided that, while
there were many potentially favorable aspects of a transaction with Ocwen that merited further consideration, including the potential for scale and synergies, there were also a
number of factors that would complicate any transaction, including regulatory considerations. In addition to these issues, our board of directors took into account that the
Company was then in final negotiations with GRA regarding the Home Loans Transactions and with LenderLive regarding the outsourcing agreement for the PLS Business, and
was also in the process of executing the sale of its MSR portfolio. Accordingly, our board of directors decided that pursuing a strategic transaction with Ocwen at the time was
not feasible and that the Company should focus in the near term on completing the pending strategic actions and revisit a potential transaction with Ocwen in the coming months.

        On February 15, 2017, the Company announced its intent to transition to PHH 2.0. PHH 2.0 was designed to allow the Company to continue as a going concern and create
incremental value through scaled-down business operations, while also maintaining strategic flexibility, maximizing near-term capital distributions, and preserving the value of
its tax assets. The Company decided to pursue PHH 2.0 instead of the Liquidation Scenario because of the uncertainty regarding the execution and restructuring costs, contingent
liabilities and potentially prolonged timeframe for capital distributions to stockholders in the Liquidation Scenario. However, our board of directors recognized at the time that

Table of Contents

the PHH 2.0 business model also entailed certain risks, including execution risk (particularly the dependence on subservicing unit growth through business development efforts),
competitive risk, legal and regulatory risks, and client concentration risk—after giving effect to the sale of MSRs to New Residential, New Residential and Pingora Loan
Servicing, LLC would represent approximately 64% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's subservicing portfolio (by units). In connection with the announcement of PHH
2.0, the Company also announced its intention to return excess cash to its stockholders after the consummation of the asset sale transactions resulting from the strategic review
process.

        In the months following the announcement in February 2017 of the Company's decision to pursue the PHH 2.0 business model, the Company received substantial negative
feedback from certain of its stockholders regarding the decision. There was skepticism among such stockholders about the profitability and long-term viability of the PHH 2.0
business model and the time and investment that may be required for PHH 2.0 to be successful. Some stockholders questioned whether the potential proceeds from a dissolution
of the Company would be more than PHH 2.0's projected return. Certain stockholders also urged the Company to accelerate cost-cutting measures and evaluate its remaining
capital structure to maximize the near-term return of capital to stockholders and minimize the amount of investment in PHH 2.0 in the near-term.

        As it began the transition to PHH 2.0, the Company began implementing a series of measures to restructure the Company's remaining businesses and shared services
platform in an effort to substantially reduce overhead costs. In addition, our board of directors instructed management to prepare a long-range forecast of the Company under the
PHH 2.0 business model, and a refreshed analysis of the potential proceeds if the Company were to pursue the Liquidation Scenario.

        During this period, the senior management teams of the Company and Ocwen held discussions from time to time regarding their respective companies' business, regulatory
positions and the possibility of a potential strategic transaction. In early April 2017, Ocwen submitted a preliminary due diligence request to the Company and the Company
provided the requested materials. Following its review of the due diligence materials, on April 19, 2017, Ocwen submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire the
Company for $685 million in the aggregate, or $12.78 per share. On April 20, 2017, the Company's management, with the assistance of Credit Suisse, provided certain feedback
to Ocwen on its indication of interest. On April 22, 2017, Ocwen submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest increasing its proposed purchase price to $754 million in
the aggregate, or $14.06 per share. The Company's senior management discussed Ocwen's proposal with members of our board of directors, and the directors were generally of
the view that, given the regulatory matters facing each of the Company and Ocwen, including the actions filed by the CFPB and state mortgage and banking regulatory agencies
against certain subsidiaries of Ocwen on April 20, 2017 and shortly thereafter, it was not feasible to pursue a strategic transaction with Ocwen in the near term since the
regulatory and execution risks relating to any such transaction would be too significant. Accordingly, the directors instructed management to focus on pending strategic actions
and revisit the possibility for a strategic transaction with Ocwen later in the year.

        Around the same time, an investor in mortgage-related assets, which we refer to as "Company A", expressed an interest in a strategic transaction with the Company. While
Company A's interest in such a transaction soon declined, the two companies remained in touch and held general discussions periodically.

        At a special meeting of stockholders held on May 31, 2017, the Company's stockholders approved the sale of MSRs to New Residential and the Home Loans Transactions.

        On June 1, 2017, Company A expressed an interest in resuming discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction and submitted a due diligence request list to the
Company. Around the same time, the Company also had preliminary discussions with two other participants in the subservicing industry,

which we refer to as "Company B" and "Company C," regarding a potential transaction involving the Company's subservicing platform.

        In its continuing efforts to maximize stockholder value, at the beginning of June 2017, our board of directors instructed management, with the assistance of Credit Suisse, to
engage with all parties that had expressed an interest in a potential transaction since the Company's announcement of PHH 2.0 in February 2017, including Ocwen. In accordance
with our board of directors' instructions, Company A was given access to the Company's online data room by mid-June. On June 22 and June 23, 2017, representatives of the
Company held a series of due diligence sessions with representatives of Company A, covering a wide range of topics, including operations, legal proceedings, compliance
matters and employee matters. On June 23, 2017, Ocwen received access to the online data room. The senior management of the Company also had discussions with the senior
management of each of Company B and Company C regarding the framework for a potential transaction. Ocwen, Company A and Company B were all under confidentiality
agreements that were entered into in connection with the 2016 strategic review process. Company C did not participate in the 2016 strategic review process and entered into a
confidentiality agreement with a standstill provision that allowed it to make a confidential proposal to our board of directors at any time.

        In the meantime, our board of directors instructed Credit Suisse to reassess the universe of potential strategic partners and identify a list of counterparties that might be
interested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company given the current composition of the Company's business after giving effect to the asset sale transactions and the
Company's exit from various businesses.

        Our board of directors met on June 28, 2017, together with management, Credit Suisse and Latham. During this meeting, Credit Suisse discussed potential transaction
counterparties. Credit Suisse noted that, based on the feedback (or lack thereof) from counterparties following the Company's announcement of PHH 2.0, it believed most of the
counterparties that had expressed interest in the Company's subservicing platform during the 2016 strategic review process were unlikely to have a serious interest in pursuing a
strategic transaction with the Company at this time. Our board of directors and the Company's management and advisors discussed the fact that while a few of the counterparties,
including Company B, might be interested in acquiring the Company's subservicing platform, such a transaction would likely be followed by a liquidation of the Company and
expose the Company's stockholders to the Liquidation Scenario risks previously considered by the board of directors during the course of the Company's strategic review.
Following extensive discussions, our board of directors decided that the Company should focus on the ongoing discussions with Ocwen and Company A and, depending on the
outcome of these discussions, selectively contact additional potential counterparties.

        In the weeks following the June 28 board meeting, the Company's management continued to engage with Ocwen and Company A and provided additional due diligence
materials to each party. On July 11, 2017, representatives of Ocwen attended a management presentation given by the Company as well as due diligence sessions covering
different aspects of the Company's business.

        On July 17, 2017, following extensive due diligence, Company A submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire the Company for a cash purchase price of
$725 million—$775 million in the aggregate, or $13.50—$14.50 per share. Company A's proposal assumed, among other things, that up to $700 million of the cash purchase
price would be in the form of a cash dividend paid by the Company to its stockholders prior to the closing. Following the receipt of Company A's proposal, in accordance with
the directives of our Board of Directors, the Company's management and Credit Suisse discussed with Company A certain aspects of the proposal, including the tax implications
of a cash dividend for the Company's stockholders. By late July, discussions with Company A had slowed as a result of both the potential adverse tax implications of the
proposed cash dividend to the Company's stockholders and Company A's desire to postpone further discussions until after the release of the

Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2017. In the meantime, Ocwen continued its due diligence efforts with a view towards establishing an updated indication of
value for a whole-company transaction.

        On August 8, 2017, the Company released financial results for the second quarter of 2017, reporting a net loss of $46 million or $0.86 per basic share for the quarter. While
the subservicing business was performing as expected and the business development pipeline was solid, it was unclear whether the business development efforts would result in
actual client acquisitions. The performance of the portfolio retention business was below expectations.

        Following the Company's release of its second quarter results, Ocwen communicated its updated views on certain aspects of the value of the Company. The Company's
management, with input from the Company's advisors, identified a number of issues with Ocwen's preliminary views, including its assessment of the value of the Company's
deferred tax assets and the potential exposure related to the Company's pending litigation with the CFPB, which we refer to as the "CFPB litigation." Shortly thereafter, Ocwen
and the Company discontinued further conversations regarding a potential transaction.

        During the week of August 14, 2017, Company A informed the Company that it was no longer interested in a whole-company transaction, but instead was potentially
interested in acquiring the equity of PHH Mortgage Corporation. At the same time, Company A expressed concerns regarding the parties' ability to reach agreement on valuation,
the Company's lack of near-term profitability and the potential exposure related to the CFPB litigation. In mid-September 2017, Company A indicated that it had no further
interest in acquiring the Company or the equity of PHH Mortgage Corporation.

        By the end of the third quarter of 2017, the Company had completed the sale of the Ginnie Mae MSRs to Lakeview, was on track to complete the sale of PHH Home Loans
assets to GRA by the end of 2017, and had completed the sale of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MSRs to New Residential. In addition, during the first three quarters of 2017, the
Company returned $301 million of capital to its stockholders through an issuer tender offer and open market purchases, and reduced the outstanding principal amount of its
unsecured debt by $496 million. However, PHH 2.0 was experiencing difficulties as the subservicing portfolio continued to be subject to natural run-off and business
development efforts had not yet produced any material new client acquisitions.

        In early October 2017, the senior management of the Company contacted Ocwen's senior management to assess Ocwen's willingness to reengage with the Company
regarding a potential strategic transaction. By this time, the Company and Ocwen had each made progress on addressing their respective regulatory matters. In particular, the
Company had entered into settlement agreements with the Department of Justice on behalf the Department of Housing and Urban Development and separately on behalf of the
U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to resolve certain matters regarding legacy mortgage origination and underwriting activities, and
Ocwen had reached resolutions with regulatory agencies in approximately half of the states that brought regulatory actions against Ocwen in April 2017. Ocwen indicated that it
would be willing to consider reengaging but would first need an update on certain matters, including the status of pending asset sale transactions, the Company's discussions with
regulators on a multi-state mortgage settlement and a view into the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2017, which was provided on October 12, 2017.

        On October 23, 2017, Ocwen sent an updated due diligence request list to the Company. Two days later, Ocwen submitted a preliminary, written, non-binding indication of
interest to acquire the Company for up to $426 million in the aggregate, or $13.10 per fully diluted share. Ocwen's proposal provided that PHH stockholders would retain
$109 million of potential liabilities relating to the CFPB litigation in the form of contingent value rights, which we refer to as "CVRs," and was conditioned on the completion of
all of the Company's previously announced asset sales.

        Our board of directors met on October 26, 2017, together with management, Credit Suisse and Latham. During the meeting, our board of directors reviewed the terms of
Ocwen's preliminary indication of interest and discussed various aspects of Ocwen's proposal with the advisors, including concerns relating to the CVR structure and the amount
of value it represented and specific areas in which more value might be ascribed. Following extensive discussions, our board of directors decided that it was in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders to further explore a potential transaction with Ocwen, and instructed management, with the assistance of Credit Suisse, to seek an
improvement in Ocwen's proposal, particularly with respect to overall value and the CVR structure.

        The next day, the senior management of the Company and Ocwen, together with their respective legal and financial advisors, held a telephone call to discuss various work
streams relating to a potential transaction, including due diligence. During this call, Ocwen informed PHH that, under the terms of the settlement agreements that it had entered
into with state mortgage and banking regulatory agencies, Ocwen was required to provide these state regulators with 30 days' advance notice and the opportunity to object before
entering into any binding agreement to merge with or acquire an unaffiliated company such as PHH, and that any of these regulators could object to Ocwen's entry into such
strategic transaction during this 30-day period.

        During the following weeks, members of the Company's senior management, together with representatives of Credit Suisse, held a series of meetings with representatives of
Ocwen to discuss the terms of Ocwen's proposal and to provide additional due diligence information regarding the Company.

        On November 7, 2017, the Company released financial results for the third quarter of 2017, reporting a net loss of $55 million or $1.14 per basic share. The subservicing
business was experiencing higher than expected repurchase, indemnification and delinquent servicing expenses coupled with higher payoff amortization, and the portfolio
retention business continued to perform below expectations.

        On November 16, 2017, Ocwen sent a draft merger agreement and CVR term sheet to the Company. The draft documents contemplated, among other things, (i) that Ocwen
would have full control of the CFPB litigation after the closing, (ii) that the CVRs would not be transferable for a period of six months post-closing, and (iii) that the transaction
would be conditioned upon the Company having both a specified amount of available cash and a minimum equity value.

        During the month of November, the Company held preliminary discussions with another participant in the subservicing industry, which we refer to as "Company D,"
regarding the possibility of a potential strategic transaction. Company D was under a confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with the 2016 strategic review process
and received data room access on November 20, 2017.

        On November 20, 2017, Ocwen submitted an updated, written, non-binding indication of interest to acquire the Company for up to $391 million in the aggregate (or $11.94
per fully diluted share), consisting of $282 million in cash and $109 million in the form of CVRs. Ocwen indicated that the reduction in its proposed purchase price was primarily
due to the lower earnings forecast provided by the Company and the anticipated impact of the proposed tax reform legislation, which was expected to eliminate loss carryback
provisions. Upon review of Ocwen's updated indication of interest, the Company's management, with input from Credit Suisse, provided certain feedback on Ocwen's proposed
purchased price.

        Our board of directors met on November 30, 2017, together with management, Credit Suisse, Latham and Jones Day. During the meeting, our board of directors discussed
potential strategic options for the Company. Credit Suisse updated our board of directors regarding the discussions held with potential counterparties over the last few months,
noting that, among other things:

• despite the Company's public disclosure of its 2016 strategic review process and the broad outreach to solicit interest from third parties beginning in 2014 and
continuing through 2017,

Ocwen was the only party that had indicated interest in a whole company transaction at this time;

• Company A had discontinued discussions regarding a potential transaction several months prior and, based on discussions at that time, was viewed as unlikely to
resume discussions; 

• Company C had indicated that it had decided not to pursue an acquisition of the Company, but expressed willingness to consider a potential transaction in which
Company C was acquired; 

• Company D had discontinued discussions following initial due diligence indicating, among other things, the significant amount of work that needed to be
undertaken by the Company in order to transition to the PHH 2.0 business model; and 

• there were a few counterparties (including Company B) that expressed interest in the Company's subservicing platform, but not in a whole company transaction,
and those counterparties that had provided a preliminary indication of value were ascribing zero or negative value to the subservicing platform as a result of
subservicing client risk and certain one-time costs associated with a platform sale.

        Credit Suisse also discussed with our board of directors certain preliminary financial matters pertaining to the Company. In connection with these discussions, management
of the Company reviewed with our board of directors a long-range forecast for the Company, including related assumptions and risks, and updated our board of directors on
management's analysis of the Liquidation Scenario. Following these discussions, Jones Day reviewed with our board of directors the terms of the proposed merger agreement
with Ocwen and the CVR term sheet, highlighting a number of material issues in the proposed documents. Following extensive discussions, our board of directors was of the
view that, despite certain material issues, including significant concerns with respect to the CVR, the proposed transaction with Ocwen still represented the best option for the
Company's stockholders. Accordingly, our board of directors instructed management and the advisors to continue negotiations with Ocwen, with particular focus on price, CVR
terms and certainty of closing.

        In accordance with our board of directors' instructions, the Company's senior management proposed to Ocwen an increased purchase price of $405 million in the aggregate,
and Jones Day sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Ocwen's outside legal counsel, which we refer to as "S&C." Following further
discussions between the Company and Ocwen, on December 11, 2017, Ocwen increased its proposed purchase price to up to $398 million in the aggregate (or $12.15 per fully
diluted share), consisting of $289 million in cash and $109 million in the form of CVRs. Later that day, S&C sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Jones Day. Jones
Day and S&C also exchanged comments on the CVR term sheet.

        On December 14, 2017, the senior managements of PHH and Ocwen, together with their respective legal and financial advisors, met in person to negotiate the terms of the
proposed transaction. Among other things, the parties discussed the terms of the CVR, including the control of the CFPB litigation prior to and after the closing, the closing
conditions relating to the Company's minimum equity value and available cash, and the allocation of risks relating to the pre-signing regulatory advance notice process.
Following extensive discussions, the parties generally agreed, among other things, that:

• PHH would control the defense of the CFPB litigation, subject to a few specified limitations; and 

• a minimum net worth threshold would be more appropriate than a minimum equity value threshold and the finance teams of the Company and Ocwen would work
to determine the appropriate formula and thresholds for net worth and available cash, in each case subject to certain carve-outs.

        During the following weeks, the senior managements of the Company and Ocwen had a series of discussions regarding the determination of net worth and available cash.
As part of these discussions, the parties agreed that the purchase price would be subject to downward adjustments if the Company's net worth declined by more than
$22.5 million below the projections provided to Ocwen, provided that in no event would any such adjustment exceed $18,750,000 in the aggregate. During the same period,
Jones Day and S&C exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement, the CVR term sheet and related documentation.

        On January 19, 2018, in light of the substantial progress on the negotiation of the merger agreement and CVR term sheet, Ocwen and the Company decided that Ocwen
could commence the pre-signing regulatory advance notice process, and Ocwen subsequently contacted regulators in 31 states regarding the potential transaction.

        In addition, in light of the fact that New Residential represents 58% of the Company's subservicing portfolio (by units as of December 31, 2017), the Company and Ocwen
both were of the view that it would be prudent to seek New Residential's written consent to the transaction, as required by its subservicing agreement, prior to signing a definitive
agreement. If such consent were not obtained, New Residential would have the right to terminate its subservicing agreement and transfer the loans subserviced by the Company
either internally or to another subservicer. Accordingly, on January 22, 2018, senior managements of the Company and Ocwen informed New Residential of the potential
transaction on a confidential basis and requested its written consent to the transaction.

        During the next few weeks, the Company, Jones Day, Ocwen and S&C continued to negotiate the merger agreement and a CVR agreement.

        On January 31, 2018, the en banc court of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which we refer to as the "DC Circuit Court of Appeals,"
reinstated the October 2016 panel decision in the CFPB litigation as it related to issues under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (which we refer to as "RESPA"),
including vacating the CFPB order that imposed $109 million of disgorgement penalties on the Company. Over the course of the next week, representatives of PHH and Ocwen
held a series of discussions regarding the implications of the en banc decision and potential next steps in the CFPB litigation. In the course of these discussions, the Company
informed Ocwen that, in light of the en banc decision by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the Company believed that its potential exposure to monetary penalties from the CFPB
litigation had been reduced significantly and that a CVR was no longer appropriate.

        During the week of February 12, 2017, the Company was informed by two existing subservicing clients of their intention to remove portions or all of their respective
businesses totaling approximately 115,000 units, representing approximately 17% of the Company's subservicing portfolio (by units as of December 31, 2017), from the
Company's platform between the second quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, placing further pressure on the Company's growth plans.

        On February 16, 2018, Ocwen sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to the Company as part of a package proposal on the proposed transaction. As part of its package
proposal, Ocwen agreed to remove the CVR consideration, but also reduced the aggregate purchase price to $360 million in cash (or $11.00 per fully diluted share). Ocwen
indicated that the price reduction was primarily due to the Company's recent client losses and additional uncertainty regarding the Company's remaining clients. Ocwen also
informed PHH that, at the request of certain state regulators, Ocwen had agreed to extend the review period for the pre-signing regulatory non-objection process to February 23,
2018.

        Our board of directors met on February 18, 2018, together with management, Credit Suisse, Latham and Jones Day. At the meeting, members of management and Credit
Suisse reviewed Ocwen's package proposal with our board of directors. Members of management updated our board of directors on recent client losses and the continuing
challenges facing the PHH 2.0 business model. Management also updated our board of directors on recent acquisitions and other strategic developments involving

certain industry participants, which had resulted in intensified competitive pressure. Following extensive discussions, our board of directors decided to continue pursuing the
proposed transaction with Ocwen on the basis of its package proposal, and instructed management and the advisors to seek to improve Ocwen's proposed purchase price and
continue negotiations on the transaction documents.

        On February 19, 2017, members of the Company's and Ocwen's senior management discussed certain aspects of Ocwen's proposal. Ocwen indicated it was unwilling to
increase its proposed purchase price, but agreed there would be no purchase price adjustment for declines in the Company's net worth below the projections provided to Ocwen.
Ocwen retained the right to terminate the transaction should the Company's net worth or available cash fall below certain thresholds. In the next few days, management of the
Company and Jones Day exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement and disclosure schedules with Ocwen and S&C, and continued negotiating the transaction
documents.

        On February 24, 2018, the Company received New Residential's written consent with respect to the proposed transaction with Ocwen, and Ocwen informed the Company
that the pre-signing regulatory advance notice period had lapsed without Ocwen receiving any objections.

        Our board of directors met on February 25, 2018, together with management, Credit Suisse, Latham, Jones Day and DLA Piper LLP (US), Maryland counsel for the
Company (which we refer to as "DLA"). At the meeting, members of management and the Company's advisors reviewed with our board of directors the strategic review process
undertaken by the Company in recent years, including the broad auction process conducted in 2016, the proposals received by the Company since the 2016 process, and the
potential strategic options considered by our board of directors since the announcement of PHH 2.0 in February 2017, including the Liquidation Scenario. Management of the
Company presented an updated long-range forecast for the Company, as well as a financial analysis of the Liquidation Scenario. Management also noted that while the Company
had successfully reduced its cost infrastructure in 2017, the Company's business development efforts under the PHH 2.0 model had not resulted in meaningful new business, the
Company was experiencing natural runoff of loans in its subservicing portfolio and the Company was behind expectations for both subservicing units and portfolio retention
volume. Meeting participants discussed in detail the execution risk associated with transitioning to and operating PHH 2.0, and noted that the proposed transaction represented an
opportunity to mitigate certain risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business transformation and growth efforts. Meeting participants also discussed the impact
of the recently passed tax reform, which effectively removed tax shields on future losses, creating further pressure on achieving the necessary scale within an acceptable
timeframe. Our board of directors then discussed the proposed transaction with Ocwen in detail. In connection with this discussion, Jones Day reviewed the terms of the proposed
merger agreement with Ocwen, including closing conditions, the parties' commitment to seek to obtain regulatory approvals and our board of directors' ability to exercise its
fiduciary out. In addition, Credit Suisse reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of the merger consideration. Following extensive discussions, our board of directors
reaffirmed its view that among the strategic options available to the Company, including continued operation as a standalone company and the Liquidation Scenario, the proposed
transaction with Ocwen presented the best option for the Company's stockholders. Accordingly, our board of directors instructed management and the advisors to finalize the
transaction documents as soon as practicable.

        During the next two days, the Company, Jones Day, Ocwen and S&C engaged in a series of discussions to resolve outstanding points on the transaction documents and
exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement and disclosure schedules.

        Our board of directors met again on February 27, 2018, together with management, Credit Suisse, Latham, Jones Day and DLA. At the beginning of the meeting, DLA
reviewed the directors' fiduciary duties under Maryland law in connection with their consideration of a sale of the Company. Management then updated our board of directors
with respect to its forecasts and the status of the transaction, the terms of which had been finalized. Thereafter, Credit Suisse reviewed with our board

of directors its financial analysis of the merger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 27, 2018, to our board of
directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on
the review undertaken, the merger consideration to be received by holders of PHH common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. After further discussions of available alternatives and potential risks, including continuing with the PHH 2.0 business model and the Liquidation Scenario, our
board of directors determined that the proposed merger with Ocwen was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, our board of directors
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby, including the merger, and resolved to recommend the merger agreement to the Company's
stockholders.

        Later in the afternoon of February 27, 2018, following Board approval of the merger agreement and the merger, the Company and Ocwen executed the merger agreement.
Thereafter, the Company issued a press release announcing its entry into the merger agreement.

Past Contacts, Transactions or Negotiations 

        Other than as described under "Background of the Merger" above, we, Merger Sub and Ocwen have not had any negotiations, transactions or material contacts during the
past two years, and other than as described therein and in the merger agreement there are no present or proposed material agreements, arrangements, understandings or
relationships between our executive officers or directors or affiliates and any of Merger Sub or Ocwen, or their respective executive officers or directors.

Reasons for Recommending the Merger 

        Our board of directors unanimously determined that the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement is advisable and in the best interests of our
stockholders, and approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the merger and the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby. Our board of directors recommends that the Company's stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of the merger on the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement.

        In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, our board of directors discussed the proposed transaction with the board of directors' legal
counsel and the Company's management and legal and financial advisors and considered a variety of factors, including the positive factors set forth below, each of which our
Board believed supported its determination:

• our board of directors' knowledge of the PHH 2.0 business model and the business, prospects, financial performance and condition, financial and operating plans,
capital levels and asset quality of the Company and the risks associated with the foregoing if the Company were to remain an independent public company; 

• our board of directors' knowledge of current industry, economic and market conditions and industry trends, and the risks associated with the foregoing if the
Company were to remain an independent public company; 

• our board of directors' knowledge of the Company's competitive position within relevant markets, including the impact of consolidation within the industry and
the emergence of competitors with considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, lower funding cost, access to more diverse funding sources,
and broader product lines; 

• the strategic review processes undertaken by our board of directors over the course of the last few years (including the public, broad-based process to explore a
sale of the Company or one or more of its principal businesses in 2016), and our board of directors' evaluation of the alternative means of creating stockholder
value available to the Company, including continuing

the PHH 2.0 plan as a standalone company and a liquidation of the Company, and the significant risks and uncertainties and value implications associated with
these alternatives;

• the fact that the Company's operations had not been profitable in recent years and the operating losses were expected to continue; while the Company had
successfully reduced its cost infrastructure in 2017, the Company's business development efforts under the PHH 2.0 model had not resulted in meaningful new
business, the Company was experiencing loss of subservicing customers in addition to natural runoff of loans in its subservicing portfolio and the Company was
behind expectations for both subservicing units and portfolio retention volume; 

• our board of directors' belief that the merger consideration of $11.00 per share was more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the potential value that
might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the Company at the time the merger agreement was approved, including the continued operation of the
Company as an independent company or a liquidation of the Company; 

• the opinion, dated February 27, 2018, of Credit Suisse to the PHH board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of such date, of the
merger consideration to be received by holders of PHH common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in "—Opinion of
the Company's Financial Advisor;" 

• the current and historical market prices of PHH common stock and the fact that the Per Share Price represented a premium of approximately 24% over PHH's
closing stock price of $8.84 per share on February 26, 2018, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the transaction; 

• the fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, providing PHH stockholders certain, near-term value and liquidity for their shares, especially when
viewed against the medium- and long-term market and business risks and the risks associated with realizing current expectations for PHH's future financial
performance; 

• the fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were the product of arm's-length negotiations between
the parties and were designed to provide substantial certainty that the merger would be consummated on a timely basis; and 

• the fact that while the merger agreement prohibits PHH from soliciting a takeover proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by PHH"), the
merger agreement permits PHH and our board of directors, prior to the time that its stockholders adopt the merger agreement, to take the following actions: 

• furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties in respect of any unsolicited written takeover proposal; 

• terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by PHH"), subject to
payment of a $12.6 million termination fee; and 

• to change or withdraw our Board's recommendation of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event (as defined in "The
Merger Agreement—Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Termination"), if our Board determines that the failure to effect a change in
recommendation is likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to our stockholders.

        Our board of directors also considered a variety of risks and potentially negative factors concerning the merger and the merger agreement, including the following:

• the fact that the consummation of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies and
the consents of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, and such approvals and consents may not be obtained; 

• the fact that while Ocwen has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required regulatory approvals, Ocwen is not required to, and PHH may not,
without Ocwen's consent, take any action or agree to any restraint, restriction, limitation, requirement or condition that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to, impair in any material respect the business or financial condition of the combined company, taken as a whole; 

• the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Ocwen has the right not to consummate the merger if PHH fails to maintain its adjusted net worth or
available cash above a certain specified level (see "The Merger Agreement—Material Adverse Effect"); 

• the fact that following the consummation of the merger, PHH will no longer exist as a public company and the stockholders will not be able to participate in any
value creation that PHH could generate going forward, as well as any future appreciation in the value of the combined company; 

• the fact that the mortgage servicing industry has been under intensified regulatory scrutiny since the collapse of the subprime lending market ten years ago, and
the possibility that PHH stockholders could receive greater consideration for their shares in a future change-in-control transaction or otherwise in more favorable
industry conditions; 

• the risk that, if the merger is not completed: 

• the market price of PHH common stock could be affected by many factors, including (i) the reason for which the merger agreement was terminated and
whether such termination results from factors adversely affecting PHH, (ii) the possibility that the marketplace would consider PHH to be an unattractive
acquisition candidate, and (iii) the possible sale of shares by short-term investors following an announcement of the termination of the merger agreement; 

• the market's perception of PHH's continuing business and future prospects could adversely affect PHH's relationships with employees, customers, lenders,
vendors and other business partners as well as PHH's relationships with its regulators; and 

• PHH may not be able to find another buyer for the whole company, and any potential buyer may withdraw its offer without entering into any definitive
agreement; 

• the fact that the merger agreement prohibits PHH from soliciting takeover proposals and requires the payment of a $12.6 million termination fee if PHH were to
terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal, which would make it more costly for any
other potential purchaser to acquire PHH; 

• the fact that the merger agreement contains certain restrictions on the conduct of PHH's business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay or
prevent PHH from undertaking business opportunities that may arise prior to consummation of the merger, and the resultant risk if the merger is not
consummated; 

• the fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for PHH shares pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• the significant costs involved in connection with consummating the merger, the substantial management time and effort required to effectuate the merger and the
related disruption to PHH's day-to-day operations during the pendency of the merger;

• the potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on PHH's business, including uncertainty about the effect of the proposed merger on PHH's employees,
customers and other parties, which may impair PHH's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers and others to seek
to change existing business relationships with PHH; 

• the fact that PHH's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of PHH's stockholders
generally, as described under "The Merger Proposal—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 54; 

• the fact that dissenting stockholders do not have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of PHH common stock under Maryland law; and 

• the risk that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger will be satisfied on a timely basis and, as a result, it is
possible that the merger may be delayed or may not be completed even if the merger agreement is adopted by PHH's stockholders.

        The factors listed above as supporting our board of directors' decisions were determined by our board of directors to outweigh the countervailing considerations and risks.
The foregoing discussion of our board of directors' reasons for its recommendation is not meant to be exhaustive, but addresses the material factors considered by our board of
directors in connection with its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by our board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and
the complexity of these matters, our board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, our board of directors made its determination and recommendation based on the totality of the information presented to
it, and the judgments of individual members of our board of directors may have been influenced to a greater or lesser degree by different factors. The factors, potential risks and
uncertainties contained in this section contain information that is forward-looking in nature and should be read in conjunction with the factors discussed in "Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".

Recommendation of our Board of Directors 

        Our board of directors, at a special meeting held on February 27, 2018, after due consideration, unanimously (i) determined that the merger is advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, (ii) approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger, and (iii) directed that the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by our
stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders. Our board of directors has approved the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal.

Unaudited Financial Projections 

        As a matter of course, PHH does not develop or publicly disclose long-term projections or internal projections of its future performance and is especially wary of making
projections for extended periods given the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates, although PHH in the past has provided investors with limited quarterly
or full-year financial guidance covering discrete areas of its financial performance. However, in connection with the merger, our management prepared certain non-public,
unaudited financial forecast for PHH, which we refer to as the "Financial Projections," and provided the projections to our board of directors to assist our board of directors in
evaluating a possible transaction. The Financial Projections also were provided to Credit Suisse, which was directed

to use and rely upon such projections in connection with its financial analyses and opinion as described in the section entitled "—Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor."

        The Financial Projections reflect numerous judgments, estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to PHH, all of which are inherently uncertain, difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These
assumptions included assumptions about the subservicing market, business development initiatives, operational productivity and interest rates. In addition, certain assumptions
were based on information derived from third parties. Our management believes the Financial Projections were prepared on a reasonable basis and reflected the best then-
currently available estimates and judgments of our management when prepared. The Financial Projections are subjective in many respects and are subject to change based on
actual experience and business developments. As such, Financial Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted, including the various risks set forth in PHH's periodic reports. For additional information regarding these risks,
please see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." There can be no assurance that the projected results will be
realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. The Financial Projections should not be considered necessarily reflective of actual future
results. The Financial Projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.

        The Financial Projections were based upon various assumptions which relate only to the periods presented. The Financial Projections do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.

        The Financial Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with generally accepted accounting principles, the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. All of the Financial Projections (excluding industry projections prepared by third parties) were estimates prepared by our management. In
addition, the Financial Projections are unaudited and neither PHH's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,
examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Financial Projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the Financial Projections. Readers of this document are urged not to place undue reliance
on the unaudited Financial Projections set forth below and PHH urges all stockholders to review PHH's SEC filings for PHH's actual financial results.

        The inclusion of the Financial Projections in this proxy statement is not deemed an admission or representation by PHH or any other person that it considered, or now
considers, the Financial Projections as material information or necessarily predictive of actual future results or events. The Financial Projections are not included in this proxy
statement in order to influence any stockholder of PHH with respect to the approval of the proposal to approve the merger agreement. PHH DOES NOT INTEND TO
UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS INCLUDED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES
EXISTING SINCE ITS PREPARATION OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL
OF THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR, OR TO REFLECT CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY
CONDITIONS.

        Set forth below is a summary of the Financial Projections:

Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor 

        PHH has engaged Credit Suisse to act as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. In connection with this engagement, the board of directors requested
that Credit Suisse evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of PHH common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. On February 27, 2018, at a meeting of the board of directors held to evaluate the proposed merger, Credit Suisse rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated February 27, 2018, to the board of directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken, the merger consideration to be received by holders of PHH common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Credit Suisse's written opinion, dated February 27, 2018, to the board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Credit Suisse in connection with such opinion, is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. The description of Credit Suisse's opinion set forth in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Credit Suisse's opinion. Credit Suisse's opinion was provided to the board of directors (in its
capacity as such) for its information in connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other terms,
aspects or implications of the proposed merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might be available to PHH
or the underlying business decision of the board of directors or PHH to proceed with the merger. Credit Suisse's opinion does not constitute advice or a
recommendation to any securityholder as to how such securityholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the proposed merger or otherwise.

        In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse reviewed an execution version, provided to Credit Suisse on February 27, 2018, of the merger agreement and certain publicly
available business and financial information relating to PHH. Credit Suisse also reviewed certain other information relating to PHH provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse
by the management of PHH, including financial forecasts and estimates relating to PHH provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse by the management of PHH, and Credit
Suisse met with the management of PHH to discuss the businesses and prospects of PHH. Credit Suisse also considered certain financial and stock market data of PHH, and
Credit Suisse compared that data with similar data for companies with publicly traded equity securities in businesses Credit Suisse deemed relevant. Credit Suisse also considered
such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which it deemed relevant.

        In connection with its review, Credit Suisse did not independently verify any of the foregoing information and, with PHH's consent, Credit Suisse assumed and relied upon
such information being complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates for PHH (including, without limitation, as to PHH's
projected net worth and available and distributable cash) that Credit Suisse was directed to utilize in its analyses, the management of PHH advised Credit Suisse, and Credit
Suisse assumed, with PHH's consent, that such financial forecasts and estimates were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of such management as to the future financial performance of PHH and the other matters covered thereby and were appropriate for Credit Suisse's use and reliance
for purposes of its analyses and opinion. Credit Suisse expressed no opinion as to any financial forecasts or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. Credit Suisse
relied, with PHH's consent and without independent verification, upon the assessments of the management of PHH as to, among other things, (i) the pending sale of PHH's
mortgage servicing rights and other asset sales and dispositions, and the exiting of certain businesses, reorganizations, restructurings and other corporate transactions undertaken
by PHH (collectively referred to in this section as the "disposition transactions"), including with respect to the timing thereof and expected amount of distributable cash
therefrom, (ii) the potential impact on PHH of certain market, competitive, cyclical and other trends in and prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters
relating to or otherwise affecting, the residential mortgage and real estate markets and related credit and financial markets, including with respect to interest rates and conditions
in the housing market, (iii) the annual portfolio growth and recapture rates of PHH and (iv) recent events and other aspects relating to PHH's key clients, vendors and other
commercial relationships. Credit Suisse assumed, with PHH's consent, that there would be no developments with respect to any such matters or any adjustments to the merger
consideration that would be meaningful in any respect to Credit Suisse's analyses or opinion.

        In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse was not requested to make, and it did not make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent,
accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of PHH or any other entity, nor was Credit Suisse furnished for purposes of its analyses or opinion with any such evaluations
or appraisals, and Credit Suisse's analyses should not be construed as such. Credit Suisse is not an expert in the evaluation of, and Credit Suisse expressed no opinion with respect
to, loan portfolios or individual credit files or the adequacy or sufficiency of allowances for credit losses with respect to loans or any other matters. Credit Suisse also was not
requested to make, and it did not make, an evaluation of the solvency or fair value of PHH under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters or any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action or governmental investigation or possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which PHH or any
other entity was or may have been a party or was or may have been subject or any reserves therefor, and Credit Suisse assumed, with PHH's consent, that the outcome of such
matters would not be meaningful in any respect to Credit Suisse's analyses or opinion.

        Credit Suisse assumed, with PHH's consent, that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third-party consents, approvals, agreements or waivers in connection with the
merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed or occur that would have an
adverse effect on PHH or the merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to Credit Suisse's analyses or opinion and that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements without waiver, modification or amendment of
any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Representatives of PHH advised Credit Suisse, and Credit Suisse also assumed, with PHH's consent, that the terms of the
merger agreement, when executed, would conform in all material respects to the terms reflected in the execution version reviewed by Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse did not express
any opinion with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, any opinion with

respect to changes in, or the impact of, tax laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies on the merger, PHH or any other participant in the merger, Credit Suisse
assumed that PHH had or would obtain such advice or opinions from appropriate professional sources, and Credit Suisse relied, with PHH's consent, upon the assessments of
representatives of PHH as to such matters.

        Credit Suisse's opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of its date, of the merger consideration (to the extent expressly specified in such
opinion), without regard to individual circumstances of specific holders with respect to any rights or aspects which may distinguish such holders or the securities of PHH held by
such holders, and did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any adjustments to the
merger consideration, the financial or other terms or consequences of any disposition transaction or related distributions or any post-closing reorganizations or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding to be entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by the merger or otherwise. In addition, Credit Suisse's opinion did not address the
fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or other consideration to any officers, directors, employees or securityholders of any party
to the merger or any related entities, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. The issuance of Credit Suisse's opinion was approved by Credit
Suisse's authorized internal committee.

        Credit Suisse's opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to Credit Suisse as of the date of Credit Suisse's opinion and financial, economic, market and
other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on that date. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect Credit Suisse's opinion, and Credit Suisse
does not have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion. Credit Suisse did not express any opinion as to the prices or range of prices at which PHH
common stock or other securities would trade or be transferable at any time, including following announcement of the proposed merger. Credit Suisse's opinion did not address
the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might be available to PHH, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the
board of directors or PHH to proceed with the merger.

        In preparing its opinion to the board of directors, Credit Suisse performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The summary of
Credit Suisse's analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse's opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Credit Suisse arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the
results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis.
Accordingly, Credit Suisse believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying
its analyses and opinion.

        In its analyses, Credit Suisse considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
the control of PHH. No company or business used for comparative purposes in Credit Suisse's analyses is identical to PHH, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is
not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could
affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies or businesses analyzed. The estimates contained in Credit Suisse's analyses and the implied reference
ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In

addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or
acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Credit Suisse's analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        Credit Suisse was not requested to, and it did not, determine or recommend the merger consideration, which was determined through negotiations between PHH and Ocwen,
and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the board of directors. Credit Suisse's opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors
considered by the board of directors in its evaluation of the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the board of directors or management
with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the merger.

Financial Analyses 

        The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled "—Financial Analyses" is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed with the board of
directors in connection with Credit Suisse's opinion dated February 27, 2018. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand Credit Suisse's financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit Suisse's financial analyses.

        Selected Public Companies Analysis.    Credit Suisse reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to PHH and the following two selected companies that
Credit Suisse considered generally relevant as publicly traded companies with principal operations in the mortgage servicing and/or subservicing industry, collectively referred to
as the selected companies:

• Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. 

• Ocwen Financial Corporation

        Credit Suisse reviewed, among other information, closing stock prices as of February 26, 2018 (or, in the case of Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., February 12, 2018,
which was the last trading day prior to public announcement of its proposed sale to WMIH Corp.) as a multiple of tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2017.
Financial data of the selected companies were based on public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of PHH was based on information provided by the
management of PHH, public filings and other publicly available information.

        The overall low to high tangible book value per share (as of September 30, 2017) multiples observed for the selected companies were 0.79x to 1.08x (with a mean and a
median of 0.93x). Credit Suisse noted that the tangible book value per share (as of September 30, 2017) multiple observed for PHH was 0.49x based on publicly available
information. Credit Suisse then applied a selected range of tangible book value per share multiples of 0.50x to 0.80x to PHH's tangible book value as of December 31, 2017 based
on information provided by the management of PHH. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for PHH, as compared to
the merger consideration:

        Dividend Discount Analysis.    Credit Suisse performed a dividend discount analysis of PHH's consolidated operations (consisting of PHH's excess cash inclusive of the
projected cash to be received from PHH's pending sale of its mortgage servicing rights to New Residential Mortgage LLC and PHH's continuing operations) to calculate the
estimated present value of dividends that PHH forecasted would be payable during PHH's fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2026 based on financial
forecasts and estimates prepared by the management of PHH. The present value (as of December 31, 2017) of PHH's excess cash was calculated using a selected range of
discount rates of 8.5% to 16.5%. The implied terminal values for PHH's continuing operations were derived by applying to PHH's estimated tangible book value as of
December 31, 2026 a selected range of tangible book value multiples of 0.50x to 1.10x and the present values (as of December 31, 2017) of the distributable dividends and
terminal values were then calculated using a selected range of discount rates of 13.5% to 21.0%. This analysis indicated the following overall approximate implied per share
equity value reference range for PHH, as compared to the merger consideration:

Certain Additional Information 

        Credit Suisse observed certain additional information that was not considered part of Credit Suisse's financial analyses with respect to its opinion but was noted for
informational purposes, including the following:

• stock price targets for PHH common stock as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts' reports, which indicated an overall low to high
target stock price range for PHH of $11.00 to $12.00 per share; 

• historical trading prices of PHH common stock during the 52-week period ended February 26, 2018, which indicated low and high intraday prices for PHH
common stock during such period of approximately $8.01 and $15.00 per share, respectively; and 

• the approximate implied equity value reference range for PHH derived by the management of PHH assuming an orderly liquidation of PHH of $6.97 to $9.60 per
share.

Miscellaneous 

        PHH selected Credit Suisse to act as financial advisor to PHH in connection with the merger based on Credit Suisse's qualifications, experience and reputation. Credit Suisse
is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and
other purposes.

        PHH has agreed to pay Credit Suisse for its financial advisory services in connection with the proposed merger an aggregate fee of $5.25 million, of which a financial
advisory fee of $2.25 million was previously paid in December 2017 and the remaining $3 million was payable upon delivery Credit Suisse's opinion. In addition, PHH has
agreed to reimburse Credit Suisse for its expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel, and to indemnify Credit Suisse and certain related parties for certain liabilities
and other items, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of or related to its engagement.

        As the board of directors was aware, Credit Suisse and its affiliates in the past have provided and currently are providing investment banking and other financial services to
PHH unrelated to the

Suisse's opinion, having acted or acting as financial advisor to PHH in connection with a series of strategic alternative transactions, including certain asset sales or other
disposition transactions, and as dealer manager for a share repurchase and a senior notes tender offer, for which services Credit Suisse and its affiliates received during such two-
year period aggregate fees of approximately $14 million. As the board of directors also was aware, Credit Suisse and its affiliates in the past have provided and currently are
providing investment banking and other financial services to Ocwen, for which Credit Suisse and its affiliates have received and would expect to receive compensation,
including, during the two-year period prior to the date of Credit Suisse's opinion, having acted or acting as joint dealer manager for a bond exchange offer for Ocwen and as a
joint bookrunner for certain financings, and as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and co-documentation agent for, and as a lender under, certain credit facilities, of Ocwen and
certain of its affiliates, for which services Credit Suisse and its affiliates received during such two-year period aggregate fees of approximately $6.5 million. Credit Suisse and its
affiliates may provide investment banking or other financial services to PHH, Ocwen and their respective affiliates in the future, for which Credit Suisse and its affiliates would
expect to receive compensation.

        Credit Suisse is a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as providing investment banking and other financial services. In
the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse and its affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for Credit Suisse's and its affiliates' own accounts and the accounts of customers, equity,
debt and other securities and financial instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of PHH, Ocwen or any other entity that may be involved in the merger and certain
of their respective affiliates, as well as provide investment banking and other financial services to such entities.

Required Regulatory Approvals 

Antitrust Approvals 

        Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, referred to herein as the "HSR Act" and related rules, certain transactions, including the
merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or the "Antitrust Division,"
and the Federal Trade Commission, or the "FTC," and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On March 26, 2018, both PHH and Ocwen filed their
respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period,
which, unless earlier terminated by the Antitrust Division or the FTC, would have expired on April 25, 2018. The FTC granted early termination of this waiting period effective
April 19, 2018 with respect to both PHH and Ocwen.

        At any time before or after the effective time of the merger, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to prevent the
merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally approve the merger upon the divestiture of assets of PHH or Ocwen or subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In
addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to
enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be
successful.

Federal and State Regulatory Approvals 

        The approvals and notices required to complete the merger on the terms and conditions of the merger agreement include (a) notices to, or approvals of, various state
regulatory agencies of the change in control of PHH or its subsidiaries resulting from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in all U.S. state and commonwealth
jurisdictions, and (b) notices to, and approvals of, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Veterans Administration and the USDA Rural
Development of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We cannot assure you, however, that these consents, waivers, approvals, permits or authorizations will
be obtained in a timely manner, or at all.

Funding for the Merger 

        Ocwen expects to fund the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with a combination of PHH's available cash, Ocwen's available cash and/or Ocwen's
available lines of credit. See "—The Merger Agreement—Material Adverse Effect" for additional information regarding the requirements for PHH to maintain a minimum amount
of available cash under the merger agreement.

Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following discussion is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that are relevant to holders of shares of PHH common stock whose shares
are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the "Code"),
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the "IRS"), and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is
limited to holders who hold their shares of PHH common stock as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment
purposes). This summary does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of
U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., state, gift or alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax). For purposes of this discussion, a
"holder" means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder or both, as the context may require.

        This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances,
including:

• holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, S corporations or
any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, insurance companies, mutual funds,
dealers in stocks and securities, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, or certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States; 

• holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reducing transaction; 

• holders that received their shares of PHH common stock in a compensatory transaction; 

• holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in PHH or the surviving corporation; or 

• U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar.

Table of Contents

        If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of PHH common stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding the shares of PHH
common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.

        We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No
assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A
HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR
FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION OR OTHER TAX LAWS.

U.S. Holders 

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of PHH common stock who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; 

• An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as defined in
section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

        The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of PHH common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder's gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the
shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder's holding period in such shares is more than 1 year at the time of the
consummation of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. There are limitations on the
deductibility of capital losses.

Non-U.S. Holders 

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of PHH common stock who or that is not a U.S. Holder or partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment such as "controlled foreign corporations" or "passive foreign
investment companies." Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to
them in light of their particular circumstances.

Table of Contents

        Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits
tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); 

• such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified
conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); or 

• we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation" (referred to as "USRPHC"), at some point during the applicable statutory period, and the
Non-U.S. Holder's shares of PHH's common stock represent a "U.S. real property interest" (referred to as "USRPI"), under the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act (referred to as "FIRPTA").

        Under FIRPTA, dispositions of a USRPI by a foreign person are generally subject to U.S. federal income taxation. If any class of stock in a USRPHC is regularly traded on
an established securities market, stock of such class generally will be considered a USRPI with respect to a foreign person if such foreign person held, directly or constructively,
at any time during the applicable test period, more than 5% of the value of the regularly traded class of stock.

        We believe that we have not been a USRPHC during the applicable statutory period.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

        Payments made in exchange for shares of PHH common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and backup
withholding. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. Holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return an IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties
of perjury that such U.S. holder is a "United States person" (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such U.S. holder
is not subject to backup withholding.

        A Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on the cash received in exchange for shares of PHH common stock unless the Non-U.S.
Holder establishes an exemption, for example, by properly certifying its non-U.S. status on an appropriate version of IRS Form W-8.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder's U.S. federal income
tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

No Dissenters' Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders 

        Under our charter and the MGCL, holders of our common stock are not entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar
rights in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Subject to the limited circumstances set forth in Section 3-202(d)
of the MGCL, the MGCL does not provide for appraisal rights or other similar rights to stockholders of a corporation in connection with a merger of a corporation if the shares of
the corporation are listed on the NYSE on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on the transaction. The circumstances of the merger do not satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 3-202(d) of the MGCL that would trigger such appraisal rights or similar rights.

Delisting and Deregistration of our Common Stock 

        If the merger is consummated, following the effective time, our common stock will cease trading on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. As such,
we would no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Effects on the Company if the Merger is not Completed 

        If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their
shares of PHH common stock. Instead, PHH will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the
Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

        Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be consummated, it is likely that the price of
our common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the
date of this proxy statement.

        Accordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of our common
stock. If the merger is not consummated, our board of directors will continue to evaluate and review our business operations, assets, operating results, financial condition,
prospects and business strategy, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate and will continue to evaluate all strategic options to seek to enhance
stockholder value. If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to PHH will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.

        In addition, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Ocwen a termination fee of $12,600,000 upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described
under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee" beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.

Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers 

        In considering the recommendation of our board of directors that you vote to approve the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that aside from their interests as
stockholders of PHH, certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the holders of our
common stock. The members of our board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement
and the merger, and in recommending to our stockholders that the Merger Proposal be approved. PHH's stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether
to vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified within the narrative disclosure
and the table below. The merger will constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term of similar meaning for purposes of PHH's executive compensation and benefit
plans described below.

Certain Assumptions 

        Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of describing the potential payments and benefits in this section, the following assumptions were used:

• The relevant price per share of shares of our common stock is $11.00, which is the per share merger consideration.

• Solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section, the assumed date of the closing of the merger is April 3, 2018. Each executive officer of PHH employed as of
April 3, 2018 experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by PHH without "cause," resignation by the executive officer for "good reason," or
resignation by the executive officer because his employment becomes "non-comparable employment," or term of similar meaning, as such terms are defined in the
relevant PHH plans and agreements as in effect on the date hereof, immediately following the assumed closing on April 3, 2018.

Severance 

Tier I Severance Plan

        PHH maintains an Amended and Restated Tier I Severance Pay Plan, effective May 19, 2016, which we refer to as the "Tier I Severance Plan," that sets forth the severance
benefits to which our current executive officers (other than Mr. Stephen P. Staid), including Messrs. Robert B. Crowl, Michael R. Bogansky and Alberino J. Celini, Ms. Madeline
Flanagan and Ms. Kathleen A. Williamson are entitled to, and to which our former executive officers Mr. Glen A. Messina, Ms. Kathryn M. Ruggieri, Mr. William F. Brown, and
Mr. Leith M. Kaplan became entitled upon entering into Separation and General Release Agreements, subject to their compliance with certain restrictive covenants following
their terminations of employment in 2017. The four former executive officers departed from the Company on June 28, 2017, June 30, 2017, December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2017, respectively.

        The severance benefits as set forth in the Tier I Severance Plan to which our current executive officers (other than Mr. Staid) are entitled and to which each of Mr. Messina,
Ms. Ruggieri and Messrs. Brown and Kaplan became entitled include: salary continuation for one year (except for Mr. Messina who is entitled to receive salary continuation for
two years), which runs concurrent with the duration of the non-compete and nonsolicitation provisions contained in restrictive covenant agreements executed as a condition of
participation in PHH's long-term incentive plan; 100% of the target amount of the cash incentive bonus award granted to the participant under the Management Incentive Plan for
the year in which the qualifying termination occurs, payable over the salary continuation period; outplacement assistance services in an amount not to exceed the annual
limitation imposed under Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code for the year of termination ($18,000 in 2017) to be used within 24 months of the termination; and payment
of an amount equal to the cost of COBRA coverage for one year (except for Mr. Messina who is entitled to payment of an amount equal to the cost of COBRA coverage for two
years).

Employment Agreements

        Each of Mr. Robert C. Crowl, who was appointed Chief Executive Officer on June 28, 2017, and Mr. Michael R. Bogansky, who was appointed Chief Financial Officer on
March 29, 2017, are party to an employment agreement that governs their respective rights to severance benefits. Each employment agreement provides the right to receive the
same severance benefits described above under the Tier I Severance Plan (which, for each, is one year with respect to salary continuation and COBRA coverage) upon a
termination by PHH without "cause" or a resignation by the executive for "good reason," in each case, subject to execution of a general release agreement and compliance with
certain restrictive covenants.

Tier II Severance Plan

        Mr. Staid's right to severance benefits is governed by the PHH Amended and Restated Tier II Severance Pay Plan, effective November 30, 2017, which we refer to as the
"Tier II Severance Plan". Mr. Staid is our only current executive officer who is not entitled to the severance benefits set forth in

Table of Contents

the Tier I Severance Plan. Under the Tier II Severance Plan, Mr. Staid becomes entitled to certain severance benefits, subject to his execution of a release and compliance with
certain restrictive covenants, upon an involuntary termination due to (1) a reduction in PHH's workforce, (2) elimination or discontinuation of his position provided that he is not
offered a comparable position, or (3) other circumstances appropriate for the payment of severance as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Human Capital and
Compensation Committee of our board of directors. The severance benefits to which Mr. Staid would become entitled under the Tier II Severance Plan consist of 26 weeks of
salary. The severance benefits payable under the Tier II Severance Plan are not impacted by the merger.

Quantification of Severance Payments Under the Tier I Severance Plan, Tier II Severance Plan and Employment Agreements

        See the section entitled "—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger" for an estimate of the value of the severance benefits that would become payable to each of PHH's named executive officers upon a qualifying
termination immediately following the merger. Since Mr. Messina, Ms. Ruggieri, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kaplan incurred a qualifying termination prior to the assumed closing date
of April 3, 2018, the merger will have no impact on the severance benefits that they are currently receiving, and no severance amounts are reflected for them. Although the
merger will have no impact on Mr. Staid's right to receive severance under the Tier II Severance Plan, an estimate of the value of the severance benefits that would become
payable to him under such plan upon a qualifying termination is reflected below. The estimated aggregate value of severance benefits that would become payable to PHH's six
current executive officers as a group upon a qualifying termination immediately following the merger based on the assumptions described above under "—Certain Assumptions"
is $3,472,354.

Compensation Granted under PHH 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan 

Treatment of Stock Options

        All of the PHH stock options held by the executive officers were fully vested and exercisable as of April 3, 2018. Since all of the stock options have a per share exercise
price greater than the merger consideration, all of the stock options will be cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment.

Time-Based Restricted Stock Units and Time-Based Restricted Cash Units

        At the effective time of the merger, pursuant to the merger agreement, each PHH time-based restricted stock unit (whether cash settled or stock settled) and each PHH time-
based restricted cash unit award that tracks the value of a share of PHH common stock, including each such award held by a director or executive officer of PHH, that is
outstanding as of the effective time will accelerate in full and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unit and (2) the per share merger consideration. Certain of PHH's current
executive officers (none of whom are named executive officers) hold time-based restricted cash units that represent the right to receive $1.00. Such awards will become vested
upon a termination by PHH without "cause" or a resignation by the executive for "good reason," following the merger and must be settled within 60 days of such executive
officer's termination or resignation.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

        At the effective time of the merger, pursuant to the merger agreement, each PHH performance-based restricted stock unit (whether cash settled or stock settled), including
each such award held by an executive officer of PHH, that is outstanding as of the effective time will accelerate in full and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a
cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unit determined based
on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals through immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, as reasonably determined by the Human
Capital and Compensation Committee of our board of directors, and (2) the per share merger consideration. Based on expected actual performance immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, which is based on the assumed stock price of $11.00, all of the outstanding performance-based restricted stock units will not vest and will be
cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment.

Restricted Shares

        At the effective time of the merger, pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of our common stock that is subject to vesting, repurchase, or other lapse restrictions, all of
which are held by directors of PHH, will accelerate in full and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the per share merger consideration.

Cash Performance Incentive Awards

        At the effective time of the merger, the applicable performance criteria for our executive officers' outstanding cash performance incentive awards granted in 2018 will be
considered met. Upon the occurrence of either a termination by PHH without "cause" or the executive officer's resignation for "good reason" following the merger, such cash
performance incentive awards (the applicable performance criteria of which will have been considered met in connection with the merger) must be settled within 60 days of such
executive officer's termination or resignation.

Quantification of Cash Performance Incentive Awards and Equity-Based Compensation Granted under PHH 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan

        See the section entitled "—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger" for an estimate of the value of the unvested cash performance incentive awards and restricted stock units held by each of PHH's named executive
officers that would become vested in connection with a qualifying termination of employment following the closing of the merger based on the assumptions described above
under "—Certain Assumptions" and in the footnotes to the table below (including assumptions relating to the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria). Such
section will also include an estimate of payments to be made in connection with the merger to Mr. Messina, Ms. Ruggieri, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kaplan, each of whom terminated
employment with PHH prior to April 3, 2018, in cancellation of outstanding vested equity awards held by each of those former PHH named executive officers. Based on those
assumptions, the estimated aggregate value of the unvested restricted stock units and shares of our common stock subject to vesting, repurchase, or other lapse restrictions held
by PHH's six non-employee directors that would become vested in connection with the merger, is $147,873, assuming a per share price of $11.00. In addition, the estimated
aggregate value of the restricted stock units held by PHH's six non-employee directors that are vested, but that would be cancelled and paid out in connection with the merger is
$1,128,127, assuming a per share price of $11.00. None of PHH's six current executive officers, other than Messrs. Crowl and Bogansky, for whom the value of the vesting of
such awards is reflected in the table below, hold outstanding unvested restricted stock units that would become vested in connection with the merger. The estimated aggregate

employment immediately following the merger, based on the applicable performance criteria being deemed met in connection with the merger and based on the assumptions
described above under "—Certain Assumptions," is $935,625. The estimated aggregate value of the unvested restricted cash units that represent the right to receive $1.00 held by
PHH's six current executive officers (none of whom are named executive officers) that would become vested in connection with a qualifying termination of employment
immediately following the merger is $157,150.

Management Incentive Plan

        As part of PHH's annual compensation process, PHH grants cash incentive bonuses under the PHH 2018 Management Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the "MIP."
Under the terms of the MIP and the 2018 awards, the applicable performance criteria will be deemed met at the target level upon the closing of the merger. If an executive officer
is terminated without "cause" or resigns for "good reason" following the merger and before such bonuses are paid, then the cash incentive bonuses payable under this MIP will be
paid within sixty (60) days of such termination or resignation. Such bonus will be pro-rated to the extent a qualifying termination occurs during the plan year. See the section
entitled "—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger" for an estimate of the value of 2018 MIP awards that could become payable to Messrs. Crowl, Bogansky, and Staid upon a qualifying termination immediately following
the merger, which will trigger deemed achievement of the applicable performance criteria at target levels. The estimated aggregate value of 2018 MIP awards that could become
payable to PHH's six current executive officers upon a qualifying termination immediately following the merger, based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria at
target levels and based on the assumptions described above under "—Certain Assumptions," is $419,010. Mr. Messina, Ms. Ruggieri, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kaplan did not receive
2018 MIP awards.

Cash Retention Awards

        From time to time, PHH awards special cash retention awards to employees that vest based on continued employment with PHH through a specified date. Under the terms of
Mr. Staid's 2017 cash retention award, such award will vest and must be settled within 30 days of his involuntary termination due to a job elimination, reduction in force, or
group layoff. Mr. Staid's 2017 cash retention award is not impacted by the merger. With respect to cash retention awards granted in 2018, if an executive officer who has received
such an award is terminated by PHH without "cause" or the executive officer resigns for "good reason" following the merger, such cash retention award will vest and must be
settled within 60 days of such executive officer's termination or resignation. See the section entitled "—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers—Quantification of
Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger" for an estimate of the value of cash retention awards that could become
payable to Messrs. Crowl, Bogansky, and Staid upon a qualifying termination immediately following the merger. Although the merger will have no impact on the vesting of
Mr. Staid's 2017 cash retention award, an estimate of the value of such award that would become payable to him upon a qualifying termination is reflected below. The estimated
aggregate value of cash retention awards that could become payable to PHH's six current executive officers upon a qualifying termination immediately following the merger
based on the assumptions described above under "—Certain Assumptions" is $1,168,500. Mr. Messina, Ms. Ruggieri, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kaplan do not have any outstanding
cash retention awards.

Indemnification and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, PHH's non-employee directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under
certain directors' and officers' liability insurance policies following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance."

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger 

        The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about certain
compensation for each named executive officer of PHH that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on
multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do
not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:

• The relevant price per share of the shares of our common stock is $11.00, which is the per share merger consideration. 

• Solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section, the assumed date of the closing of the merger is April 3, 2018. Each named executive officer of PHH
employed as of April 3, 2018 experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by PHH without "cause," resignation by the named executive officer
for "good reason," or resignation by the named executive officer because his employment becomes "non-comparable employment," or term of similar meaning, as
such terms are defined in the relevant PHH plans and agreements as in effect on the date hereof, immediately following the assumed closing on April 3, 2018.

cancellation of those outstanding vested equity awards under the PHH 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan in connection with the merger.

(2) Cash. Includes for Messrs. Crowl and Bogansky (a) salary continuation for one year, (b) 100% of the target amount of the cash incentive bonus award
granted to the named executive officer under the MIP, which would be payable over the salary continuation period, (c) pro-rated vesting of the 2018
MIP awards calculated with applicable performance criteria deemed to be achieved at target levels, which would be payable in a lump sum within
60 days of termination, (d) full vesting of the 2018 cash performance incentive awards granted under PHH's 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan, calculated
with applicable performance criteria deemed to be achieved at target levels, which would be payable in a lump sum within 60 days of termination, and
(e) full vesting of the 2018 cash retention awards, which would be payable in a lump sum within 60 days of termination. The 2018 cash retention award
payments are "double-trigger" and vest prior to December 31, 2018 only upon a qualifying termination of employment during the 2018 calendar year
following the merger. Includes for Mr. Staid (i) 26 weeks of salary continuation, (ii) pro-rated vesting of his 2018 MIP award calculated with applicable
performance criteria deemed to be achieved as target levels, which would be payable in a lump sum within 60 days of termination, (iii) full vesting of
his 2018 cash performance incentive award granted under PHH's 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan, calculated with applicable performance criteria
deemed to be achieved at target levels, which would be payable in a lump sum within 60 days of termination, (iv) full vesting of the 2017 cash retention
award, which would be payable in a lump sum within 30 days of termination, and (v) full vesting of the 2018 cash retention award, which would be
payable in a lump sum within 60 days of termination. Although the merger itself will result in the 2018 MIP awards and the 2018 cash performance
incentive awards being deemed achieved at target performance levels, such payments are "double-trigger" and vest early only upon a qualifying
termination of employment following the merger. Although the merger will have no impact on Mr. Staid's right to receive severance under the Tier II
Severance Plan or the vesting of his 2017 cash retention award, the amount of severance he would receive under such plan upon a qualifying
termination and the value of his 2017 cash retention award that would vest and become payable upon a qualifying termination are included in the table
below. The estimated cash compensation table below reflects no values for Mr. Messina, Ms. Ruggieri, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kaplan because those
individuals already incurred a qualifying termination prior to the merger, are receiving severance benefits consistent with the Tier I Severance Plan and
pursuant to their individual Separation and General Release Agreements, and the merger will have no impact on the cash compensation provided
thereunder. The estimated amount of each such payment that will vest under the assumptions described above is shown in the following table:

taxes) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unit (with respect to PHH performance-based restricted
stock units, based on actual performance immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as determined by the Human Capital and Compensation
Committee of our board of directors, which, based on the assumed stock price of $11.00, would result in all of the performance-based restricted stock
units being valueless), multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration. In addition, this figure includes the payments made in cancellation of
outstanding vested equity awards under the PHH 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan, including those made to previously terminated executive officers, all
of which are already vested. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, such vesting and payments are "single-trigger" and will occur as a result of
the merger itself. All of the PHH stock options held by the named executive officers were fully vested and exercisable as of April 3, 2018 with exercise
prices that exceed the per share merger consideration. Therefore, the merger will have no impact on the vesting of the named executive officers'
outstanding PHH stock options and no value is attributed to them. None of the named executive officers have any outstanding time-based restricted cash
units that track the value of a share of PHH common stock and no value is attributed to them. The estimated value of the PHH restricted stock units that
will vest or become payable under the assumptions described above is shown in the following table:

(4) Perquisites/Benefits. Includes (a) outplacement assistance services valued at $18,500 to be used within 24 months of the qualifying termination and
(b) payment of an amount equal to the cost of COBRA coverage during the duration of the one-year restricted covenants. Such benefits are "double
trigger" and are payable only in connection with a qualifying termination of employment. The estimated perquisites/benefits compensation table below
reflects no values for Mr. Messina, Ms. Ruggieri, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Kaplan because those individuals already incurred a qualifying termination prior
to the merger, are receiving severance benefits consistent with the Tier I Severance Plan and pursuant to their individual Separation and General Release
Agreements, and the merger will have no impact on the perquisites/benefits compensation provided thereunder. None of our named executive officers
are entitled to tax reimbursements or gross-ups in connection with the merger. The estimated perquisites/benefits compensation table below reflects no
value for Mr. Staid as his entitlement to severance benefits under the Tier II Severance Plan is limited to salary continuation. The estimated value of
these benefits is shown in the following table:

Post-Signing Events 

Litigation 

        On April 17, 2018, a putative class action captioned Lei v. PHH Corporation, et. al., Case No. 1:18-cv-07934 was filed on behalf of the Company's stockholders against the
Company and its directors in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company's directors have
breached their fiduciary duties by approving the sale of the Company to Ocwen at an inadequate price after an inadequate process. The complaint also alleges that the defendants
have violated federal securities laws because the preliminary proxy statement for the merger was materially misleading and omitted certain material facts. The complaint seeks,
among other things, an injunction preventing the consummation of the merger and damages in an unspecified amount.

        The outcome of this lawsuit is uncertain. The Company believes this lawsuit is without merit.

Ocwen's New CEO Appointment 

        On April 19, 2018, Ocwen announced that its board of directors has determined to appoint Glen Messina, who had served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of
PHH and a director of PHH from January 2012 to June 2017, as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocwen, effective upon the consummation of the merger. Ocwen
entered into an offer letter with Mr. Messina on April 17, 2018, which offer letter sets forth the terms and conditions of Mr. Messina's employment with Ocwen. Ocwen disclosed
that, in the event the effective date of the merger does not occur, the offer letter with Mr. Messina will terminate.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the
information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The description of the merger agreement in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the primary contractual document that governs the merger.

        Additional information about PHH and Ocwen may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in other public reports and documents filed with the SEC. Please see the
section of this proxy statement entitled "Where You Can Find More Information," beginning on page 90.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. The merger
agreement is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about PHH, Ocwen or Merger Sub, and the following summary of the merger agreement
and the copy thereof attached hereto as Annex A are not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosure about PHH in any documents it publicly files with the SEC. The
representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by PHH, Ocwen and Merger Sub were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement
and are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by PHH, Ocwen and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular,
in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and
warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close the merger if
the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the merger
agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts.

        The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and
documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the
merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy
statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement, and subsequent developments or new information that may affect the accuracy of a representation or
warranty may or may not be fully reflected in this proxy statement or PHH's public disclosures. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties as being
accurate or complete or characterizations of the actual state of facts as of any specified date.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws 

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into PHH upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in the merger agreement. As the
surviving corporation, PHH will continue to exist following the merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocwen.

        The parties have agreed under the merger agreement that, from and after the effective time, the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will
become the initial directors of the surviving corporation, until their respective successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. From and after the
effective time, the officers of PHH

immediately prior to the effective time will become the initial officers of the surviving corporation, until their respective successors are duly appointed or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

        The articles of incorporation of PHH will be amended and restated at the effective time to be in the form of the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the effective time (with necessary changes to reflect the name, date of incorporation, registered office and registered agent of PHH), which will be the
articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law (subject to compliance with requirements in the
merger agreement regarding the inclusion of provisions providing for the exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to PHH's officers, directors and
certain other individuals).

        At the effective time, the bylaws of PHH will be amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
effective time, and as so amended and restated will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the articles of
incorporation of the surviving corporation and applicable law.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        Unless the parties otherwise agree, the closing of the merger, which we refer to as the "closing," will take place on the third business day following the first date on which
the conditions to closing (described in the section of this proxy statement entitled "—Conditions to the Merger"), other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
only at the closing (but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the closing), have been satisfied or waived.

        The merger will become effective at such time as the articles of merger are filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, or at such later time as
Ocwen and PHH will agree and specify in the articles of merger.

Merger Consideration and Conversion of PHH shares 

        At the effective time, each share of PHH common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares owned by Ocwen or Merger Sub
(excluding shares held by Ocwen and Merger Sub in mutual funds and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties),
will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 per share in cash, without interest, which we refer to as the "merger consideration," subject to adjustment (if any) as described
in the next paragraph.

        If at any time during the period between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, any change in the outstanding shares of PHH common stock occurs as a
result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend with a record date during such period, the
merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change. In addition, if PHH pays any cash dividend (subject to Ocwen's prior consent) between the date of the
merger agreement and the effective time, the merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted such that the aggregate amount of consideration payable in respect of PHH
common stock and equity awards will be reduced by the aggregate amount of such cash dividend.

        At the effective time, each share of PHH common stock owned by Ocwen or Merger Sub (excluding shares held by Ocwen and Merger Sub in mutual funds and the like or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties) will be canceled without payment of any consideration.

Exchange and Payment Procedures 

        At or promptly after the effective time, Ocwen will deposit with a paying agent selected by Ocwen (subject to the consent of PHH), which we refer to as the "paying agent,"
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration payable to holders of our common stock in accordance with the merger agreement. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the effective time, the paying agent will mail to each holder of our shares a letter of transmittal in customary form and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such holder's certificated or uncertificated shares in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. If you are a stockholder of record, you will not be entitled to
receive the merger consideration until you have surrendered your stock certificates (or followed the procedures applicable to lost stock certificates) or transferred your
uncertificated shares to the paying agent along with a duly executed letter of transmittal.

        You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a letter
of transmittal.

        Ocwen, Merger Sub, the surviving corporation (or any of their subsidiaries) and the paying agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable required taxes from
the merger consideration. In the event any amount is deducted or withheld from the merger consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Our common stock (and is paid over
to the applicable taxing authorities), that amount will be treated as having been paid to that holder.

        At the effective time, the stock transfer books of PHH will be closed and there will be no further registration of transfers of PHH stock in the stock transfer books. On or
after the effective time, any certificated or uncertificated shares of PHH common stock presented to the paying agent or the surviving corporation will be cancelled and
exchanged for the merger consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in the merger agreement.

        The paying agent will invest the aggregate merger consideration deposited with it as directed by Ocwen in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Any interest
and other income resulting from any such investments will be paid to the surviving corporation. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments or the fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the merger consideration, Ocwen will promptly replace or restore the cash in the fund lost
through such investments or other events to ensure that the fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to promptly pay the merger consideration.

        If any portion of the aggregate merger consideration deposited with the paying agent remains unclaimed by holders of PHH common stock twelve months after the effective
time, if requested by Ocwen, the paying agent will deliver such amount to the surviving corporation. Holders of PHH common stock who have not exchanged their shares for the
merger consideration will thereafter only look to the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration, subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. None
of Ocwen, the surviving corporation or the paying agent will be liable to holders of PHH common stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

Lost Certificates 

        If any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, in order to be entitled to receive the merger consideration in respect of such certificate, the person claiming the certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed must make an affidavit of that fact and, if required by Ocwen or the paying agent, post a bond, in an amount as Ocwen may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

Treatment of Equity Awards 

        At the effective time, any equity awards of PHH outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be treated as follows:

• Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of $11.00 over the per share exercise price of the stock option, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding
taxes. Since all of the outstanding stock options have a per share exercise price greater than $11.00, all of the stock options will be cancelled at the effective time
for no consideration or payment. 

• Each time-based restricted stock unit (whether cash settled or stock settled) and each time-based restricted cash unit that tracks the value of a share of our common
stock, in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will accelerate in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such unit multiplied by (y) $11.00, without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding taxes. 

• Each performance-based restricted stock unit (whether cash settled or stock settled) that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will accelerate in
full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of our common stock subject to
such unit based on the actual performance through immediately prior to the effective time, as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the board
of directors of PHH, multiplied by (y) $11.00, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Based on expected actual performance
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which is based on the assumed stock price of $11.00 and will be determined by the Human Capital and
Compensation Committee of our board of directors, all of the performance-based restricted stock units will be valueless and will be cancelled at the effective time
for no consideration or payment. 

• Each share of PHH common stock granted under PHH's equity incentive plans that is subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions will accelerate in
full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Conditions to the Merger 

        The respective obligations of PHH, Ocwen and Merger Sub to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the effective time of the following
conditions:

• the approval of the merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
on the matter; 

• the filing of notifications with, or the receipt of consents and approvals from certain governmental authorities or government-sponsored enterprises required for
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, a list of which is set forth in the confidential disclosure letter delivered by each party to the

be true and correct in all material respects, (b) the representations and warranties of PHH regarding PHH's capitalization and the absence of certain changes since

material adverse effect since January 1, 2017 will be true and correct in all respects, in each case of (a), (b) and (c) without giving effect to any qualification or

will be so true and correct as of such specified date);

• Ocwen's and Merger Sub's performance in all material respects of their covenants and agreements in accordance with the merger agreement at or prior to the
closing date; and 

• the receipt by PHH of a certificate signed on behalf of Ocwen and Merger Sub by an executive officer of Ocwen to the effect that the foregoing conditions have
been satisfied.

        None of Ocwen, Merger Sub or PHH may rely on the failure of any closing condition to be satisfied to excuse such party from its obligation to effect the merger if such
party's breach of the merger agreement or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has
been the primary cause of or resulted in the condition of such condition to be satisfied.

Material Adverse Effect 

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "PHH material adverse effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development that (i) has a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of PHH and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (excluding those assets, liabilities, businesses and
employees that have been or will be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to or assumed by the applicable purchasers as a result of the PHH Home Loans transactions or PHH's
sale of its portfolio of mortgage servicing rights to New Residential Investment Corp., which we refer to as the "MSR sale") or (ii) materially impairs or delays beyond the
outside date (as defined below in "—Termination of the Merger Agreement"), or would reasonably be expected to materially impair or materially delay beyond the outside date,
PHH's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Further, a PHH material adverse effect will be deemed to have occurred if PHH's adjusted net worth is more than $47.5 million below a prescribed amount (which
prescribed amount ranges from approximately $393 million to approximately $489 million, depending on the date of measurement) or if PHH fails to maintain a minimum
amount of available cash of a prescribed amount (ranging from approximately $293 million to approximately $367 million). The parties have agreed that certain changes in
PHH's net worth or cash will be excluded from the determination of adjusted net worth and available cash. For example, if PHH makes any cash dividends or other capital
distributions with Ocwen's consent after the date of the merger agreement, the amount of cash used for such capital distribution will not reduce PHH's adjusted net worth or
available cash under the merger agreement. For purposes of determining whether the closing condition relating to minimum adjusted net worth or minimum available cash is
satisfied, adjusted net worth and available cash will be measured the first day on which all of the closing conditions described above in "—Conditions to the Merger" (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied only on the closing date and conditions relating to the receipt of regulatory approvals that Ocwen has to obtain in order to
consummate the merger) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted under applicable law, waived. PHH will be required to deliver its estimates of adjusted net worth and
available cash within two business days thereafter. Ocwen has the right to dispute PHH's calculation of the amount of adjusted net worth and available cash (excluding PHH's
legal analysis in determining the amount of cash that is distributable under the applicable provisions of Maryland law) and, if PHH and Ocwen are unable to any such dispute,
either party may submit the disputed item to a mutually acceptable independent accountant for resolution.

Table of Contents

        In determining whether a PHH material adverse effect has occurred for purposes of prong (i) of the definition described above, the following changes and circumstances
(and their effects) will be excluded:

• any failure, in and of itself, by PHH and its subsidiaries to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any period
ending on or after the date of the merger agreement (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be deemed
to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a PHH material adverse effect, except to the extent otherwise excluded
under the merger agreement); 

• the public announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the impact thereof on the relationships
(contractual or otherwise) of PHH or any of its subsidiaries with employees, customers, suppliers or partners, and any litigation arising from allegations of any
breach of fiduciary duty or violation of law relating to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby; 

• any hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster; 

• any decline in the market price of PHH common stock; 

• any action or omission taken pursuant to the express terms of the merger agreement, with the express prior written consent of Ocwen or Merger Sub, or any action
taken by Ocwen or Merger Sub after PHH's disclosure to Ocwen and Merger Sub of all material and relevant facts and information to the knowledge of PHH; or 

• certain matters set forth in the confidential disclosure letter delivered by PHH to Ocwen in connection with the merger agreement.

        In addition, the following changes and circumstances (and their effects) will be excluded in determining whether a PHH material adverse effect has occurred for purposes of
prong (i) of the definition described above, unless any such change or circumstance has a disproportionate impact on PHH and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other
for-profit participants in the industries in which PHH and its subsidiaries conduct their businesses:

• changes in general economic or political (including results of elections) conditions (including any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war or any act of
terrorism) or changes in the securities, credit or financial markets in general, including changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates; 

• changes after the date of the merger agreement that adversely and generally affect the industry in which PHH and its subsidiaries operate; or 

• the Tax Reform Act or changes after the date of the merger agreement in laws, statutes, rules or regulations of governmental entities, or interpretations thereof by
governmental authorities, applicable to PHH and its subsidiaries, or in U.S. GAAP or applicable accounting regulations or principles.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "Ocwen material adverse effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially delay beyond the outside date or materially impair the ability of Ocwen or Merger Sub to consummate the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approvals 

        The merger agreement requires each of the parties to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger as soon as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts (i) to obtain all consents, approvals, rulings or
authorizations that are required to be obtained under applicable law, (ii) to obtain any consents required from third parties, (iii) to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order
or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (iv) to effect as promptly as practicable all
necessary registrations, filings and responses to requests (if any) for additional information or documentary material from any governmental authority.

        Without limiting the generality of the agreements in the preceding paragraph, Ocwen has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and
do (or cause to be done) all things that any governmental authority indicates would be required in order to obtain any required governmental approvals or avoid any injunction or
law that would enjoin, prevent or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, however, nothing in the merger agreement will
be deemed to require Ocwen or Merger Sub or permit PHH to take any action, or commit to take any action or agree to any restraint, restriction, limitation, term, requirement,
provision or condition that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to, impair in any material respect the business or financial condition of Ocwen and its
subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries) , taken as a whole (we refer to each such restraint, restriction, limitation, term, requirement, provision or
condition as a "burdensome condition"). In addition, nothing in the merger agreement will be construed to require any party to take any action in violation of applicable law or
commence any litigation with any governmental authority to oppose any enforcement action by any governmental authority or remove any regulatory orders impeding the parties'
ability to consummate the merger.

        Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Ocwen will have the right to direct all matters with any governmental authority to the extent relating to
the required governmental approvals consistent with its obligations under the merger agreement, and PHH may not make any registration, filing or response relating to the
required governmental approvals without Ocwen's prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, PHH
will be able to respond to questions, information requests and other inquiries from any governmental authority without Ocwen's prior written consent as long as such responses
do not contain any commitments or agreements that would be binding upon Ocwen or the surviving corporation or is otherwise material to the transactions contemplated the
merger agreement that Parent has not consented to previously.

Representations and Warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by PHH, Ocwen and Merger Sub to each other. The statements embodied in those representations and
warranties were made solely for purposes of the merger agreement and for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations
agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement (including in the confidential disclosure letter delivered by PHH to Ocwen and the
confidential disclosure letter delivered by Ocwen and Merger Sub to PHH, in each case in connection with the merger agreement). In addition, some of those representations and
warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to stockholders or may have been used
for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement rather than establishing matters as facts.

        PHH has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions described below, it will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and its or their respective
officers, directors, employees and representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing information) any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) with
respect to, or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in, any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or
similar transaction involving PHH or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the assets of PHH and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or
indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of PHH common stock or voting power of PHH, (iii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition,
directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or
other equity interests in PHH or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise) of any business or assets of PHH or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of PHH and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any
person (or the stockholders of any person) or group of persons securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of PHH, (v) any tender offer or exchange offer as a result of which any person or group will
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the voting power of PHH or (vi) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case of (i) through (vi), other than the merger), which we refer to as a "takeover proposal"; 

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any person with
respect to any takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a takeover proposal; 

• approve or recommend any takeover proposal; 

• approve, recommend, execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share purchase
or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal (each such letter, memorandum or agreement is
referred to as an "acquisition agreement"); 

• enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring PHH to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or breach its obligations thereunder; or 

• propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        In addition, PHH has agreed to, promptly after the execution of the merger agreement, immediately cease all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any takeover proposal, and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any such person or its
representatives.

        Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
takeover proposal that did not result from any material breach of the non-solicitation restrictions described above and certain other provisions of the merger agreement, PHH may
(i) contact the person making such takeover proposal to clarify the terms and conditions of the takeover proposal and (ii) if our board of directors concludes in

good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a "superior proposal" (as
defined below), PHH may:

• furnish information with respect to PHH and its subsidiaries to the person or group of persons who has made such takeover proposal pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement that contains (x) confidentiality terms that are, as determined by PHH in good faith, no less favorable in the aggregate to PHH than those contained in
the confidentiality agreement with Ocwen and (y) a customary standstill provision, as long as any material non-public information furnished to such person or
group has previously been provided to Ocwen or is provided to Ocwen substantially concurrently with the provision of such information to such person or group;
and 

• participate in discussions regarding the terms of such takeover proposal and the negotiation of such terms with the person making such takeover proposal.

        Under the merger agreement, the term "superior proposal" refers to any bona fide written takeover proposal made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third
party (or, in a parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting
power of PHH or substantially all of the assets of PHH and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with its legal and financial advisors) (i) to be superior to the holders of PHH common stock from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement with Ocwen (taking into account any changes proposed by Ocwen to the terms of the merger agreement) including the merger (including the merger consideration),
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the person making the proposal (including all financial, regulatory, legal conditions to consummation and
other aspects of such proposal), (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in
part), is not a condition to closing.

        PHH has agreed to promptly notify Ocwen of the receipt of any takeover proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making
the proposal. In addition, PHH has agreed to keep Ocwen informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis of any change in the status or material terms of any
takeover proposal, and provide to Ocwen (as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof) copies of all material correspondence and other written material documentation
between PHH or any of its subsidiaries and the person making the takeover proposal.

        PHH has agreed that any violation of the non-solicitation obligations by any representative of PHH or any of its subsidiaries who is (i) a director or officer of PHH or any of
its subsidiaries, (ii) a senior-level employee (i.e., a managing director (or similar title) or more senior) of any financial advisor to PHH or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) a partner
of any outside legal counsel to PHH or any of its subsidiaries will be deemed a breach by PHH.

Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Termination 

        PHH has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions as described below, neither our board of directors nor any committee thereof will (i) withdraw or propose to withdraw (or
modify or propose to modify in any manner adverse to Ocwen) our board of directors' recommendation of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby to
PHH's stockholders, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any takeover proposal, (iii) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow PHH or any of its subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any acquisition
agreement, (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle requiring PHH to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement or breach its obligations thereunder, (v) fail to recommend against any takeover proposal subject to federal tender

offer rules in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within 10 business days after the commencement of such takeover proposal, (vi) fail to include our
board of directors' recommendation of the merger agreement in this proxy statement or re-affirm such recommendation within 10 business days following Ocwen's written
request (provided that Ocwen may not make such request more than twice in connection with any takeover proposal), or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the actions in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) (we refer to any of the foregoing actions as an adverse recommendation change).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, subject to compliance with the requirements and
procedures described below, our board of directors may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal that did not result from any material breach of the non-
solicitation restrictions described above under "—No Solicitation by PHH" and certain other provisions of the merger agreement, make an adverse recommendation change or
terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to such takeover proposal if our board of directors has determined, after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such takeover proposal constitutes a superior proposal and that, following consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to
make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement is reasonably likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to PHH's stockholders under
applicable law.

        In addition, at any time prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, subject to compliance with the requirements and procedures described below, our board
of directors may make an adverse recommendation change in response to an "intervening event" (as defined below) if our board of directors determines, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failure to make an adverse recommendation change is reasonably likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to PHH's stockholders
under applicable law. For purposes of the merger agreement, an "intervening event" refers to any material development or change in circumstances relating to PHH or any of its
subsidiaries occurring or arising after the date of the merger agreement that (i) was not known by nor reasonably foreseeable to our board of directors as of the date of the merger
agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any takeover proposal; provided, however, that in no event will any of the following be deemed, either alone or in combination,
to constitute an interviewing event: (1) changes in the market price or trading volume of PHH common stock, in and of themselves, (2) the timing of any required governmental
approval, (3) the dismissal or any other resolution of the CFPB litigation (as defined below under "—CFPB Litigation") or (4) the fact that, in and of itself, PHH exceeds internal
or published projections.

        Prior to making any adverse recommendation change in response to a superior proposal or intervening event or terminating the merger agreement in order to accept a
superior proposal, PHH is required to comply with the following requirements and procedures:

• PHH must give Ocwen at least five business days' prior written notice of its intention to effect an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger
agreement, including (i) in the case of a superior proposal, the details of the terms and conditions of the superior proposal that is the basis of the proposed action,
the identity of the person making the superior proposal, and a copy of the proposed transaction agreements and other material documents (in the event of any
material change to the terms of the superior proposal, PHH is required to deliver to Ocwen an additional notice and the notice period will restart, except that the
notice period will be at least three business days rather than at least five business days) or (ii) in the case of an intervening event, the material facts and
circumstances of the intervening event; 

• during such notice period, to the extent Ocwen seeks to negotiate, PHH must negotiate, and must use reasonable best efforts to cause its financial and legal
advisors to negotiate, with Ocwen in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger

agreement so that it results in a transaction that is (i) in the case of a takeover proposal, no less favorable to PHH's stockholders than such takeover proposal or
(ii) in the case of an intervening event, enables our board of directors to determine (after consultation with its legal counsel) that failure to make an adverse
recommendation change is not reasonably likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to PHH's stockholders under applicable law; and

• following the end of the last notice period, our board of directors is required to determine, (i) in the case of a superior proposal, after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors, that the takeover proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal or (ii) in the case of an intervening event, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change is still reasonably likely to violate our board of directors' fiduciary duties to
PHH's stockholders under applicable law.

        Nothing in the merger agreement will prohibit PHH or our board of directors from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required disclosure to the
PHH's stockholders.

CFPB Litigation 

        PHH is party to a pending litigation with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which we refer to as the "CFPB," relating to an order issued by the CFPB against PHH
and certain of its affiliates on June 4, 2015. We refer to this matter as the "CFPB litigation." PHH has agreed that, from the execution of the merger agreement until the effective
time, it will (i) reasonably consult with Ocwen at regular intervals regarding the status of the CFPB litigation and in advance of any meeting with the CFPB with respect to the
CFPB litigation, (ii) provide Ocwen with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on material developments in the CFPB litigation, and (iii) consider in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by Ocwen with respect to the CFPB litigation. In addition, PHH has agreed that it will not, without Ocwen's prior consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), (a) file or otherwise commence any appeal in connection with the CFPB litigation or (b) settle or agree to settle the CFPB litigation if such
settlement (1) exceeds a specified amount, (2) imposes any restriction on Ocwen's ability to operate PHH's business (as conducted as of the date of the merger agreement) after
the effective time (excluding existing restrictions and restrictions on the PLS business or any other business that PHH no longer owns or conducts), (3) imposes any monetary
penalty or other obligation on Ocwen or its subsidiaries (excluding the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries) or (4) contains any admission of fault or any non-standard or
unusual release language.

Treatment of Existing Indebtedness 

        In connection with the merger, Ocwen will assume through the surviving corporation PHH's 7.375% Senior Notes due 2019 and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021, and either
pay off or assume PHH's existing warehouse facilities and advance receivables facility. Prior to the effective time, Ocwen will execute and deliver any supplements, amendments
or other instruments required for the assumption of the senior notes.

Stockholders' Meeting 

        PHH has agreed under the merger agreement to hold a special meeting of its stockholders to consider and take action upon approval of the merger as soon as reasonably
practicable after this proxy statement is cleared by the SEC. PHH may only adjourn, postpone or recess the special meeting in order to obtain a quorum or solicit additional votes
(so long as such meeting is not adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date on or after the outside date).

Access to Information 

        During the period prior to the effective time, upon reasonable request and notice by Ocwen and subject to applicable laws relating to exchange of information, PHH will,
and will cause its subsidiaries to, afford to Ocwen's officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives access to PHH's properties, books, certain contracts,
commitments and records, and to PHH's officers, employees, accounts, counsel and other representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of
the business of PHH and its subsidiaries.

        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the determination date for purposes of calculating PHH's adjusted net worth and available cash (see "—Material
Adverse Effect" above), PHH will deliver to Ocwen, no later than the 15th day of each month, a report containing PHH's most current estimate of its adjusted net worth and
available cash, in each case as of the last day of the full calendar month immediately preceding the date of such report. After the determination date for purposes of calculating
PHH's adjusted net worth and available cash, PHH will deliver to Ocwen, no later than the Wednesday of each calendar week, a report containing PHH most current estimate of
available cash as of the last day of the calendar week immediately preceding the date of such report.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance 

        Under the merger agreement, Ocwen has agreed to indemnify, and to cause the surviving corporation to indemnify, for a period of six years after the closing and to the
fullest extent permitted or required by applicable law, each individual who was a director or officer of PHH or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time or has served at
the request of PHH as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another entity prior to the effective time, which we refer to collectively as the "PHH indemnified
parties," with respect to all claims and liabilities (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred or arising in connection with any claim, action, investigation, suit or
proceeding, including with respect to matters existing or occurring or alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the effective time (including the merger agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated thereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the PHH indemnified party is or was an officer or director of PHH or any of its
subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of PHH or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or any act or omission by such PHH indemnified party
while serving in such capacity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time.

        Ocwen has also agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective
time in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of PHH or any of its subsidiaries as provided in their respective organizational documents or in any
indemnification, employment or other similar agreements will survive the merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six years
after the closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ocwen will cause the organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to the PHH indemnified parties than those set forth in the respective
organizational documents as of the date of the merger agreement.

        In addition, for a period of six years after the effective time, Ocwen will either cause PHH's current directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
to be maintained, or provide substitute policies of not less than the existing coverage and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals
than the policies currently maintained by PHH with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring on or before the effective time. In lieu of the foregoing, PHH may,
prior to the effective time and upon written notice to Ocwen, purchase a six-year prepaid "tail policy" for PHH's current and former directors and officers (and any individual

who becomes an officer or director of PHH prior to the effective time) who are currently covered by directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by PHH. The merger agreement provides that in no event will the aggregate annual premium payments for any continuing coverage, substitute policies or "tail
policies" exceed 250% of the annual premium paid by PHH for such insurance for the year ended December 31, 2017.

        The PHH indemnified parties are third-party beneficiaries of the provisions described above, and such individuals will have the right to enforce the provisions of the merger
agreement summarized above.

Employee Matters 

        Ocwen has agreed that for a period from the effective time through December 31, 2018, it will provide to each continuing employee of PHH and its subsidiaries with (i) an
annual base salary or base wage and target annual incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity and long-term incentive compensation) that are, in each case, no less
than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee
benefits provided to the continuing employees immediately prior to the effective time. In addition, Ocwen has agreed that from the effective time until the one year anniversary of
the closing date of the merger, Ocwen will continue to maintain or cause to be maintained, without amendment, certain of PHH's severance plans and incentive plans with respect
to the continuing employees in accordance with the terms thereof, and provide the payments and benefits specified therein.

        After the closing of the merger, Ocwen will use reasonable best efforts to cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Ocwen or the surviving corporation
or their subsidiaries in which the continuing employees are eligible to participate to (i) waive any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
such plans that are group health plans of Ocwen or its affiliates with respect to the continuing employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each continuing employee credit
for the plan year in which the effective time occurs towards applicable co-payments, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
effective time for which payment has been made, and (iii) give each continuing employee service credit for his or her employment with PHH and its subsidiaries for purposes of
vesting, level of benefits and eligibility to participate under the applicable plan, as if such service had been performed with Ocwen (except for benefit accrual under defined
benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits). In addition, after the closing
of the merger, Ocwen will provide credit to each continuing employee for accrued unused sick leave and/or accrued unused paid time off in the amount available to such
continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time, in accordance and subject to the terms of the applicable policy of PHH.

        If requested in writing by Ocwen at least 10 business days prior to the effective time (to the extent permitted by applicable law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement), PHH will cause its 401(k) plans to be terminated immediately prior to the effective time. In such event, Ocwen will permit each eligible continuing employee to, as
of the effective time, become a participant in an Ocwen 401(k) plan and make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" in cash or notes (in the case of participant
loans and to the extent permitted by Ocwen's 401(k) plan) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such
continuing employee from such PHH 401(k) plans to Ocwen's 401(k) plan.

Other Covenants and Agreements 

        The merger agreement contains additional agreements between PHH and Ocwen relating to, among other things, the following:

• notifications of certain matters, including any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement; 

• preparation of this proxy statement; 

• ensuring exemption of certain transactions in connection with the merger under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act; 

• ensuring inapplicability of state takeover statutes;

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time (notwithstanding any stockholder approval) in the
following circumstances:

• by mutual written consent of Ocwen and PHH; 

• by either Ocwen or PHH if: 

• the merger has not been consummated on or before September 27, 2018, which we refer to as the "outside date," provided that the outside date will be
extended to December 27, 2018 if the closing condition relating to the receipt of the required governmental approvals has not been satisfied on
September 27, 2018 but all other conditions described under "—Conditions to the Merger" have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the closing, capable of being satisfied on such date); provided, further, that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not
be available to a party that has breached the merger agreement and such breach was the primary cause of the failure to consummate the merger by the
outside date; 

• any permanent injunction prohibiting the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has become effective, final and
nonappealable, or any law prohibiting the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has been enacted, promulgated or
enforced by any governmental authority; provided, that the terminating party has complied in all material respects with its obligations described under "—
Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approvals"; or 

• the vote required to adopt the merger agreement is not obtained at the special meeting of PHH stockholders.

        In addition, PHH may terminate the merger agreement in the following circumstances:

• prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, in order to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal; provided
that PHH has complied in all material respects with its obligations described under "—No Solicitation by PHH" and certain procedures described under "—
Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Termination" above, and concurrently pays the termination fee to Ocwen as described under "–Termination Fee"
below; or

• there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement by Ocwen or Merger Sub, which breach would
give rise to the failure to satisfy a condition to PHH's obligation to consummate the merger, and such failure is not curable or has not been cured within the earlier
of the outside date and 30 days following PHH's written notice to Ocwen of such breach; provided that PHH will not have this right to terminate the merger
agreement if PHH is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement that would give rise to the failure to satisfy a
condition to Ocwen's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the merger.

        In addition, Ocwen may terminate the merger agreement in the following circumstances:

• prior to the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, our board of directors has made an adverse recommendation change; or 

• there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement by PHH, which breach would give rise to the
failure to satisfy a condition to Ocwen's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the merger, and such failure is not curable or has not been cured within the
earlier of the outside date and 30 days following Ocwen's written notice to PHH of such breach; provided that Ocwen will not have this right to terminate the
merger agreement if Ocwen is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement that would give rise to the failure to
satisfy a condition to PHH's obligation to consummate the merger.

        If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party to another party; provided, however, that (i) certain
provisions, including those relating to confidentiality, termination fee, governing law and jurisdiction will survive the termination and (ii) no party will be released from liabilities
arising out of any willful breach of the merger agreement or fraud.

Termination Fee 

        PHH will be required to pay a termination fee of $12,600,000 to Ocwen under the following circumstances:

• Ocwen terminates the merger agreement as a result of an adverse recommendation change by our board of directors; 

• PHH terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal; 

• (i) a third party has publicly announced and not withdrawn a takeover proposal prior to the special meeting of PHH's stockholders to vote on the approval of the
merger or the termination of the merger agreement, (ii) PHH or Ocwen terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the required PHH stockholder
approval of the merger agreement or the failure to consummate the merger on or before the outside date, or Ocwen terminates the merger agreement due to a
material breach by PHH, and (iii) within 12 months of such termination, PHH consummates a takeover proposal or enters into a definitive acquisition agreement
with respect to a takeover proposal that is subsequently consummated (solely for purpose of this provision, any reference to 20% in the definition of takeover
proposal will be deemed to refer to 50% instead); or 

• PHH or Ocwen terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the required PHH stockholder approval of the merger agreement but, at the time of
such termination, Ocwen would also have been permitted to terminate the merger agreement as a result of an adverse recommendation change by our board of
directors.

        In the event the termination fee is payable, from and after the payment of the termination fee by PHH to Ocwen, PHH will have no further liability of any kind.

Remedies; Specific Enforcement 

        The parties to the merger agreement have agreed that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
the merger agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties have agreed that the parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the
merger agreement.

Amendment of the Merger Agreement 

        At any time prior to the effective time, the merger agreement may be amended by PHH, Ocwen and Merger Sub by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties; provided, however, that after the approval of the merger by PHH's stockholders, no amendment which requires further approval of PHH's stockholders under applicable
law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE may be made without such further approval.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction 

        The merger agreement is governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws;
provided, however, that the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the mechanics of the merger and the fiduciary duties of our board of directors will be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware.

        Each party to the merger agreement has agreed to irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the
Delaware Court of Chancery is unavailable, any Delaware State court and the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purposes of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of the merger agreement or any transaction contemplated thereby.

PROPOSAL 2—ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
(MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSAL) 

General 

        As required by Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are providing our stockholders with a separate advisory (non-
binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that arise out of or are based upon the merger and the merger
agreement, as described in the table entitled "Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company's Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger"
under "Proposal 1—The Approval of the Merger Proposal—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers," including the footnotes to the table and related narrative
discussion, or the "Merger-Related Compensation Proposal".

        Our board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company approve the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger on the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled "Proposal 1—The Approval of the Merger Proposal—Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Our Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger," including the footnotes to the
table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."

        The vote on the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may
vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on us or our board of directors. Accordingly, if the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders.
Although the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is only advisory in nature and is not binding on us or our board of directors, we intend to review the voting results with our
board of directors and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of our board of directors so that such voting results may be taken into consideration in connection with
executive compensation decisions related to the merger.

Required Vote 

        The above resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers based on or that otherwise relates to the merger and the merger agreement on an advisory
basis requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast at the special meeting, provided that a quorum is present. This means that, of the shares present in person or by
proxy at the special meeting, a majority must vote in favor of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal in order for the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal to be
approved. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the determination of this proposal.

Recommendation of our Board of Directors 

        Our board of directors unanimously recommends that the Company's stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

PROPOSAL 3—THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL 

General 

        If, at the special meeting, the number of shares of our common stock, present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and voting in favor of the approval of the
Merger Proposal and/or the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal under our charter and Maryland law, we intend to move to adjourn
the special meeting in order to enable our board of directors to solicit additional proxies in respect of approval of the Merger Proposal and/or the Merger-Related Compensation
Proposal, which we refer to herein as, the "Adjournment Proposal". In that event, we will ask our stockholders to vote only upon the Adjournment Proposal, and not upon of the
Merger Proposal or the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

        With respect to the Adjournment Proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by our board of directors to vote in favor of granting
discretionary authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the special meeting to another date, time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies. If the stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional
time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously voted.

Required Vote 

        The affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast at the special meeting is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal, provided that a quorum is present. This means
that, of the shares present in person or by proxy at the special meeting, a majority must vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal in order for the Adjournment Proposal to be
approved. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the determination of this proposal.

Recommendation of our Board of Directors 

        Our board of directors believes that if the number of shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and voting in favor of the approval
of either of the Merger Approval and/or the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal, is insufficient to approve such proposals, it is in the best interests of our stockholders to
enable us, for a limited period of time, to continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional votes in favor of the approval of both the Merger Proposal and Merger-
Related Compensation Proposal to bring about the approval of the proposals. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that the Company's stockholders vote
"FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 

        Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and any persons that beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our
equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC and the NYSE. To our knowledge, based solely upon our review of
Forms 3 and 4 that have been filed with the SEC and written representations from our executive officers and directors that no Form 5s were required, we believe that all of our
executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions
during 2017.

MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK 

        Shares of our common stock are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "PHH". The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our Common stock for the
periods indicated as reported by the NYSE:

        As of April 3, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, there were 5,132 holders of record of our Common stock.

        The closing sale price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 26, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, was $8.84 per share.
On April 26, 2018, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was made available to our stockholders, the closing sale price of our common stock on the NYSE
was $10.68. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common stock in connection with voting your shares.

Dividends 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends without the prior consent of Ocwen. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our
Common stock since we began operating as an independent, publicly traded company in 2005.

        The provisions of our debt arrangements, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries and other legal requirements and regulatory constraints may restrict us from
making such share-related payments in the future. Limitations and restrictions on our ability to make share-related payments include but are not limited to maintaining
compliance with the financial covenants contained in certain

89

directors. These restricted stock units may not be sold or otherwise transferred for value, and directors have no right to acquire the shares underlying the
restricted stock units prior to the date of their termination of service on our board of directors.

fiscal month beginning after December 31, 2017; and (ii) a ratio of unsecured indebtedness to tangible net worth of no greater than 1.25 to 1.

        In addition, we are limited in the amount of share-related payments that can be distributed due to capital that is required to be maintained at our subsidiaries. The amount of
intercompany dividends, share-related payments and other fund transfers that certain of our subsidiaries can declare or distribute to us or to other consolidated subsidiaries (and
ultimately to us) is limited due to provisions of our subsidiaries' debt arrangements, capital requirements, and other legal requirements and regulatory constraints. The aggregate
restricted net assets that are required to be maintained at our subsidiaries totaled $102 million as of December 31, 2017.

        We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies on behalf of our board of directors. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf without compensation
in person or by telephone, facsimile or electronically through the Internet, as described above. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, to solicit
proxies in connection with the special meeting. We have also engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxies. We will reimburse brokerage
firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending our proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock as of the record date.

charge, excluding any exhibits to those documents unless the exhibit is specifically incorporated by reference into those documents.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is consummated, we will not have public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meeting of stockholders. However, if the merger is
not consummated or if we are otherwise required to do so under applicable law, we would hold a 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Proposals from stockholders are given
careful consideration by us in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, or "Rule 14a-8." If a 2018 annual meeting is held, we will provide all stockholders with the
opportunity, under certain circumstances and consistent with our by-laws and the rules of the SEC, to participate in the governance of the Company by submitting stockholder
proposals that they believe merit consideration at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. To enable management to analyze and respond to proposals that stockholders wish to
have included in the proxy statement and proxy card for that meeting, our by-laws, consistent with Rule 14a-8, require that any such proposal be received by us in writing no later
than the tenth day following the public announcement of the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Any stockholder proposal submitted must also be in compliance
with our by-laws and must contain specified information about each nominee or the proposed business and the stockholder making the nomination or proposal. Pursuant to our
by-laws, any stockholder proposal or director nomination for that meeting that is submitted outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 will be considered "untimely" unless it is received
by us no later than the tenth day following the public announcement of the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.

        Proxies solicited by our board of directors for the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders may confer discretionary authority to vote on any untimely stockholder proposals or
director nominations without express direction from stockholders giving such proxies. All stockholder proposals and director nominations must be addressed to the attention of
our Corporate Secretary at PHH Corporation, 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mount Laurel, New Jersey 08054. The chairman of our annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to
acknowledge the introduction of any stockholder proposal or director nomination not made in compliance with the foregoing procedures.

HOUSEHOLDING OF SPECIAL MEETING MATERIALS 

        Stockholders that share the same address may not receive separate copies of proxy materials, unless we have received contrary instructions from such stockholders. This
practice is known as "householding" and is intended to reduce the printing and postage costs associated with mailing duplicative sets of proxy materials to stockholders sharing
the same address. If you are receiving multiple sets of our proxy materials and wish to receive only one set in the future, or if you are currently only receiving one set of our
proxy materials and wish to receive separate sets of proxy materials for you and the other stockholders sharing your address, please notify us or your bank, broker or other
nominee by indicating your preference on the enclosed proxy card or vote instruction form. We will deliver an additional copy of our proxy materials to you, without charge,
upon written request sent to Investor Relations at PHH Corporation, 3000 Leadenhall Road, Mount Laurel, New Jersey 08054. Our proxy materials are also available on our
website at http://www.phh.com.

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $11.00, without interest (such amount, the
"Merger Consideration").

                          (b)        No later than the second Business Day after the Determination Date, the Company will deliver to Parent its estimates of the Company Net Worth and
Available Cash. In the event Parent disagrees with the Company's calculation of either of such estimates, the Company and Parent will cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than two Business Days (the "Resolution Period")) following the Company's delivery of its estimates and agree on
the amount of the Company Net Worth and/or Available Cash, which shall be treated as such for purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent will not have the
right to dispute the Company's legal analysis in determining the amount of cash that is distributable in accordance with Section 2-311 or any other applicable provisions of the
MGCL, including whether or not any specific cash is available for distribution; and provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt Parent and Merger Sub may dispute the
actual calculation of Available Cash. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the Company Net Worth and/or Available Cash within the Resolution
Period, the Parties shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) after the end of the Resolution Period submit the disputed items to Ernst & Young LLP or, if such
firm is not available, a mutually acceptable nationally recognized accounting firm that has not provided material services to either the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates in the preceding three years (the "Independent Accountant"). The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountant to render a decision to the disputed items
as soon as practicable (and in any event within 10 days) after the submission to it of the disputed items. Each of the Company and Parent shall make available to the Independent
Accountant all information, records, data and working papers as may be reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant in connection with the resolution of the disputed
items; provided that if the estimates of the Company Net Worth and/or Available Cash delivered by the Company in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 3.1(b) was
calculated as of the date in clause (b) of the definition of Applicable Month End, the Company will update such calculation to reflect the more recent date in clause (a) of such
definition and deliver such updated calculation to Parent and to the Independent Accountant as promptly as practicable, and the determination of the Independent Accountant
hereunder shall be made with respect to such updated calculation (unless Parent agrees with such updated calculation, in which case a determination by the Independent
Accountant shall not be required). The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, and not by independent investigation, regarding the disputed items and shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must
be made in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the range of values established for such amount as
determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by the Company and by Parent. Except for any dispute to the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms
of this Agreement, the determination of the Independent Accountant concerning any item in dispute shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties without further right of
appeal. The cost of the Independent Accountant in connection with its services pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) shall be shared equally by the Company and Parent.

                          (c)         The Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, all certificates
representing common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

                          (d)        At the Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company as treasury stock (other than shares in a Company Plan) or owned by
Parent or Merger Sub (other than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

                          Section 3.2    Cancellation of Company Common Stock.     At the Effective Time, all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, upon conversion
pursuant to Section 3.1(a), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist. Certificates representing such shares of Company
Common Stock, if any, prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock
were converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(a). Holders of Company Common Stock (excluding those shares subject to Section 3.1(d)) as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of the Company, other than rights to receive the Merger Consideration provided
under this Article III.

                          (a)    Treatment of Options.     At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans
(each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration (over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to
the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

                          (b)    Company Time-Based RSUs.     At the Effective Time (i) any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (whether cash-settled or
equity-settled) subject to only time-based or service-based vesting requirements under the Company Stock Plans (a "Company Time-Based RSU") shall, automatically and

Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; provided, that, with respect to any Company Time-
Based RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without triggering
a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement that
will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

settled or equity-settled) subject to performance-based or market-based vesting requirements under the Company Stock Plans (a "Company Performance-Based RSU" and,
together with the Company Time-Based RSUs, the "Company RSUs"), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder

Compensation Committee") multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; provided, that, with respect
to any Company Performance-Based RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the
Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company
Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

share of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans (a "Company Time-Based RCU") shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, accelerate in full, and (ii) each Company Time-Based RCU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and

repurchase or other lapse restrictions pursuant to an award granted under the Company Stock Plans (a "Company Restricted Share") shall, automatically and without any required

thereof, be cancelled and converted automatically, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right of the holder to receive the Merger Consideration,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect thereto.

                          (f)    Company Actions.     At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, Company Board and the Company Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company Time-Based RCUs and Company
Restricted Shares (collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") pursuant to this Section 3.3. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person

                          Section 3.4    Surrender and Payment.

                          (b)         Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, Merger Consideration
in respect of the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such holder's Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

                          (c)        If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

                          (d)        At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of Company Capital Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with, the procedures set forth in this Article III.

                          (e)        Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to (a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of Parent, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the Acquirer Parties, the Company, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

                          (f)        The Paying Agent will invest all cash included in the Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash will be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, and, in any such case, no such instrument will have a maturity exceeding three
months, and that no such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Article III. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 3.4(e). To the extent that there are

hereby, Parent will promptly replace or restore the portion of the Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Fund will not be used for any purpose other than the foregoing.

                          Section 3.5    Adjustments.     

                          (a)        If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements), the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

                          (b)        If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company pays any cash dividend (subject to Parent's consent right
pursuant to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, if any), the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted such that the aggregate amount of consideration payable in respect of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company Time-Based RCUs and Company Restricted Shares pursuant to this Article III will be reduced by
the aggregate amount of such cash dividend paid to holders of Company Common Stock.

                          Section 3.6    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

                          Section 3.7    Withholding.     Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, the Paying Agent, and the Rights Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

                          Section 3.8    Dissenter's Rights.     In accordance with Section 3-202(c)(1) of the MGCL and the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, no dissenters' or
appraisal rights will be available to stockholders with respect to the Merger.

Merger Consideration at the Closing and to satisfy the other obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective subsidiaries due and payable upon the Closing. In no event

of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) will be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts, including
contingent and other liabilities, is greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as the mature).

                          Section 7.3    Access to Information; Confidentiality.     

                          (a)        Upon reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the Acquirer Parties access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request.
During the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent (i) if prior to the Determination Date, no later than the 15th day of each month, a report
containing the Company's most current estimate of the Company Net Worth and the Available Cash, in each case as of the last day of the full calendar month immediately
preceding the date of such report, and (ii) if following the Determination Date, no later than the Wednesday of each calendar week, a report containing the Company's most
current estimate of the Available Cash as of the last day of the calendar week immediately preceding the date of such report. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, violate any contract or agreement or
contravene any Law; and in any such event, the Parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

                          (b)        All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the provisions of the letter agreement entered into between the
Company and Parent, dated as of April 28, 2016 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

                          (c)        No investigation by any of the Parties or their respective representatives shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the others set forth herein.

                          Section 7.4    No Solicitation by the Company; the Company Board Recommendation.     

                          (a)        Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.4, the Company shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries or any of its
or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, controlled Affiliates and representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys or accountants retained by it or
any of its Affiliates) (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate
(including by way of providing information) any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way
with any Person (whether or not a Person making a Company Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend

any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Company Takeover Proposal (an "Acquisition
Agreement"), (v) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
breach its obligations hereunder, or (vi) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

                          (b)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal, which did not result from any material
breach of this Section 7.4, the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 7.4(g), prior to (but not after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3-105 of the MGCL, contact the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal to ascertain facts and/or clarify terms for
the sole purpose of understanding such Company Takeover Proposal, and, to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith (and following consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors) that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Company Proposal, take any action described
in clauses (x) and (y) below: (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives and any financing sources) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any material non-public information provided under this clause has
previously been provided to the Acquirer Parties or is provided to the Acquirer Parties substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such
Person's Representatives and any financing sources); provided, that the Company shall within 24 hours provide Parent with any information with respect to the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries provided to such Person which was not previously provided to Parent (or its representatives). The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall terminate, waive, amend, modify or fail to enforce any existing standstill or confidentiality obligations owed by any Person to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case except to the extent necessary to permit the Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted to take under this Section 7.4(b) in full compliance with such provision;
provided, that the Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Subsidiaries) shall have the right to waive any such standstill obligation to the extent necessary to permit a Person
otherwise covered by such standstill to submit a confidential unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board. For purposes of clarification, the
taking of any of the actions contemplated by clause (x) or (y) of this Section 7.4(b) shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

                          (c)        Except as set forth in Section 7.4(d), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent), or

advisable, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (D) enter

its obligations hereunder, (E) subject to Section 7.4(h), fail to recommend against any Company Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within 10 Business Days after the commencement of such Company Takeover Proposal, (F) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or re-affirm such Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days following Parent's written request
(provided that Parent may not make such request more than twice in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal) or (ii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (each
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change").

                          (d)        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may (subject to the requirements of Section 7.4(f)), prior to (but not after) the adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3-105 of the MGCL, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or, to the extent provided and subject to the conditions contained in Section 9.1(f), terminate this Agreement in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that such unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal and following consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement until after the fifth Business Day (the "Superior
Proposal Notice Period") following Parent's receipt of written notice (a "Company Notice of Superior Proposal") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to take such action, including the details of the terms and conditions of any Superior Company Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board
and the identity of the party making such Superior Company Proposal, and, if applicable, shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of all of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements and any other material documents provided by, or material correspondence with, the party making such Superior Company Proposal, including the then-
current form of the definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such
Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Superior Proposal and trigger a new Superior Proposal Notice Period, except that any such new Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall be three Business Days instead of five Business Days). The Company Board may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
respect of a Superior Company Proposal if any such Superior Company Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of this Section 7.4.

                          (e)         In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may (subject to the requirements of Section 7.4(f)), prior to
(but not after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3-105 of the MGCL, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business Day (the "Intervening Event
Notice Period") following Parent's receipt of written notice (a "Company Notice of Intervening Event") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to
take such action, including the material facts and circumstances of the Company Intervening Event.

                          (f)        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may not (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(d) unless at the end of the last Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors) that the Company Takeover Proposal (after giving effect to any amendments thereto) continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal, or (ii) make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 7.4(e) unless at the end of the last Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law. Further, in determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.4(d) or Section 7.4(e), the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response
to a Company Notice of Superior Proposal, Company Notice of Intervening Event or otherwise; provided, that if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period or Intervening Event Notice Period (as applicable), negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent also seeks to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that this Agreement results in a
transaction that (A) in the case of a Company Takeover Proposal, is no less favorable to the stockholders of the Company than such Company Takeover Proposal that would be
deemed to constitute a Superior Company Proposal in the absence of such adjustments or (B) in the case of a Company Intervening Event, enables the Company Board to
determine (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is not reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; it being understood and agreed that, in the event Parent agrees to make such adjustments as set forth in
clause (A) and (B), as applicable, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made. The Company agrees that any violation of this Section 7.4 by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is (i) a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a senior-level employee (i.e., a managing
director (or similar title) or more senior) of any financial advisor to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) a partner of any outside legal counsel to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this Section 7.4 by the Company.

Parent orally of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of
the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis (and in no event
later than 24 hours from the occurrence or existence of any material event, fact or circumstance) of any change in the status or material terms of any Company Takeover
Proposal, and (y) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all material correspondence and other written material documentation
exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Company Takeover Proposal.

                          (h)        Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required disclosure to the
Company's stockholders; provided, that any such statement that would be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be in accordance with Section 7.4(d) and
Section 7.4(e).

                          (i)        For purposes of this Agreement:

             "Company Intervening Event" means any material development or change in circumstances relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occurring
or arising after the date of this Agreement that (i) was not known by nor reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) does not relate to or involve any Company Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that in no event shall any of the following be deemed, either alone or in
combination, to constitute a Company Intervening Event: (A) changes in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock, in and of
themselves, (B) the timing of any Required Governmental Approval, (C) the dismissal or any other resolution of the CFPB Litigation or (D) the fact that, in and of
itself, the Company exceeds internal or published projections.

             "Company Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (iv) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company,

party (or, in a parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the voting power of the Company or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its legal and financial advisors) (i) to be superior to the holders of Company Common Stock from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by thus Agreement (taking into account any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this
Agreement) including the Merger (including the Merger Consideration), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Person making
the proposal (including all financial, regulatory, legal conditions to consummation and other aspects of such proposal), and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is not a condition to closing.

                          Section 7.5    Public Announcements.     Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other written public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and will not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except with respect to any press release or other public statements made or proposed to be made
(a) by the Company in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action pursuant thereto (provided that such
release or statement is made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), or by Parent in response thereto, (b) in connection with any dispute regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (c) in any periodic reports filed with the SEC or in any investor presentation or other written communication to the extent such statements are
generally consistent with prior public statements regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that were issued following consultation with the other Party, or (d) as
a Party may reasonably conclude may be required by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. Parent and the Company agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will

                          Section 7.6    Notification of Certain Matters.     Subject to Applicable Law, Parent will give prompt notice to the Company and the Company will give prompt
notice to Parent of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event whose occurrence or failure to occur would cause (a) any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (b) a material failure of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided,

                          Section 7.7    Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.     

                          (a)        Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any indemnification, employment or other similar agreements of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six years after the Closing Date, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties (as
defined below) than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the respective certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company of any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person
(all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements ("Losses"), incurred or arising in connection with any claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, regulatory, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring or alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person or any
act or omission by such Company Indemnified Party while serving in such capacity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law.

                          (b)        In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is
not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns undertakes any complete or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then, and in each such case, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or in the case
of any event referred to in clause (ii), Parent, will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

                          (c)         For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
(ii) provide substitute polices for the Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective
Time) who are currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in either case, of not less than the amount of existing coverage and have other terms and from carriers not less favorable to the insured persons than
the directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any
one policy year more than 250% of the annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ended December 31, 2017 (such 250% amount, the "Maximum
Amount"), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 7.7 it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years
within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date, the Company may, upon prior written notice to Parent, purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for
the Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time) who are currently (or prior to
the Effective Time become) covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company. In the event the Company
purchases such tail coverage, the Surviving Corporation will cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section 7.7(c).

                          (d)        The provisions of this Section 7.7 (i) will survive consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

                          Section 7.8    Takeover Laws.     The Parties hereto and their respective boards of directors or other governing bodies will (i) use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) if any
state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

communicated or made known to the Company's senior management or the Company Board and shall not have been withdrawn or repudiated prior to such Company Stockholder
Meeting (in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii)) or prior to the termination of this Agreement (in the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or Section 9.1(b)(i)) by the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal, (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (I) Section 9.1(b)(iii),
(II) Section 9.1(d) or (III) Section 9.1(b)(i) and (C) within 12 months of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Acquisition Agreement to consummate a
Company Takeover Proposal (provided that such Company Takeover Proposal is subsequently consummated) or a Company Takeover Proposal is consummated; provided,
however, that for purposes of this Section 9.3(b)(iii) only, each reference to "20%" in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%";

this Agreement pursuant to a provision that would give rise to a Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.3(b)(ii)), in which case this Agreement shall be deemed
terminated pursuant to such provision.

                                        (v)        Any Company Termination Fee due under this Section 9.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above,

                          (c)        The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in Section 9.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 9.3(b) does not constitute a penalty.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 9.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit, action or other
proceeding that results in a judgment in its favor for such payment, the Company shall also pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest from the date such payment is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such payment.

                          (d)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event the Company fails to effect the Closing or otherwise breaches this Agreement or
fails to perform hereunder, then, except for an injunction or an order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 10.6, the Acquirer Parties'
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective, direct or
indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates, employees, agents, other Representatives or
assignees (such Persons collectively the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Article IX and collect, if due, the Company
Termination Fee, and upon payment of such amounts in accordance with this Section 9.3, (A) no Company Related Party shall have any further Liability or obligation relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (B) none of the (i) Acquirer Parties, and
(ii) any of their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates, employees,
agents, other Representatives or assignees (such Persons referenced in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively the "Acquirer Related Parties") shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
Claim against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and (C) Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any legal proceedings pending in connection with this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent maintained by an Acquirer Party or another Acquirer Related Party against the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Company Related
Party, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly following the payment of any such amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Acquirer Parties be
(x) entitled to collect the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (y) permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation to
close contemplated by Section 10.6 and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee.

of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

                          Section 10.2    Amendment and Waiver.     

                          (a)        This Agreement may not be modified or amended and no waiver, consent or approval by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may be
granted except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by, in the case of any modification or amendment, each Party to this Agreement or, in the case of any waiver,
consent or approval, such Party, except that following satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a), there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof

there be any amendment or change not permitted under Applicable Law. No failure or delay on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in exercising any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

                          (c)        Waiver by any Party of any default by any other Party of any provision hereof shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or
other default, nor shall it prejudice the rights of such other Party.

                          (a)        This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any rights, interests and obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of
each of the other Parties and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.

                          (b)        Except (i) as provided in Section 7.7 or (ii) for the provisions of Article III (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders
of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time), the Acquirer Parties and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set
forth herein, except that the Non-Recourse Parties are made third-party beneficiaries to Section 10.4(b), Section 10.7 and Section 10.11.

                          Section 10.5    Counterparts.     This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which

this Agreement were not performed (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 10.7 below, without proof of actual
damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a

                          (a)        This Agreement (other than Articles II and III and the provisions relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board) and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (other than Articles II and III and the provisions relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board) shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts-of-law principles of such State. Articles II and III of this Agreement and
the provisions of this Agreement relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out of, or related to such provisions,
will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to the conflicts-of-law principles of such State.

                          (b)        Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purposes of any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise (and
agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the Parties further agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Person's respective address set forth
above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in
the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any
such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                          (c)        EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND
ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

incurred by any Party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby ("Expenses") shall be paid
by the Party incurring such expense whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that Expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement
and in connection with notices or other filings with any Governmental Authorities under any Laws shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

ANNEX B 

Opinion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC 

February 27, 2018

Board of Directors
PHH Corporation
3000 Leadenhall Road
Mt. Laurel, New Jersey 08054

Board of Directors:

You have asked us to advise you in your capacity as the Board of Directors of PHH Corporation ("PHH") with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of
the common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("PHH Common Stock"), of PHH of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be received by such holders pursuant to the
terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to be entered into among Ocwen Financial Corporation ("Ocwen"), POMS Corp, a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Ocwen ("Merger Sub"), and PHH. The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into PHH (the "Merger"), with
PHH as the surviving entity of the Merger, pursuant to which each outstanding share of PHH Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash (the
"Merger Consideration"), subject to certain adjustments (as to which we express no opinion) specified in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are set
forth more fully in the Merger Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed an execution version, provided to us on February 27, 2018, of the Merger Agreement and certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to PHH. We also have reviewed certain other information relating to PHH provided to or discussed with us by the management of PHH, including
financial forecasts and estimates relating to PHH provided to or discussed with us by the management of PHH, and we have met with the management of PHH to discuss the
businesses and prospects of PHH. We also have considered certain financial and stock market data of PHH, and we have compared that data with similar data for companies with
publicly traded equity securities in businesses we deemed relevant. We also considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial,
economic and market criteria which we deemed relevant.

In connection with our review, we have not independently verified any of the foregoing information and, with your consent, we have assumed and relied upon such information
being complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates for PHH (including, without limitation, as to PHH's projected net worth
and available and distributable cash) that we have been directed to utilize in our analyses, the management of PHH has advised us, and we have assumed, with your consent, that
such financial forecasts and estimates have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management
as to the future financial performance of PHH and the other matters covered thereby and are appropriate for our use and reliance for purposes of our analyses and this opinion.

without independent verification, upon the assessments of the management of PHH as to, among other things, (i) the pending sale of PHH's mortgage servicing rights and other
asset sales and dispositions, and the exiting of certain businesses, reorganizations, restructurings and other corporate transactions undertaken by PHH (collectively, the
"Disposition Transactions"), including with respect to the timing thereof and expected amount of distributable cash therefrom, (ii) the potential impact on PHH of certain market,
competitive, cyclical and other trends in and prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the residential mortgage and
real estate markets and related credit and financial markets, including with respect to interest rates and conditions in the housing market, (iii) the annual portfolio growth and
recapture rates of PHH and (iv) recent events and other aspects relating to PHH's key clients, vendors and other commercial relationships. We have assumed, with your consent,
that there will be no developments with respect to any such matters or any adjustments to the Merger Consideration that would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or
this opinion.

In connection with our opinion, we have not been requested to make, and we have not made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent,
accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of PHH or any other entity, nor have we been furnished for purposes of our analyses or this opinion with any such evaluations
or appraisals, and our analyses should not be construed as such. We are not experts in the evaluation of, and we express no opinion with respect to, loan portfolios or individual
credit files or the adequacy or sufficiency of allowances for credit losses with respect to loans or any other matters. We also have not been requested to make, and we have not
made, an evaluation of the solvency or fair value of PHH under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters or any potential or actual
litigation, regulatory action or governmental investigation or possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which PHH or any other entity is or may be a party or is
or may be subject or any reserves therefor, and we have assumed, with your consent, that the outcome of such matters would not be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or
this opinion.

We have assumed, with your consent, that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third-party consents, approvals, agreements or waivers in connection with the Merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on
the Merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to our analyses or this opinion and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement thereof. Representatives of PHH have advised us, and we also have assumed, with your consent, that the terms of the Merger Agreement, when executed, will conform
in all material respects to the terms reflected in the execution version reviewed by us. We are not expressing any opinion with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or
similar matters, including, without limitation, any opinion with respect to changes in, or the impact of, tax laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies on the
Merger, PHH or any other participant in the Merger, and have assumed that PHH has or will obtain such advice or opinions from appropriate professional sources, and we have
relied, with your consent, upon the assessments of representatives of PHH as to such matters.

Our opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof, of the Merger Consideration (to the extent expressly specified herein), without
regard to individual circumstances of specific holders with respect to any rights or aspects which may distinguish such holders or the securities of PHH held by such holders, and

Consideration, the financial or other terms or consequences of any Disposition Transaction or related distributions or any post-closing reorganizations or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding to be entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by the Merger or otherwise. In addition, our opinion does not address the fairness
of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or other consideration to any officers, directors, employees or securityholders of any party to the

have received and would expect to receive compensation, including, during the past two years, having acted or acting as financial advisor to PHH in connection with a series of
strategic alternative transactions, including certain asset sales or other disposition transactions, and as dealer manager for a share repurchase and a senior notes tender offer. As
you also are aware, we and our affiliates in the past have provided and currently are providing investment banking and other financial services to Ocwen, for which we and our
