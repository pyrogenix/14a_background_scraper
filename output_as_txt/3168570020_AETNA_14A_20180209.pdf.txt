MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

February 9, 2018

Dear CVS Health Stockholders and Aetna Shareholders:

On behalf of the boards of directors of CVS Health and Aetna, we are pleased to enclose the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the
merger of Aetna with a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement entered into by CVS Health and Aetna on
December 3, 2017.

If the merger is completed, Aetna shareholders immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be entitled to receive $145.00 in
cash and 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock for each Aetna common share held by them, as described in more detail in the
accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus under the heading “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.” Based on the closing
price of a share of CVS Health common stock on February 8, 2018, the most recent trading day prior to the date of the accompanying joint proxy
statement/prospectus for which this information was available, the merger consideration represented approximately $204.11 in value per Aetna common
share. The value of the consideration to be received by Aetna shareholders will fluctuate with changes in the price of the shares of CVS Health common
stock. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for shares of CVS Health common stock and Aetna common shares. Shares of CVS Health
common stock and Aetna common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbols “CVS” and “AET”, respectively.

In connection with the merger, CVS Health stockholders are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of CVS Health to be
held on March 13, 2018 at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, located at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time,
and Aetna shareholders are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Aetna to be held on March 13, 2018 at the offices of
Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, located at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. We cannot complete the merger and the merger consideration
will not be paid unless (i) CVS Health stockholders approve the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger and (ii) Aetna
shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger requires
the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast thereon at the special meeting of stockholders of CVS Health. Approval and
adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Aetna common shares
entitled to vote thereon.

At the special meeting of the stockholders of CVS Health, CVS Health stockholders will be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to approve the issuance
of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger and (ii) a proposal to approve the adjournment from time to time of the CVS Health special
meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the CVS Health special meeting, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, to approve the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger.

CVS Health’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger and the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of CVS Health and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that CVS Health stockholders vote (i) “FOR” the approval of the
issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger and (ii) “FOR” the approval of the adjournment from time to time of the CVS
Health special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the CVS Health special meeting, or
any adjournment or postponement thereof, to approve the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger.

At the special meeting of the shareholders of Aetna, Aetna shareholders will be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement, (ii) a proposal to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Aetna special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there
are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, and (iii) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Aetna to its named
executive officers in connection with the merger.

Aetna’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (including the merger) are fair to and in the best interests of Aetna and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Aetna
shareholders vote (i) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, (ii) “FOR” the approval of the adjournment from time to
time of the Aetna special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and (iii) “FOR” the proposal to approve, on
an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Aetna to its named executive officers in connection
with the merger.

CVS Health expects to issue approximately 280 million shares of its common stock to Aetna shareholders in the merger. Based on the number of
shares of CVS Health common stock outstanding as of February 5, 2018, and the number of Aetna common shares outstanding as of February 5, 2018,
immediately following completion of the merger, CVS Health stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately 78% of
the outstanding shares of CVS Health common stock and former Aetna shareholders are expected to own approximately 22% of the outstanding shares
of CVS Health common stock.

The accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus provides important information regarding the CVS Health and Aetna special meetings and a
detailed description of the merger agreement, the merger, the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger, the adjournment proposals
and the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Aetna to its named executive
officers in connection with the merger. We urge you to read carefully the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus (and any documents
incorporated by reference into the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus). Please pay particular attention to the section entitled “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 62 of the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus. You can also obtain information about CVS Health and
Aetna from documents that CVS Health and Aetna previously have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 167 of

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of CVS Health Corporation, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as CVS Health, or a shareholder of Aetna Inc., which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Aetna, may have
regarding the merger, the stock issuance, the Aetna adjournment proposal, the CVS Health adjournment proposal, the Aetna compensation advisory
proposal and the special meetings as well as brief answers to those questions. You are urged to read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including all documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and its annexes, in their entirety because this section may
not provide all of the information that is important to you with respect to the merger, the stock issuance, the Aetna adjournment proposal, the CVS
Health adjournment proposal, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal and the special meetings. Additional important information is contained in the
annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this document and why am I being asked to vote on the merger agreement?
 

A: CVS Health and Aetna have agreed to a merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the merger, pursuant to which
Aetna will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health and will no longer be a publicly traded corporation. In order to complete the merger,
CVS Health stockholders must vote to approve the issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock to Aetna shareholders in the merger, which
issuance is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the stock issuance, and Aetna shareholders must vote to approve and adopt the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 3, 2017, among CVS Health, Aetna and Hudson Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CVS Health that is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Merger Sub. This merger agreement, as it may be amended
from time to time, is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the merger agreement.

Aetna is holding a special meeting of shareholders, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Aetna special meeting, in
order to obtain the shareholder approval necessary to approve and adopt the merger agreement. Approval and adoption of the merger
agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Aetna common shares entitled to vote thereon.
Aetna shareholders will also be asked to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Aetna special meeting if necessary to solicit additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Aetna adjournment proposal, and to approve, on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Aetna to its named executive officers, who are referred to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the named executive officers, in connection with the merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Aetna compensation advisory proposal. It is important that Aetna’s shareholders vote their Aetna common shares
on each of these matters, regardless of the number of shares owned.

CVS Health is holding a special meeting of stockholders, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health special
meeting, in order to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to approve the stock issuance. Approval of the stock issuance requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast thereon at the CVS Health special meeting. CVS Health stockholders will also be
asked to approve the adjournment from time to time of the CVS Health special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the CVS Health special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, to approve the stock issuance, which
is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health adjournment proposal. It is important that CVS Health’s shareholders
vote their shares of CVS Health common stock on each of these matters, regardless of the number of shares owned.

Table of Contents

This document is being delivered to you as both a joint proxy statement of Aetna and CVS Health and a prospectus of CVS Health in connection
with the merger and the stock issuance. It is the proxy statement by which Aetna’s board of directors is soliciting proxies from Aetna shareholders
to vote at the Aetna special meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Aetna special meeting, on the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement, the approval of the Aetna adjournment proposal and the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Aetna
compensation advisory proposal. It is also the proxy statement by which CVS Health’s board of directors is soliciting proxies from CVS Health
stockholders to vote at the CVS Health special meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the CVS Health special meeting, on the
approval of the stock issuance and the approval of the CVS Health adjournment proposal. In addition, this document is the prospectus of CVS
Health pursuant to which CVS Health will issue shares of CVS Health common stock to Aetna shareholders as part of the merger consideration.

 
Q: Is my vote important?
 

A: Yes, your vote is very important. For Aetna shareholders, an abstention from voting or a failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. If you hold your Aetna common shares through a broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record and you do not give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, that broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record will not be able to vote your shares on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and your failure to give those
instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. Aetna’s board of directors
unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and CVS Health’s board of
directors unanimously recommends that CVS Health stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the stock issuance.

 
Q: What will happen in the merger?
 

A: In the merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Aetna. Aetna will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CVS Health following completion of the merger and will no longer be a publicly traded corporation.

 
Q: What will Aetna shareholders receive in the merger?
 

A: If the merger is completed, each Aetna common share automatically will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $145.00 in cash
without interest thereon, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the cash consideration, and 0.8378 of a share of CVS
Health common stock, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the share consideration. The cash consideration and the
share consideration are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the merger consideration. Each Aetna shareholder will
be entitled to receive cash for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that the Aetna shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive
in the merger.

Based on the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the NYSE, on October 25, 2017, the last trading day prior to news reports of a potential transaction between CVS Health
and Aetna, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the unaffected date, the merger consideration represented approximately
$208.28 in value for each Aetna common share. Based on the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on the NYSE on February 8,
2018, the most recent trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for which this information was available, the merger
consideration represented approximately $204.11 in value for each Aetna common share. Because CVS Health will issue a fixed fraction of a
share of CVS Health common stock in exchange for each Aetna common share, the value of the share consideration will depend on the
market price of shares of CVS Health common stock at the time the merger is completed. The market price of shares of CVS Health
common stock when

Table of Contents

Aetna shareholders receive those shares after the merger is completed could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of
shares of CVS Health common stock on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Aetna special meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by Aetna shareholders, the stock issuance is not approved by CVS Health stockholders or if
the merger is not completed for any other reason, Aetna shareholders will not receive any payment for their Aetna common shares in connection
with the merger. Instead, Aetna will remain an independent public company and its common shares will continue to be listed and traded on the
NYSE. If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Aetna may be required to pay CVS Health a termination fee of
$2.1 billion, and if the merger agreement is terminated under certain other circumstances, CVS Health may be required to pay Aetna a termination
fee of $2.1 billion. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 205 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
for a more detailed discussion of the termination fees.

 
Q: What are Aetna shareholders being asked to vote on?
 

A: Aetna shareholders are being asked to vote on the following three proposals:
 

 •  to approve and adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus;
 

 •  to approve the Aetna adjournment proposal; and
 

 •  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

The approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders is a condition to the obligations of Aetna and CVS Health to complete
the merger. Neither the approval of the Aetna adjournment proposal nor the approval of the Aetna compensation advisory proposal is a condition
to the obligations of Aetna or CVS Health to complete the merger.

 
Q: What are CVS Health stockholders being asked to vote on?
 

A: CVS Health stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve the stock issuance; and
 

 •  to approve the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

The approval of the stock issuance by CVS Health stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Aetna and CVS Health to complete the merger.
The approval of the CVS Health adjournment proposal is not a condition to the obligations of Aetna or CVS Health to complete the merger.

 
Q: Does Aetna’s board of directors recommend that Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Yes. Aetna’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
(including the merger) are fair to and in the best interests of Aetna and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote
“FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement at the Aetna special meeting. See “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the
Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Aetna’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Aetna
Board of Directors that Aetna Shareholders Approve and Adopt the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 101 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

Q: Does Aetna’s board of directors recommend that shareholders approve the Aetna adjournment proposal?
 

A: Yes. Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Aetna adjournment proposal. See “Aetna Proposal II:
Adjournment of the Aetna Special Meeting” beginning on page 219 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What is the Aetna compensation advisory proposal and why am I being asked to vote on it?
 

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SEC, has adopted rules that require
Aetna to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote on compensation that is tied to or based on completion of the merger and that will or may be paid or
provided by Aetna to its named executive officers in connection with the merger.

 
Q: Does Aetna’s board of directors recommend that Aetna shareholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation

advisory proposal?
 

A: Yes. The Aetna board of directors unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote “FOR” the Aetna compensation advisory proposal. See
“Aetna Proposal III: Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 220 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What happens if the Aetna compensation advisory proposal is not approved?
 

A: Approval of the Aetna compensation advisory proposal is not a condition to the obligations of Aetna or CVS Health to complete the merger. The
vote is an advisory vote and is not binding. If the merger is completed, Aetna may pay the applicable compensation in connection with the merger
to its named executive officers even if Aetna shareholders fail to approve the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

 
Q: Does CVS Health’s board of directors recommend that CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance?
 

A: Yes. CVS Health’s board of directors unanimously determined that the stock issuance was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of CVS Health
and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that CVS Health stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the stock issuance. See “Aetna
Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—CVS Health’s
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the CVS Health Board of Directors that CVS Health Stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance”
beginning on page 107 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: Does CVS Health’s board of directors recommend that CVS Health stockholders approve the CVS Health adjournment proposal?
 

A: Yes. CVS Health’s board of directors unanimously recommends that CVS Health stockholders vote “FOR” the CVS Health adjournment
proposal. See “CVS Health Proposal II: Adjournment of the CVS Health Special Meeting” beginning on page 221 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What Aetna shareholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal?
 

A: The following are the vote requirements for the proposals at the Aetna special meeting:
 

 

•  Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement: The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Aetna common
shares entitled to vote on this proposal. Accordingly, an Aetna shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Aetna shareholder who
holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
this proposal.

Table of Contents

 

•  Approval of Aetna Adjournment Proposal (if necessary): A majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on this proposal (whether or
not a quorum, as defined under Pennsylvania law, is present). Accordingly, an Aetna shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an
Aetna shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting
instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote will have no effect on
the approval of this proposal.

 

 

•  Approval of the Aetna Compensation Advisory Proposal: A majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on this proposal (assuming
a quorum, as defined under Pennsylvania law, is present). Accordingly, an Aetna shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an
Aetna shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting
instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote will have no effect on
the approval of this proposal.

 
Q: What CVS Health stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the CVS Health special meeting?
 

A: The following are the vote requirements for the proposals at the CVS Health special meeting:
 

 

•  Approval of the Stock Issuance: The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the CVS Health special meeting by holders of shares
of CVS Health common stock (assuming a quorum is present). Under the current rules and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast”
on the stock issuance consist of votes “for” or “against” as well as elections to abstain from voting on the stock issuance. As a result, a CVS
Health stockholder’s election to abstain from voting on the stock issuance will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of
this proposal. The failure of a CVS Health stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a CVS Health
stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of this proposal because these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”
However, these failures to vote will make it more difficult to meet the requirement under Delaware law that the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of CVS Health common stock entitled to vote at the CVS Health special meeting be present in person or represented by
proxy to constitute a quorum at the CVS Health special meeting.

 

 

•  Approval of the CVS Health Adjournment Proposal (if necessary): The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the CVS Health
special meeting by CVS Health stockholders (whether or not a quorum, as defined under Delaware law, is present). For purposes of the CVS
Health adjournment proposal, “votes cast” means votes “for” or “against” the proposal. As a result, a CVS Health stockholder’s election to
abstain from voting, the failure of a CVS Health stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other holder of record or any other failure of a CVS Health stockholder to
vote will have no effect on the approval of this proposal.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum for the Aetna special meeting?
 

A: The holders of a majority of the outstanding Aetna common shares entitled to vote being present in person or represented by proxy constitutes a
quorum for the Aetna special meeting. Aetna common shares whose holders elect to abstain from voting will be deemed present at the Aetna
special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Aetna common shares held in “street name” with respect to which the
beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will not be deemed present at the Aetna
special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the CVS Health special meeting?
 

A: A majority of the outstanding shares of CVS Health common stock entitled to vote being present in person or represented by proxy constitutes a
quorum for the CVS Health special meeting. Elections to abstain from voting will be deemed present at the CVS Health special meeting for the
purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial
owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will not be deemed present at the CVS Health special
meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Aetna special meeting?
 

A: All holders of Aetna common shares who held shares at the record date for the Aetna special meeting (the close of business on February 5, 2018)
are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Aetna special meeting. As of the close of business on February 5, 2018, there were 326,942,525
Aetna common shares outstanding. Each holder of Aetna common shares is entitled to one vote for each Aetna common share owned at the record

Q: What if I hold shares in both Aetna and CVS Health?
 

A: If you are both an Aetna shareholder and a CVS Health stockholder, you will receive separate packages of proxy materials from each company. A
vote as an Aetna shareholder for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement (or any other proposal to be considered at the Aetna special
meeting) will not constitute a vote as a CVS Health stockholder to approve the stock issuance (or any other proposal to be considered at the CVS
Health special meeting), and vice versa. Therefore, please complete, sign and date and return all proxy cards and/or voting instructions that

with your wishes even if you later decide not to attend the Aetna special meeting.

Aetna encourages you to register your vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mail. If you attend the Aetna special meeting, you may also vote in

superseded by the vote that you cast at the Aetna special meeting. Your attendance at the Aetna special meeting alone will not revoke any proxy
previously given. To vote in person at the Aetna special meeting, beneficial owners who hold shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or

Q: If my Aetna common shares are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or other nominee holder of record automatically vote my shares

for me?
 

A: No. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must instruct the broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record on how to vote your shares.

Your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voting
instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers, banks and
other nominee holders of record who hold Aetna common shares in “street name” typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on
“routine” proposals when they have not received instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. However, brokers, banks and other
nominee holders of record typically are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are “non-routine” without specific
instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, each of the three proposals to be considered at the
Aetna special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are considered non-routine. Therefore brokers, banks and other
nominee holders of record do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the three proposals to be considered at the Aetna special meeting.

Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that are present in person or represented by proxy at the
Aetna special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record is not instructed by the beneficial owner of
such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers,
banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals to be considered at
the Aetna special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, if a beneficial owner of Aetna common shares held in “street
name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will not be present in person or
represented by proxy at the Aetna special meeting. As a result, there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three
proposals to be considered at the Aetna special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: How will my shares be represented at the Aetna special meeting?
 

A: If you correctly register your vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mail, the directors of Aetna named in your proxy card will vote your shares
in the manner you requested. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your proxy will
be voted as Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends, which is:

 

 •  “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement;
 

 •  “FOR” the Aetna adjournment proposal; and
 

 •  “FOR” the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

However, if you indicate that you wish to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, your shares will only be voted in favor
of the Aetna adjournment proposal and/or the Aetna compensation advisory proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that
proposal.

 
Q: How do I vote my shares at the CVS Health special meeting?
 

A: Via the Internet or by Telephone

If you hold shares of CVS Health common stock directly in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote via the Internet at
www.proxyvote.com or by telephone by calling (800) 690-6903 toll-free. In order to submit a proxy to vote via the Internet or by telephone, you

beneficial owner. However, brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record typically are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on
matters that are “non-routine” without specific instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, both
proposals to be considered at the CVS Health special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are considered non-routine.
Therefore brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal.

Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that are present in person or represented by proxy at the
CVS Health special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record is not instructed by the beneficial
owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because
brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to either of the proposals to be
considered at the CVS Health special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, if a beneficial owner of shares of CVS Health
common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will
not be present in person or represented by proxy at the CVS Health special meeting. As a result, there will not be any broker non-votes in
connection with either of the proposals to be considered at the CVS Health special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: How will my shares be represented at the CVS Health special meeting?
 

A: If you correctly submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by mail, the persons named in your proxy card will vote your shares in the
manner you requested. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your proxy will be
voted as CVS Health’s board of directors unanimously recommends, which is:

 

 •  “FOR” the stock issuance; and
 

 •  “FOR” the approval of the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

However, if you indicate that you wish to vote against the approval of the stock issuance, your shares will only be voted in favor of the CVS
Health adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

 
Q: Who may attend the Aetna special meeting?
 

A: Aetna shareholders at the record date for the Aetna special meeting (the close of business on February 5, 2018), or their proxy holders, may attend
the Aetna special meeting. If you hold shares in your name at the record date and plan to attend the Aetna special meeting, because of security
procedures, you will need to obtain an admission ticket in advance. In addition to obtaining an admission ticket in advance, you will be required to
provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver’s license or a passport) to be admitted to the Aetna special meeting.

If you are a beneficial owner of Aetna common shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record at the record date
(the close of business on February 5, 2018), and you plan to attend the Aetna special meeting, in addition to following the security procedures
described above, you will also need proof of beneficial ownership at the record date to obtain your admission ticket to the Aetna special meeting.
A brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of beneficial ownership. If you wish to vote your Aetna common
shares held in “street name” in person at the Aetna special meeting, you will have to obtain a written legal proxy in your name from the broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record that holds your shares.

Aetna shareholders may contact Georgeson LLC at (888) 658-3624 (toll-free) or (781) 575-2137 (for international callers) to obtain directions to
the location of the Aetna special meeting.

Edgewood NY 11717 or by fax at (631) 254-7733;

in each case, that bears a date later than the date of the proxy you want to revoke and is received prior to the applicable special meeting;
 

 
•  submitting a valid, later-dated proxy via the Internet or by telephone before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 12, 2018, or by mail that is

or postponed meeting) and voting in person, which automatically will cancel any proxy previously given, or revoking your proxy in person,
but your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy previously given.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must contact your broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record to change your vote or obtain a written legal proxy to vote your shares if you wish to cast your vote in person at the
applicable special meeting.

earlier than the date that the merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or otherwise transfer your Aetna common shares after the record date

right to receive the merger consideration to be received by Aetna shareholders in the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, you
must hold your shares immediately prior to completion of the merger.

A: The record date for the CVS Health special meeting (the close of business on February 5, 2018) is earlier than the date of the CVS Health special

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the related proxy card
or the voting instruction forms. This can occur if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, if you hold shares directly as a record

merger.

 
Q: Is completion of the merger subject to any conditions?
 

A: Yes. CVS Health and Aetna are not required to complete the merger unless a number of conditions are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, waived). These conditions include the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders, the approval of the
stock issuance by CVS Health stockholders, termination or expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the HSR Act, and the receipt of certain other regulatory
approvals. For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived) prior to
completion of the merger, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 181 of this joint proxy

of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) will recognize taxable capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the
sum of (x) the amount of cash, including cash in lieu of fractional shares, received by such U.S. holder in the merger and (y) the fair market value
of the shares of CVS Health common stock received by such U.S. holder in the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Aetna
common shares exchanged therefor. With respect to an Aetna shareholder that is a non-U.S. holder (as defined in “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and
Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences” beginning on page 167 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), the exchange of Aetna common shares for the merger
consideration pursuant to the merger generally will not result in tax to such non-U.S. holder under U.S. federal income tax laws unless such
non-U.S. holder has certain connections with the United States.

Each Aetna shareholder is urged to read the discussion in the section entitled “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement
and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 167 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and to consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or other
tax consequences to it of the merger.

Q: Should I send in my Aetna share certificates now?

issued. See “The Merger Agreement—Procedures for Surrendering Aetna Share Certificates” beginning on page 179 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. CVS Health stockholders will keep their existing share certificates, if any, and will not be required to take any action with
respect to their certificates.

Aetna restricted stock units or performance stock units, what will I receive in the merger?
 

A: Each vested stock appreciation right representing the right to receive a payment in Aetna common shares, which are referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Aetna stock appreciation rights (including

those Aetna stock appreciation rights that vest by their terms as of completion of the merger) that is outstanding as of completion of the merger
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount (without interest) equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of (x) the
sum of $145.00 plus the value equal to the product of the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices for shares of CVS Health
common stock on the NYSE on each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is two trading days prior to completion of
the merger, which average is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health closing price, multiplied by the ratio of 0.8378
of a share of CVS Health common stock for each Aetna common share (which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
exchange ratio) (the sum of such amounts is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the equity award cash consideration) over
(y) the applicable per share exercise price of the Aetna stock appreciation right multiplied by (b) the total number of Aetna common shares subject
to such Aetna stock appreciation right.

Each Aetna stock appreciation right that is not vested as of completion of the merger or that is granted after the date of the merger agreement (to
the extent permitted under the merger agreement), at completion of the merger, will be assumed by CVS Health and will become a stock
appreciation right, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as an assumed stock appreciation right, representing the right to
receive a payment in shares of CVS Health common stock on the same terms and conditions, except that the number of shares of CVS Health
common stock subject to the assumed stock appreciation right will equal the product of (a) the number of Aetna common shares that were subject
to such Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger, multiplied by (b) the sum of (x) the exchange ratio plus
(y) the quotient of $145.00, divided by the CVS Health closing price (the sum of such amounts is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the equity award exchange ratio), with such product rounded down to the nearest whole share of CVS Health Common
stock. The per share exercise price for each assumed stock appreciation right will equal the exercise price per share of such Aetna stock
appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger divided by the equity award exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

Immediately prior to completion of the merger, each outstanding Aetna restricted stock unit, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as an Aetna RSU, and each outstanding Aetna performance stock unit, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as an Aetna PSU, that provides for accelerated vesting upon completion of the merger will vest and will be converted into
the right to receive, with respect to each Aetna common share underlying the Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU, the merger consideration, less applicable
tax withholdings.

Each Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU that is not converted into a right to receive the merger consideration or is granted after the date of the merger
agreement (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement) will be assumed by CVS Health and will be converted into a time-based restricted
stock unit award covering the number of whole shares of CVS Health common stock equal to the product of the number of Aetna common shares
underlying such assumed Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU immediately prior to completion of the merger (with the performance of each Aetna PSU to
be determined based on the applicable award agreement relating to such Aetna PSU) multiplied by the equity award exchange ratio, with such
product rounded down to the nearest whole share of CVS Health common stock. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, each
assumed Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Aetna
RSU or Aetna PSU immediately prior to completion of the merger (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a
termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the merger).

The description above does not apply to equity awards held by Aetna’s non-employee directors, who will receive a cash payment for their
restricted and deferred units in accordance with the Aetna Inc. Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Aetna Director Plan.

See “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Aetna Equity Awards” beginning on page 180 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Special Meeting of Stockholders of CVS Health (see page 75)

Meeting. The CVS Health special meeting will be held on March 13, 2018, at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, located at 599
Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. At the CVS Health special meeting, CVS Health stockholders will be asked
to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve the stock issuance; and
 

 •  to approve the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

Record Date. CVS Health’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on February 5, 2018, as the record date for the determination of
the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the CVS Health special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the CVS Health special
meeting. Only CVS Health stockholders of record at the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the CVS Health special meeting
or any adjournment or postponement of the CVS Health special meeting. As of the close of business on February 5, 2018, there were 1,015,460,751
shares of CVS Health common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the CVS Health special meeting. Each holder of shares of CVS Health
common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of CVS Health common stock owned at the record date.

Quorum. The presence at the CVS Health special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
CVS Health common stock at the record date (the close of business on

February 5, 2018) will constitute a quorum. Elections to abstain from voting will be deemed present at the CVS Health special meeting for the
purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial
owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, and shares of CVS Health common stock with respect
to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be deemed present at the CVS Health special meeting for the purpose of determining
the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for the vote on the stock issuance to be taken at the CVS Health special meeting. Failure of a
quorum to be present at the CVS Health special meeting will necessitate an adjournment of the meeting and will subject CVS Health to additional
expense.

Required Vote. Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the stock issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at
the CVS Health special meeting by holders of shares of CVS Health common stock. CVS Health cannot complete the merger unless its
stockholders approve the stock issuance. Under the current rules and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast” on the stock issuance
consist of votes “for” or “against”, as well as elections to abstain from voting on the stock issuance. As a result, a CVS Health stockholder’s
election to abstain from voting on the stock issuance will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present,
the failure of a CVS Health stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to
give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a CVS Health stockholder to vote will have
no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the stock issuance because these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”

Approval of the CVS Health adjournment proposal, whether or not a quorum, as defined under Delaware law, is present, requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the CVS Health special meeting by CVS Health stockholders. For purposes of the CVS Health
adjournment proposal, “votes cast” means votes “for” or “against” the proposal. As a result, a CVS Health stockholder’s election to abstain from
voting on the CVS Health adjournment proposal, the failure of a CVS Health stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other
failure of a CVS Health stockholder to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

Stock Ownership of and Voting by CVS Health Directors and Executive Officers. At the record date for the CVS Health special meeting
(the close of business on February 5, 2018), CVS Health’s directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right
to vote in the aggregate 1,279,586 shares of CVS Health common stock at the CVS Health special meeting, which represents approximately 0.13%
of the shares of CVS Health common stock entitled to vote at the CVS Health special meeting. Approval of the stock issuance requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the CVS Health special meeting by holders of shares of CVS Health common stock (assuming a
quorum is present).

Each of CVS Health’s directors and executive officers is expected, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, to vote his or her
shares of CVS Health common stock “FOR” the stock issuance and “FOR” the CVS Health adjournment proposal, although none of CVS
Health’s directors and executive officers has entered into any agreement requiring them to do so.

Special Meeting of Shareholders of Aetna (see page 82)

Meeting. The Aetna special meeting will be held on March 13, 2018, at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, located at 450 Lexington
Avenue, New York, NY 10017, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. At the Aetna special meeting, Aetna shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on
the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve and adopt the merger agreement;
 

 •  to approve the Aetna adjournment proposal; and
 

 •  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Table of Contents

Record Date. A committee of Aetna’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on February 5, 2018, as the record date for the
determination of the Aetna shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the
Aetna special meeting. Only Aetna shareholders of record at the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Aetna special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Aetna special meeting. As of the close of business on February 5, 2018, there were
326,942,525 Aetna common shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the Aetna special meeting. Each holder of Aetna common shares is entitled
to one vote for each Aetna common share owned at the record date.

Quorum. The presence at the Aetna special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Aetna common
shares at the record date (the close of business on February 5, 2018) will constitute a quorum. Aetna common shares whose holders elect to abstain
from voting will be deemed present at the Aetna special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Aetna common shares
held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record, and Aetna common shares with respect to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be deemed present at the Aetna
special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for the vote on the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the vote on the Aetna compensation advisory proposal to be taken at the Aetna special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be
present at the Aetna special meeting will necessitate an adjournment of the meeting and will subject Aetna to additional expense.

Required Vote. Pursuant to Aetna’s amended and restated articles of incorporation, which are referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Aetna’s articles, to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of Aetna
common shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required. Aetna cannot complete the merger and the merger consideration will not
be paid unless its shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. Because approval and adoption of the merger agreement
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of Aetna common shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, an
Aetna shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Aetna shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any
other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement.

To approve (i) the Aetna adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum, as defined under Pennsylvania law, is present) and (ii) on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal (assuming a quorum, as defined under Pennsylvania law, is present), the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Aetna special meeting by holders of Aetna common shares is required. For purposes of each
of the Aetna adjournment proposal and the Aetna compensation advisory proposal, “votes cast” means votes “for” or “against” the applicable
proposal. As a result, an Aetna shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Aetna shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street
name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record
or any other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Aetna adjournment proposal or any vote
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Share Ownership of and Voting by Aetna Directors and Executive Officers. At the record date for the Aetna special meeting (the close of
business on February 5, 2018), Aetna’s directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the
aggregate 1,357,761 Aetna common shares at the Aetna special meeting, which represents approximately 0.42% of the Aetna common shares
entitled to vote at the Aetna special meeting. To approve and adopt the merger agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of Aetna
common shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required.

Table of Contents

Each of Aetna’s directors and executive officers is expected, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, to vote his or her Aetna
common shares “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the Aetna adjournment proposal and “FOR” the Aetna
compensation advisory proposal, although none of Aetna’s directors or executive officers has entered into any agreement requiring them to do so.

What Aetna Shareholders Will Receive in the Merger (see page 178)

If the merger is completed, Aetna shareholders will be entitled to receive, in exchange for each Aetna common share that they own
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, $145.00 in cash without interest thereon and 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock,
together with cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares as described below.

CVS Health will not issue any fractional shares in the merger. Instead, the total number of shares of CVS Health common stock that each
Aetna shareholder will be entitled to receive in the merger will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each Aetna shareholder will be
entitled to receive cash, without interest thereon, for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that he or she otherwise would be entitled
to receive in the merger. The amount of cash for fractional shares will be calculated by multiplying the fraction of a share of CVS Health common
stock that the Aetna shareholder otherwise would be entitled to receive in the merger by the CVS Health closing price.

Example: If you own 100 Aetna common shares at the time the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $14,500.00 in cash without
interest thereon and 83 shares of CVS Health common stock. In addition, you will be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to 0.78 of a share
of CVS Health common stock multiplied by the CVS Health closing price.

The exchange ratio is fixed, which means that it will not change between now and the date of the merger, regardless of whether the market
price of either shares of CVS Health common stock or Aetna common shares changes. Therefore, the value of the share consideration will depend
on the market price of shares of CVS Health common stock at the time Aetna shareholders receive shares of CVS Health common stock in the
merger. Based on the closing price of a share of CVS Health common stock on the NYSE on October 25, 2017, the last trading day prior to news
reports of a potential transaction between CVS Health and Aetna, the merger consideration represented approximately $208.28 in value for each
Aetna common share. Based on the closing price of a share of CVS Health common stock on the NYSE on February 8, 2018, the most recent
trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for which this information was available, the merger consideration represented
approximately $204.11 in value for each Aetna common share. The market price of shares of CVS Health common stock has fluctuated since
the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to the date of the Aetna special meeting and the date the merger is completed and thereafter. The market price of
shares of CVS Health common stock when received by Aetna shareholders after the merger is completed could be greater than, less than
or the same as the market price of shares of CVS Health common stock on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the time
of the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Treatment of Aetna Equity Awards (see page 180)

At completion of the merger, each outstanding vested Aetna stock appreciation right (including those Aetna stock appreciation rights that vest
by their terms at completion of the merger), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the excess, if any, of the equity award cash consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such Aetna stock appreciation right
multiplied by the total number of Aetna common shares subject to such Aetna stock appreciation right.

Table of Contents

Each Aetna stock appreciation right that is not vested as of completion of the merger or that is granted after the date of the merger agreement
(to the extent permitted under the merger agreement), at completion of the merger, will be assumed by CVS Health and will become an assumed
stock appreciation right representing the right to receive a payment in shares of CVS Health common stock on the same terms and conditions,
except that the number of shares of CVS Health common stock subject to the assumed stock appreciation right will equal the product of the number
of Aetna common shares that were subject to such Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger multiplied by the
equity award exchange ratio, with such product rounded down to the nearest whole share of CVS Health common stock. The per share exercise
price for each assumed stock appreciation right will equal the exercise price per share of such Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to
completion of the merger divided by the equity award exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Immediately prior to completion of the merger, each outstanding Aetna RSU and each outstanding Aetna PSU that provides for accelerated
vesting upon completion of the merger will vest and will be converted into the right to receive, with respect to each Aetna common share
underlying the Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU, the merger consideration, less applicable tax withholdings.

Each Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU that is not converted into a right to receive the merger consideration or is granted after the date of the merger
agreement (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement) will be assumed by CVS Health and will be converted into a time-based restricted
stock unit award covering the number of whole shares of CVS Health common stock equal to the product of the number of Aetna common shares
underlying such assumed Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU immediately prior to completion of the merger (with the performance of each Aetna PSU to be
determined based on the applicable award agreement relating to such Aetna PSU) multiplied by the equity award exchange ratio, with such product
rounded down to the nearest whole share of CVS Health common stock. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, each assumed
Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Aetna RSU or
Aetna PSU immediately prior to completion of the merger (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of
the holder’s employment in connection with or following the merger).

The description above does not apply to equity awards held by Aetna’s non-employee directors, who will receive a cash payment for their
restricted and deferred units in accordance with the Aetna Director Plan.

Ownership of CVS Health Common Stock After the Merger (see page 89)

Based on the number of Aetna common shares (including the number of shares underlying Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs,
Aetna PSUs and unexercised rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan) outstanding as of February 5, 2018, and the treatment of Aetna
common shares, stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs, Aetna PSUs and unexercised rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan in the
merger, CVS Health expects to issue approximately 280 million shares of CVS Health common stock to Aetna shareholders and Aetna equity
award holders upon completion of the merger and reserve for issuance additional shares of CVS Health common stock in connection with the
assumption, exercise and settlement of Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs that are not vested as of completion of the
merger or that are granted after the date of the merger agreement (to the extent permitted by the merger agreement). The actual number of shares of
CVS Health common stock to be issued and reserved for issuance upon completion of the merger will be determined at completion of the merger
based on the exchange ratio and the number of Aetna common shares (including the number of shares underlying Aetna stock appreciation rights,
Aetna RSUs, Aetna PSUs and unexercised rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan) outstanding at that time. Based on the number of
Aetna common shares (including the number of shares underlying Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs, Aetna PSUs and unexercised
rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan) outstanding as of February 5, 2018, and the number of shares of CVS Health common stock
outstanding as of February 5, 2018, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Aetna shareholders will own
approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of CVS Health common stock.

Governance and Social Matters Following Completion of the Merger (see page 180)

At completion of the merger, the size of the board of directors of CVS Health will be increased by three and the vacancies created thereby
will be filled by Mark T. Bertolini, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aetna, and two other individuals who are serving on the board of
directors of Aetna immediately prior to completion of the merger who meet CVS Health’s independence criteria as in effect as of such time and
who will

Table of Contents

be jointly designated by Aetna and CVS Health prior to completion of the merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Governance and Social Matters
Following Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 180 for further information.

The merger agreement provides that, for at least three years following completion of the merger, CVS Health will preserve Aetna Foundation,
Inc. in a manner consistent in all material respects with the past practice of Aetna, including by maintaining its name and its charitable mission.

The merger agreement also provides that, for at least five years following completion of the merger, CVS Health will maintain “Aetna” as the
primary brand for the insurance businesses of CVS Health and its subsidiaries (including Aetna and its subsidiaries).

Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 209)

In considering the recommendation of the Aetna board of directors to approve and adopt the merger agreement, Aetna shareholders should be
aware that Aetna’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Aetna
shareholders generally. Aetna’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and
negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (including the merger), and in recommending to Aetna shareholders that the merger agreement be approved and adopted.

These interests include the following:
 

 

•  Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and the outstanding equity awards, outstanding equity awards held by Aetna’s non-
employee directors will vest upon completion of the merger. Outstanding unvested equity awards currently held by Aetna’s executive
officers will either vest upon the completion of the merger or upon an involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) in
connection with completion of the merger. Assuming a closing date for the merger of December 3, 2018 and price per Aetna common
share of $205.03, which is calculated based on the price of a share of CVS Health common stock of $71.65, which is the average
closing price of a share of CVS Health common stock over the five-business-day period following the first public announcement of the
merger agreement, the aggregate value of vesting of outstanding unvested equity awards upon completion of the merger or upon an
involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) in connection with completion of the merger payable in the aggregate to
Aetna’s non-employee directors and executive officers is estimated to be approximately $48.7 million for Aetna stock appreciation
rights, approximately $1.7 million for Aetna RSUs and approximately $30.2 million for Aetna PSUs.

 

 

•  Pursuant to individual employment arrangements and the terms of Aetna’s severance plan, each of Aetna’s executive officers is eligible
to receive severance benefits either upon an involuntary termination of employment without “cause” or a resignation for “good reason”
in connection with completion of the merger. Pursuant to individual employment arrangements and Aetna’s severance plan, upon a
qualifying termination, Mr. Bertolini and Ms. Lynch are eligible to receive 24 months of cash compensation (calculated as annual base
salary and target annual cash bonus opportunity) payable in equal installments over a period of two years and a pro rata portion of their
target bonus opportunity for the year of termination, and Aetna’s other executive officers are eligible to receive between 38 and 100
weeks of salary continuation. In addition, upon a qualifying termination, all of Aetna’s executive officers will continue to receive
Aetna-provided benefits for nine weeks, and may elect to continue coverage under Aetna’s medical plan at employee rates for an
additional two months thereafter. Any annual bonus will be paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, except that any
executive officer terminated without “cause” in connection with completion of the merger will receive

Table of Contents

 
a bonus payment for the full calendar year. Assuming a qualifying termination of employment for all of Aetna’s executive officers upon
completion of the merger, the aggregate value of severance benefits to be paid or provided (including benefits continuation) to Aetna’s
executive officers is estimated to be approximately $24.6 million.

 

 •  Aetna’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement.

These interests are described in further detail, including more information on the assumptions used in calculating the estimated amounts set
forth above, under “Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and
Insurance” beginning on pages 209 and 201, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Listing of CVS Health Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of Aetna Common Shares (see page 170)

CVS Health will apply to have the shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued in the merger approved for listing on the NYSE, where
shares of CVS Health common stock are currently traded. If the merger is completed, Aetna common shares will no longer be listed on the NYSE
and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Exchange Act.

Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights Not Available to Aetna Shareholders (see page 167)

Under Pennsylvania law, Aetna shareholders will not be entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger.

Completion of the Merger Is Subject to Certain Conditions (see page 181)

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, the obligation of each of CVS Health and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Aetna, on the other hand, to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, waiver) of a number of conditions, including the following:
 

 
•  approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Aetna

common shares;
 

 •  approval of the stock issuance by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the CVS Health special meeting;
 

 
•  absence of any applicable law (including any order) enacted, adopted or promulgated after of the date of the merger agreement being in

effect in the U.S. that enjoins, prevents or prohibits completion of the merger;
 

 
•  effectiveness of, and absence of any stop order with respect to, the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy

statement/prospectus forms a part, relating to the stock issuance;
 

 
•  approval for the listing on the NYSE of the shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued in the merger, subject to official notice of

issuance;
 

 
•  accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality

thresholds;
 

 
•  performance (or cure of any non-performance) in all material respects by the other party of the covenants and agreements required to be

performed by it prior to completion of the merger; and

Table of Contents

 
•  the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party (see “The Merger Agreement—Definition of ‘Material Adverse Effect’”

beginning on page 184 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the definition of material adverse effect).

In addition to the conditions to all parties’ obligations, the obligations of CVS Health and Merger Sub to complete the merger are subject to
the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of certain additional conditions, including the following:
 

 

•  expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act without the imposition of any term or
condition that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory material adverse
effect on CVS Health or Aetna (see “The Merger Agreement—Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant” beginning on page 194 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus for the definition of regulatory material adverse effect); and

 

 

•  certain actions by or in respect of, and filings with, certain governmental authorities, which are referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the required governmental authorizations, having been made or obtained without the imposition of any term or
condition that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory material adverse
effect on CVS Health or Aetna.

In addition to the conditions to all parties’ obligations, the obligation of Aetna to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of certain additional conditions, including (i) expiration or early termination of the waiting period
relating to the merger under the HSR Act and (ii) the required governmental authorizations having been made or obtained.

CVS Health and Aetna cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be
completed.

The Merger May Not Be Completed Without All Required Regulatory Approvals (see page 165)

Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR
Act and the required governmental authorizations having been made or obtained and being in full force and effect, and in the case of CVS Health,
without the imposition of any term or condition that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or Aetna.

Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period requirements have
expired or been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the Federal Trade Commission, which is
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the FTC, and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, which is referred to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a
30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting
period. The merger is being reviewed by the DOJ. If the DOJ issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material prior to the
expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both
parties have substantially complied with the request for additional information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier.

Each of CVS Health and Aetna filed its respective HSR Act notification and report with respect to the merger on January 2, 2018. On
February 1, 2018, CVS Health and Aetna each received a request for additional information, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the second request, from the DOJ in connection with the DOJ’s review of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both CVS Health and Aetna

Table of Contents

have substantially complied with the second request or such later time as the parties may agree with the DOJ, unless the waiting period is
terminated earlier by the DOJ. CVS Health and Aetna have been cooperating with the DOJ staff since shortly after the announcement of the merger
agreement and are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ staff in its review of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Pursuant to federal health care laws and regulations and, in some instances, the health care and insurance laws and regulations of certain
states, and pursuant to certain licenses and contracts of certain of Aetna’s subsidiaries, applicable federal and state regulatory and governmental
authorities must approve, or be notified of, CVS Health’s acquisition of control of Aetna’s health maintenance organizations, insurance companies,
pharmacy businesses and other regulated businesses or entities. To obtain these approvals and provide such notices, CVS Health, or the applicable
CVS Health subsidiary, and in some instances Aetna, or the applicable Aetna regulated entity, as the case may be, has filed and/or will file
acquisition of control and/or material modification or other statements, notices or applications, as required by federal health care law or regulation
and the insurance and health care laws and regulations of each applicable state and country or the Aetna regulated entities’ licenses and contracts.
In addition, certain non-U.S. governmental authorities must approve, or be notified of, the merger, and CVS Health and/or Aetna and/or their
respective subsidiaries will file all such statements, notices, or applications, as are required by the laws of applicable non-U.S. governmental
authorities.

Neither CVS Health nor Aetna is aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required for completion of the merger
other than those described above. It is presently contemplated that if any such additional material governmental approvals or actions are required,
those approvals or actions will be sought.

CVS Health and Aetna have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the
merger, which reasonable best efforts include contesting any proceeding brought by a governmental authority seeking to prohibit completion of the
merger or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection with the merger. In using its reasonable best efforts, under the terms
of the merger agreement, CVS Health is required to take all actions and do all things necessary, proper or advisable to complete the merger in
connection with (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act, (ii) any other antitrust law or
(iii) the required governmental authorizations, except that CVS Health is not required to take any action or agree to any term or condition in
connection with those matters if that action, term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or on Aetna (see “The Merger Agreement—Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant”
beginning on page 194 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the definition of regulatory material adverse effect). In addition, in connection
with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger, (x) neither CVS Health nor Aetna is required to take any action or agree to
any term or condition that is not conditioned upon completion of the merger and (y) Aetna is not permitted to take any action or agree to any term
or condition without CVS Health’s consent.

Description of Debt Financing (see page 170)

The merger is not subject to a financing condition. On December 3, 2017, CVS Health entered into a bridge facility commitment letter, which
is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the bridge facility commitment letter, with Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Bank
USA, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (solely in its
capacity as an arranger), to finance up to $49.0 billion of the cash consideration and fees, commissions and expenses payable by CVS Health in
connection with the merger to the extent that CVS Health has not received $49.0 billion of net cash proceeds from a combination of (a) the issuance
by CVS Health or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries of a combination of equity securities, equity-linked securities or unsecured debt securities
and/or (b) unsecured term loans, in each case, at or prior to completion of the merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as the bridge facility. Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and Bank of America, N.A. each
provided a commitment to fund loans under the bridge facility

Commercial Bank of China Limited, New York Branch, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, New York Branch and Guggenheim Life and Annuity
Company which are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the additional bridge commitment parties. The bridge
joinder agreement amends the bridge facility commitment letter and reallocates the commitments of the initial bridge commitment parties to fund
loans under the bridge facility among the initial bridge commitment parties and the additional bridge commitment parties. The initial bridge
commitment parties together with the additional bridge commitment parties are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
the bridge commitment parties. The bridge commitment parties’ obligation to fund the bridge facility is subject to several limited conditions as set
forth in the bridge facility commitment letter, including, among others, completion of the merger, the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect
(as defined in the bridge facility commitment letter) on Aetna, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related
to both CVS Health and Aetna, the absence of certain defaults by CVS Health, the delivery of certain financial statements of CVS Health and
Aetna and other customary conditions to completion.

On December 15, 2017, CVS Health entered into a term loan agreement, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
term loan agreement, with a group of twenty banks and other financial institutions, which are collectively referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the term lenders, consisting of a $3.0 billion three-year tranche and a $2.0 billion five-year tranche, to finance $5.0 billion
of the cash consideration and fees, commissions and expenses payable by CVS Health in connection with the merger, which is referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the term loan facility. The occurrence of the effective date under the term loan agreement on December 15,
2017 had the effect of reducing the bridge facility by a principal amount of $5.0 billion to $44.0 billion. The term lenders’ obligation to fund the
term loan facility is subject to several limited conditions as set forth in the term loan agreement, including, among others, completion of the merger,
the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the term loan agreement) on Aetna, the accuracy in all material respects of certain
representations and warranties related to both CVS Health and Aetna, the absence of certain defaults by CVS Health, the delivery of certain
financial statements of CVS Health and Aetna and other customary conditions to completion.

On December 15, 2017, CVS Health and its current group of lenders entered into a first amendment to each of CVS Health’s existing
revolving credit facilities (consisting of (i) a $1.0 billion, 364-day unsecured credit facility expiring on May 17, 2018, (ii) a $1.25 billion, five-year
unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on July 24, 2019, (iii) a $1.25 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on July 1, 2020
and (iv) a $1.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on May 18, 2022, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the 2017 five-year revolving credit facility, to (w) amend the covenant restricting the incurrence of debt by CVS Health’s
subsidiaries to up to 15% of net tangible assets, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the net tangible assets test, by
(a) excluding any indebtedness of Aetna and its subsidiaries existing as of completion of the merger (other than any increase, refinancing or
replacement thereof), which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Aetna existing indebtedness, from indebtedness for
purposes of determining compliance with the net tangible assets test, and (b) restricting the indebtedness that may be incurred by all of CVS
Health’s subsidiaries (excluding the Aetna existing indebtedness and other indebtedness under capital leases incurred in connection with a sale and
leaseback transaction) to an amount not exceeding $900.0 million in the aggregate, in each case, on and following completion of the merger until
the date that CVS Health is in compliance with the net tangible assets

covenant, (y) amend the financial covenant by (a) increasing the consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio from 0.60:1.00 to 0.65:1.00
from completion of the merger through and including the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, and (b) excluding unsecured indebtedness in an
aggregate principal amount not exceeding $49.0 billion incurred by CVS Health for the purpose of financing the merger (including all of the
transaction costs, fees, commissions and expenses in connection therewith) and which is redeemable or prepayable if the merger is not
consummated, from the calculation of consolidated indebtedness and total capitalization, until the earliest of the occurrence of completion of the
merger, the date that is 30 days following the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and August 31, 2019, and
(z) increase the threshold amount of specified events of default to (a) prior to the later of (i) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility
commitment letter in accordance with its terms and (ii) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility if it is entered into, $250.0 million,
and (b) at all other times, $200.0 million. In this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS Health’s existing revolving credit agreements are referred
to as the revolving credit agreements, and the lenders under the revolving credit agreements are referred to as the revolving lenders.

For a more complete description of CVS Health’s debt financing for the merger, see “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger
Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Description of Debt Financing” beginning on page 170 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

CVS Health and Aetna Expect the Merger to be Completed in the Second Half of 2018 (see page 177)

The merger will occur three business days after the conditions to its completion have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, waived, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS Health and Aetna expect
the merger to be completed in the second half of 2018. However, there can be no assurance as to when, or if, the merger will occur.

No Solicitation by Aetna or CVS Health (see page 190)

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the exceptions described below
and in the merger agreement, each of Aetna and CVS Health has agreed not to, among other things, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal from any third party, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any third party that such party knows is seeking to make, or has made, an acquisition proposal, (iii) fail to make or
withdraw or qualify, amend or modify in any manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of such party’s board of directors that its
shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement, in the case of Aetna, or its stockholders approve the stock issuance, in the case of CVS
Health, or (iv) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement.

However, at any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders, in the case of Aetna, or the approval
of the stock issuance by CVS Health stockholders, in the case of CVS Health, subject to the terms and conditions described in the merger
agreement, each of Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, is permitted to:
 

 
•  engage in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made after the date of the merger agreement a superior proposal or an

acquisition proposal that is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal;
 

 

•  following receipt of a superior proposal after the date of the merger agreement, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other
party the recommendation of such party’s board of directors that its shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement, in the case
of Aetna, or its stockholders approve the stock issuance, in the case of CVS Health, and/or terminate the merger agreement to enter into

definitive agreement providing for such superior proposal and pay concurrently a termination fee to the other party (See “The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 203 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus); and

 

 
•  in response to certain events other than receipt of a superior proposal, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the

recommendation of such party’s board of directors that its shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement, in the case of Aetna,
or its stockholders approve the stock issuance, in the case of CVS Health.

Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, is only permitted to take the actions described above if its board of directors determines that the failure
to take that action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. In addition, Aetna’s board of
directors is not permitted to withdraw or modify its recommendation that Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement or to
terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, and CVS Health’s board of
directors is not permitted to withdraw or modify its recommendation that CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance or to terminate the
merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, unless, before taking that action, the applicable
party notifies the other party that it intends to take that action and, if requested by the other party, negotiates in good faith with the other party for
certain periods of time regarding any proposal by the other party to amend the terms of the merger agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 203)

referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the end date, in which case the merger agreement may be terminated by
either CVS Health or Aetna if the merger has not been completed on or before June 3, 2019;

 

 
•  there is in effect any applicable law or final and non-appealable order of any governmental authority in the U.S., in each case,

enacted, adopted or promulgated after the date of the merger agreement, that enjoins, prevents or prohibits completion of the
merger;

In addition, as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, CVS Health has agreed to pay Aetna a termination fee of $2.1 billion if both (x) the merger agreement is
terminated under any the following circumstances:

order being in effect in the U.S. that prohibits completion of the merger (but only if that condition is not satisfied solely due to any applicable law
or final and non-appealable order in respect of certain regulatory matters).

Except in the case of fraud, if either party receives a termination fee in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement, the receipt of
the termination fee will be the receiving party’s sole and exclusive remedy against the paying party.

See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee and Expenses” beginning on page 205 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more
complete description of the circumstances under which Aetna or CVS Health will be required to pay a termination fee.

Specific Performance; Remedies (see page 207)

Under the merger agreement, each of CVS Health and Aetna is entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger
agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of the merger agreement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 167)

The exchange of Aetna common shares for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, an Aetna shareholder that is a U.S. holder (as defined in “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the
Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) will recognize
taxable capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of (x) the amount of cash, including cash in lieu of
fractional shares, received by such U.S. holder in the merger and (y) the fair market value of the shares of CVS Health common stock received by
such U.S. holder in the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Aetna common shares exchanged therefor. With respect to an
Aetna shareholder that is a non-U.S. holder (as defined in “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health
Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”), the exchange of Aetna common shares for the
merger consideration pursuant to the merger generally will not result in tax to such non-U.S. holder under U.S. federal income tax laws unless such
non-U.S. holder has certain connections with the United States.

Table of Contents

Each Aetna shareholder is urged to read the discussion in the section entitled “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger
Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 167
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and to consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or
other tax consequences to it of the merger.

Accounting Treatment (see page 169)

The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of a business. CVS Health will record assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Aetna
primarily at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described under Note 4.
Estimate of Consideration Expected to be Transferred under “CVS Health and Aetna Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements” beginning on page 42 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as
goodwill.

Rights of Aetna Shareholders Will Change as a Result of the Merger (see page 225)

Aetna shareholders will have different rights once they become CVS Health stockholders due to differences between the organizational
documents of CVS Health and Aetna and differences between Delaware law, under which CVS Health is incorporated, and Pennsylvania law,
under which Aetna is incorporated. These differences are described in more detail under “Comparison of Stockholder Rights” beginning on page
225 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (see page 176)

As of February 8, 2018, seven complaints had been filed by purported Aetna shareholders challenging the merger. The first, a putative class
action complaint, was filed by Olivier Miramond in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned Miramond v.
Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00083. The second complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by
Shiva Stein individually, is captioned Stein v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00136. The third complaint, a putative class action, was filed
by Robert Freedman in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and is captioned Freedman v. Aetna, Inc., et al.,
case number 2:18-cv-00323. The fourth complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by Luan Pham
individually, is captioned Pham v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00154. The fifth complaint, filed in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust individually, is captioned Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. Aetna Inc. et al.,
case number 2:18-cv-00361. The sixth complaint, a putative class action complaint, was filed by Dr. Eli Inzlicht-Sprei in the United States District
Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned Inzlicht-Sprei v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00176. The seventh complaint, a
putative class action complaint, was filed by Joel Rosenfeld in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned
Rosenfeld v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00213. The complaints name as defendants Aetna and each member of Aetna’s board of
directors. In addition, the Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust complaint names CVS Health and Merger Sub as defendants. The complaints generally
allege, among other things, that the merger consideration in the proposed transaction is unfair, inadequate and undervalues Aetna; that the
defendants failed to conduct a fair and reasonable sales process; that the merger agreement’s deal protection provisions improperly deter other
suitors from submitting a superior offer for Aetna; that Aetna’s board of directors and executive officers are conflicted because they have secured
unique benefits for themselves from the proposed transaction not available to Aetna shareholders generally; and that the defendants authorized the
filing of a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement. Among other remedies, the complaints seek to enjoin the Aetna special
meeting and the closing of the merger, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. Defendants believe that the complaints are without merit.

Risk Factors (see page 62)

(2) As of January 1, 2016, CVS Health early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) issued by the Financial

Accounting Standards Board in November 2015. The effect of the retrospective adoption on CVS Health’s historical consolidated balance sheets is
a reduction in current assets and deferred income taxes of $985 million, $902 million and $693 million as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
respectively.

(3) “Fixed charges” consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of debt discount, and a portion of net rental expense deemed to be
representative of the interest factor. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated as income from continuing operations, before provision for
income taxes, plus fixed charges (excluding capitalized interest), plus amortization of capitalized interest, with the sum divided by fixed charges.

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED PER SHARE DATA

The following table sets forth selected historical and unaudited pro forma combined per share information for CVS Health and Aetna.

Historical Per Common Share Information of CVS Health and Aetna. The historical per common share information of each of CVS Health and
Aetna below is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of each of CVS Health and Aetna as of and for the year ended December 31,
2016, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of each of CVS Health and Aetna as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined per CVS Health Common Share Data. The unaudited pro forma combined per CVS Health common share data
set forth below give effect to the merger under the acquisition method of accounting, as if the merger had been effective on January 1, 2016, the first day
of CVS Health’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, in the case of income from continuing operations per share. The unaudited pro forma combined
book value per CVS Health common share data set forth below give effect to the merger under the acquisition method of accounting, as if the merger
had been effective September 30, 2017, assuming that each outstanding Aetna common share, the vested Aetna RSUs and vested Aetna PSUs had been
converted into shares of CVS Health common stock based on the exchange ratio.

The unaudited pro forma combined per CVS Health common share data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of each of
CVS Health and Aetna as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of each of CVS
Health and Aetna as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

The acquisition method of accounting is based on Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards Codification (which is referred to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as ASC) 805, Business Combinations, and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurements, which CVS Health has adopted as required. Acquisition accounting requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities
assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value measurements recorded in acquisition accounting are dependent upon
certain valuation studies of Aetna’s assets and liabilities and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient
information for a definitive measurement. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments reflect the assets and liabilities of Aetna at their preliminary estimated
fair values. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final values in acquisition accounting will occur, and these differences could have a
material impact on the unaudited pro forma combined per share information set forth in the following table.

The unaudited pro forma combined per CVS Health common share data does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that CVS
Health would have achieved had the companies been combined during these periods or to project the future results of operations that CVS Health may
achieve after completion of the merger.

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined per Aetna Equivalent Share Data. The unaudited pro forma combined per Aetna equivalent share data set forth
below shows the effect of the merger from the perspective of an owner of Aetna common shares. The information was calculated by multiplying the
unaudited pro forma combined per share of CVS Health common stock amounts by the exchange ratio.

Generally. You should read the below information in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the historical consolidated financial statements of CVS Health and Aetna and related notes that have been filed
with the SEC, certain of which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial
Data of CVS Health”, “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data of Aetna” and “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on pages 37,

CVS HEALTH AND AETNA UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016, and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, combine the historical consolidated statements of income of CVS Health and Aetna, giving effect to the merger as if it had
occurred on January 1, 2016, the first day of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as
of September 30, 2017, combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health and Aetna, giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred
on September 30, 2017. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the
statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined company’s results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. In addition,
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the following historical
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus:
 

 
•  separate audited historical consolidated financial statements of CVS Health as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2016, and the

related notes included in CVS Health’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016;
 

 
•  separate audited historical consolidated financial statements of Aetna as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2016, and the related notes

included in Aetna’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016;
 

 
•  separate unaudited historical consolidated financial statements of CVS Health as of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2017,

and the related notes included in CVS Health’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2017; and
 

 
•  separate unaudited historical consolidated financial statements of Aetna as of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2017, and the

related notes included in Aetna’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2017.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared by CVS Health using the acquisition method of accounting
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as GAAP. CVS Health
has been treated as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes. The acquisition accounting is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies
that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. The merger has not yet received the
necessary approvals from governmental authorities. Under the HSR Act and other relevant laws and regulations, before completion of the merger, there
are significant limitations regarding what CVS Health can learn about Aetna. The assets and liabilities of Aetna have been measured based on various
preliminary estimates using assumptions that CVS Health believes are reasonable based on information that is currently available to it. Differences
between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur, and those differences could have a material impact on the
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the combined company’s future results of operations and financial
position. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.

CVS Health intends to commence the necessary valuation and other studies required to complete the acquisition accounting promptly upon
completion of the merger and will finalize the acquisition accounting as soon as practicable within the required measurement period, but in no event
later than one year following completion of the merger.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. Description of Transaction

On December 3, 2017, CVS Health, Merger Sub and Aetna entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Aetna will become a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Health. Upon completion of the merger, each Aetna
common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $145.00 in cash,
without interest, and 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock.

As of completion of the merger, each vested Aetna stock appreciation right (including those Aetna stock appreciation rights that vest by their
terms as of completion of the merger) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount (without interest) equal to the product of
(a) the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of $145.00 plus the value equal to the product of the CVS Health closing price multiplied by the exchange ratio over
(ii) the applicable per share exercise price of such Aetna stock appreciation right multiplied by (b) the total number of Aetna common shares subject to
such Aetna stock appreciation right. Each outstanding vested Aetna stock appreciation right (including those Aetna stock appreciation rights that vest by
their terms as of completion of the merger) with a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the equity award cash consideration will be cancelled
for no consideration.

As of completion of the merger, each Aetna stock appreciation right that is not vested as of completion of the merger or that is granted after the
date of the merger agreement (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement), will be assumed by CVS Health and will become a stock
appreciation right representing the right to receive a payment in shares of CVS Health common stock on the same terms and conditions, except that
(i) the number of shares of CVS Health common stock subject to the assumed stock appreciation right will equal the product of (A) the number of Aetna
common shares that were subject to such Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger multiplied by (B) the equity
award exchange ratio (with such product rounded down to the nearest whole share of CVS Health common stock) and (ii) the per share exercise price
will equal the exercise price per share of the Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger divided by the equity award
exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

Immediately prior to completion of the merger, each outstanding Aetna RSU and Aetna PSU that provides for accelerated vesting upon
completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will vest and will be converted into the right to receive, with respect to each Aetna
common share underlying the Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU, the merger consideration.

As of completion of the merger, each Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU that is not converted into a right to receive the merger consideration, or that is
granted after the date of the merger agreement (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement), will be assumed by CVS Health and will be
converted into a time-vesting CVS Health RSU award corresponding to the merger consideration.

Completion of the merger is subject to the approval of and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders, the approval of the stock
issuance by CVS Health stockholders, termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the required governmental authorizations
having been obtained and being in full force and effect and certain other conditions to completion of the merger. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by law, waiver of the conditions described in the preceding sentence,
CVS Health and Aetna expect the merger to be completed in the second half of 2018.

 
2. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and are based on the
historical consolidated financial statements of CVS Health and Aetna.
 

47



9/26/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1122304/000119312518038189/d511475ddefm14a.htm 64/274

Table of Contents

The acquisition method of accounting is based on ASC 805, Business Combinations, and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurement.

ASC 805 requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition
date. In addition, ASC 805 requires that the consideration transferred be measured at the date the merger is completed at the then-current market price.
This requirement will likely result in a per share equity component that is different from the amount assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements, since the market price of the shares of CVS Health common stock at the date the merger is completed is likely to be
different than the $78.79 market price that was used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The market
price of $78.79 was based upon the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on the NYSE on February 1, 2018.

ASC 820 defines the term “fair value,” sets forth the valuation requirements for any asset or liability measured at fair value, expands related
disclosure requirements and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair
value is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.” This is an exit price concept for the valuation of the asset or liability. In addition, market participants are assumed
to be buyers and sellers in the principal (or the most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the
highest and best use by these market participants. As a result of these standards, CVS Health may be required to record the fair value of assets which are
not intended to be used or sold and/or to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect CVS Health’s intended use of those assets. Many of these
fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and
circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded, as of completion of the merger, primarily
at their respective fair values and added to those of CVS Health. Financial statements and reported results of operations of CVS Health issued after
completion of the merger will reflect these values, but will not be retroactively restated to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations
of Aetna.

Under ASC 805, acquisition-related transaction costs (e.g., advisory, legal and other professional fees) are not included as a component of
consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which such costs are incurred. Acquisition-related transaction costs
expected to be incurred by CVS Health include estimated fees related to a bridge financing commitment and agreement. Total acquisition-related
transaction costs expected to be incurred by CVS Health and Aetna are estimated to be approximately $400 million and $165 million, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, neither CVS Health nor Aetna incurred any material acquisition-related transaction costs.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 is required to include adjustments which give effect to
events that are directly attributable to the merger regardless of whether they are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results or are
non-recurring. Therefore, acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by CVS Health and Aetna subsequent to September 30, 2017 of
approximately $400 million and $165 million, respectively, are reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, with the after-tax impact presented as an increase to accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a
decrease to retained earnings.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any potential divestitures that may occur prior to, or subsequent
to, completion of the merger, or the projected realization of cost savings following completion of the merger. These cost savings opportunities are from
administrative cost savings as well as reduced health care costs due to medical management. Although CVS Health projects that cost savings will result
from the merger, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. The unaudited pro forma

Table of Contents

condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any projected pre-tax restructuring and integration-related costs associated with the projected
annual cost savings. The annual cost savings are projected to be approximately $750 million in the second full year following completion of the merger.
The restructuring and integration-related costs will be expensed in the appropriate accounting periods after completion of the merger.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect (a) any changes in applicable law (including applicable tax law)
after September 30, 2017 or (b) Aetna’s sale of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses on
November 1, 2017.

 
3. Accounting Policies

At completion of the merger, CVS Health will review Aetna’s accounting policies. As a result of that review, CVS Health may identify differences
between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the combined financial statements. With
the exception of one accounting policy related to recently issued accounting guidance that CVS Health early adopted in the first quarter of 2017 (see
Note 6(l)), CVS Health is not aware of any differences that would have a material impact on the combined financial statements, and therefore, the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume there are no other differences in accounting policies other than the one described
in Note 6(l).

 
4. Estimate of Consideration Expected to be Transferred

The following is a preliminary estimate of consideration expected to be transferred to effect the acquisition of Aetna:
 
   

(Millions, except per
common share data) 

Cash consideration:   
Shareholders:   
Aetna common shares outstanding    326.9 
Multiplied by merger agreement cash consideration per share paid to Aetna shareholders   $ 145.00 

    
 

Preliminary estimate of cash consideration paid to Aetna shareholders   $ 47,394 
    

 

Stock appreciation right holders:   
Aetna vested in-the-money stock appreciation rights    4.0 
Multiplied by merger consideration value of $211.01 less exercise price   $ 133.33 

    
 

Preliminary estimate of cash consideration paid to holders of vested Aetna stock
appreciation rights   $ 527 

    
 

RSU and PSU holders:   
Vested Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs    0.3 
Multiplied by merger agreement cash consideration per share paid to Aetna shareholders   $ 145.00 

    
 

Preliminary estimate of cash consideration paid to Aetna RSU and Aetna PSU holders   $ 46 
    

 

Preliminary fair value estimate of total cash consideration   $ 47,967 
    

 

Share consideration:   
Shareholders:   
Aetna common shares outstanding    326.9 
Multiplied by merger agreement per share exchange ratio    0.8378 
Multiplied by per share price of CVS Health common stock on February 1, 2018   $ 78.79 

    
 

Preliminary estimate of fair value of common stock issued to Aetna shareholders   $ 21,576

Table of Contents

   
(Millions, except per
common share data) 

RSU and PSU holders:   
Vested Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs    0.3 
Multiplied by merger agreement per share exchange ratio    0.8378 
Multiplied by per share price of CVS Health common stock on February 1, 2018   $ 78.79 

    
 

Preliminary estimate of fair value of common stock issued to Aetna RSU and Aetna PSU holders   $ 21 
    

 

Preliminary fair value estimate of total share consideration   $ 21,597 
    

 

Total consideration:   
Cash consideration   $ 47,967 
Common share consideration    21,597 
Other consideration transferred (a)    —   

    
 

Estimate of total consideration expected to be transferred (b)   $ 69,564 
    

 

 
Certain amounts may reflect rounding adjustments.
 

(a) As further described in Note 1. Description of Transaction, beginning on page 47 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, certain outstanding
equity awards granted to Aetna employees will not be settled upon completion of the merger, and instead will be converted into replacement
awards issued by CVS Health, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as replacement equity awards. The above table
excludes approximately 1.4 million aggregate Aetna RSUs and PSUs and approximately 3.3 million Aetna stock appreciation rights, each
outstanding at February 1, 2018, from the estimate of total consideration expected to be transferred. Other consideration transferred will include
the portion of the fair value of the replacement awards that is attributed to pre-merger services. The fair value attributable to post-merger services
will be recorded as compensation expense in CVS Health’s post-merger financial statements. At this time, CVS Health is unable to reasonably
estimate the respective amounts attributable to pre- and post-merger services.

 

(b) The estimated total consideration expected to be transferred reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements does
not purport to represent the actual consideration that will be transferred when the merger is completed. In accordance with ASC 805 the fair value
of equity securities issued as part of the consideration transferred will be measured on the date the merger is completed at the then-current market
price. This requirement will likely result in a different value of the common share component of the purchase consideration and a per Aetna share
equity component different from the $66.01 assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, and that difference
may be material. For example, if the per share price of CVS Health’s common stock on the date the merger is completed increased or decreased by
10% from the price assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the consideration transferred would increase
or decrease by approximately $2.2 billion, which would be reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements as an
increase or decrease to goodwill.

5. Estimate of Assets to be Acquired and Liabilities to be Assumed

The following is a preliminary estimate of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed by CVS Health in the merger, reconciled to
the estimate of total consideration expected to be transferred:
 

   

At
September 30,

2017  
   (Millions)  
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed:   
Historical net book value of net assets acquired   $ 15,818 
Less historical:   

Goodwill    (10,683) 
Intangible assets    (1,273) 
Debt issuance costs and net debt discounts/premiums    (45) 
Capitalized software    (719) 
Deferred acquisition costs    (497) 
Deferred tax assets on outstanding equity awards    (45) 
Deferred tax assets on debt premiums    (18) 
Deferred tax liabilities on deferred acquisition costs    168 
Deferred tax liabilities on historical capitalized software    258 
Deferred tax liabilities on historical intangible assets and tax deductible goodwill    759 

    
 

Adjusted book value of net assets acquired    3,723 
    

 

Adjustments to:   
Goodwill (c)    49,544 
Identifiable intangible assets (d)    27,845 
Deferred tax liabilities (e)    (10,475) 
Fair value adjustment to debt (f)    (838) 
Fair value of noncontrolling interest (g)    (235) 
Other (h)    —   

    
 

Total adjustments    65,841 
    

 

Consideration transferred   $ 69,564 
    

 

 
(c) Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the total consideration expected to be transferred and the

aggregate values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized.
 

(d) As of completion of the merger, identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value, and these acquired assets could include
assets that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use. For purposes of
these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and consistent with the ASC 820 requirements for fair value measurements, it
is assumed that all assets will be used, and that all acquired assets will be used in a manner that represents the highest and best use of those
acquired assets, but it is not assumed that any market participant synergies will be achieved.

 

    The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the “income approach,” which is based on the present
value of the future after-tax cash flows attributable to each identifiable intangible asset. Other valuation methods, including the market approach
and cost approach, were also considered in estimating the fair value. Under the HSR Act and other relevant laws and regulations, there are
significant limitations on CVS Health’s ability to obtain specific information about Aetna’s intangible assets prior to completion of the merger.

Table of Contents

    As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS Health does not have sufficient information as to the amount, timing and risk of the
cash flows from all of Aetna’s identifiable intangible assets to determine their fair value. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the
development of intangible asset values, from the perspective of a market participant, include, but are not limited to: the amount and timing of
projected future cash flows (including revenue and profitability); the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows;
the assessment of the asset’s life cycle; and the competitive trends impacting the asset. However, for purposes of these unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements and using publicly available information, such as historical revenues, Aetna’s cost structure, industry
information for comparable intangible assets and certain other high-level assumptions, the fair value of Aetna’s identifiable intangible assets and
their weighted average useful lives have been preliminarily estimated as follows:

These preliminary estimates of fair value and weighted average useful life will likely be different from the amounts included in the final
acquisition accounting, and the difference could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements. Once CVS Health has full access to information about Aetna’s intangible assets, additional insight will be gained that could impact
(i) the estimated total value assigned to identifiable intangible assets, (ii) the estimated allocation of value between finite-lived and indefinite-lived
intangible assets and/or (iii) the estimated weighted average useful life of each category of intangible assets. The estimated intangible asset values
and their useful lives could be impacted by a variety of factors that may become known to CVS Health only upon access to additional information
and/or by changes in such factors that may occur prior to completion of the merger. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the
regulatory, legislative, legal, technological and/or competitive environments. Increased knowledge about these and/or other elements could result
in a change to the estimated fair value of the identifiable Aetna intangible assets and/or to the estimated weighted average useful lives from what
CVS Health has assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The combined effect of any such changes could
then also result in a significant increase or decrease to CVS Health’s estimate of associated amortization expense.

 

(e) As of completion of the merger, CVS Health will establish net deferred tax liabilities and make other tax adjustments as part of the accounting for
the merger, primarily related to estimated fair value adjustments for identifiable intangible assets and debt (see (d) and (f)). The pro forma
adjustment to record the effect of deferred taxes was computed as follows:

 
   (Millions) 
Estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets to be acquired   $ 27,845 
Estimated fair value adjustment of debt to be assumed    (838) 

    
 

Total estimated fair value adjustments of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed   $ 27,007

(*) The tax impacts of the acquisition were estimated based on applicable law as in effect on September 30, 2017. CVS Health assumed a 39%
effective income tax rate when estimating the deferred tax impacts of the acquisition.

 

(f) As of completion of the merger, Aetna’s debt is required to be measured at fair value. CVS Health has calculated the pro forma adjustment using
publicly available information and believes the pro forma adjustment amount to be reasonable. This adjustment reflects the incremental fair value
of Aetna’s long-term debt over the par value of such debt.

 

(g) The net book value of Aetna’s noncontrolling interest is assumed to approximate its fair value in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
 

(h) As of completion of the merger, various other assets and liabilities are required to be measured at fair value, including, but not limited to: accounts
receivable, property and equipment, insurance liabilities, and legal contingencies. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS
Health does not have sufficient information to make a reasonable preliminary estimate of the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Accordingly,
for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, CVS Health has assumed that the historical Aetna book
values represent the best estimate of fair value.

 
6. Income Statement Pro Forma Adjustments
 

(i) For the year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017, CVS Health’s insurance premiums from its SilverScript
Insurance Company Medicare Part D prescription drug plan of $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, have been reclassified and presented
separately from net revenues from pharmacy, consumer products and other. The related costs and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2016
and the nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, have been reclassified and presented separately from
cost of revenues from pharmacy, consumer products and other. These reclassifications made in these pro forma condensed combined financial
statements were made to conform to Aetna’s insurance-related presentation.

 
(j) To eliminate pharmacy and clinical services revenue CVS Health earned from Aetna of $7,828 million and $6,713 million for the year ended

December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The related costs eliminated and their financial statement line
items are as follows:

 

   
Year Ended

December 31, 2016   

Nine
Months Ended

2017

Elimination of cost of revenues   $ 7,727   $ 6,627 
Elimination of administrative fees from selling, general and

administrative expenses    101    86 
    

 
    

 

Total elimination   $ 7,828   $ 6,713 
    

 

    

 

 

(k) For purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, this adjustment reflects CVS Health’s estimated forgone
interest income associated with adjusting the amortized cost of Aetna’s debt securities investment portfolio to fair value as of completion of the
merger. Forgone interest income due to the fair value adjustment to Aetna’s debt securities investment portfolio under the acquisition method of
accounting is projected to be approximately $131 million and $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, respectively.

 

(l) During the first quarter of 2017, CVS Health early adopted on a retrospective basis ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic
Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires entities to disaggregate the current service cost component
from the other

shareholders after the merger is completed could be greater than, less than or the same as shown in the table above. Accordingly, Aetna shareholders are
advised to obtain current market quotations for shares of CVS Health common stock and Aetna common shares in deciding whether to vote for approval
and adoption of the merger agreement.

Dividends

CVS Health currently pays a quarterly dividend on shares of CVS Health common stock and last paid a dividend on February 2, 2018 of $0.50 per
share. Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period before completion of the merger, CVS Health is not permitted to declare, set aside or
pay any dividend or other distribution other than its regular cash dividend in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in an amount
not to exceed $0.50 per share per quarter.

Aetna currently pays a quarterly dividend on Aetna common shares and last paid a dividend on January 26, 2018 of $0.50 per share. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, during the period before completion of the merger, Aetna is not permitted to declare, set aside or pay any dividend or
other distribution other than its regular cash dividend in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in an amount not to exceed
$0.50 per share per quarter.

In addition, the merger agreement provides that CVS Health and Aetna will coordinate the declaration of, record dates for and payment of
dividends in respect of their respective shares in order that holders of shares of CVS Health common stock and Aetna common shares do not receive two
dividends or fail to receive one dividend for any quarter in respect of Aetna common shares, on the one hand, and shares of CVS Health common stock
issuable in the merger, on the other hand.

After completion of the merger, each former Aetna shareholder who holds shares of CVS Health common stock into which Aetna common shares
have been converted in connection with the merger will receive whatever dividends are declared and paid on shares of CVS Health common stock.
However, no dividend or other distribution having a record date after completion of the merger will actually be paid with respect to any shares of CVS
Health common stock into which Aetna common shares have been converted in connection with the merger until the certificates formerly representing
Aetna common shares have been surrendered (or the book-entry shares formerly representing Aetna common shares have been transferred), at which
time any accrued dividends and other distributions on those shares of CVS Health common stock will be paid without interest. Subject to the limitations
set forth in the merger agreement described above, any future dividends by CVS Health will be made at the discretion of CVS Health’s board of
directors. Subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement described above, any future dividends by Aetna will be made at the discretion of
Aetna’s board of directors. There can be no assurance that any future dividends will be declared or paid by CVS Health or Aetna or as to the amount or
timing of those dividends, if any.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters
addressed in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 72 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you
should carefully consider the following risk factors in determining whether to vote for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement or approval
of the stock issuance. You also should read and consider the risk factors associated with each of the businesses of CVS Health and Aetna because these
risk factors may affect the operations and financial results of the combined company. These risk factors may be found under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk
Factors” in each company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by their respective Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, and future filings with the SEC, each of which is on file or will be filed with the SEC and all of which are incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of CVS Health common stock has fluctuated and will continue to
fluctuate, Aetna shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the merger.

Upon completion of the merger, each Aetna common share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than those
held by Aetna as treasury stock, by CVS Health or by any subsidiary of Aetna or CVS Health) will be converted into the right to receive $145.00 in cash
without interest thereon and 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock. Because the exchange ratio of 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common
stock is fixed, the value of the share consideration will depend on the market price of shares of CVS Health common stock at the time the merger is
completed. The market price of shares of CVS Health common stock has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and
will continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the date of the Aetna special meeting and the date the merger is
completed, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date of the Aetna special meeting, and thereafter. Accordingly, at the time of the
Aetna special meeting, Aetna shareholders will not know or be able to determine the market value of the merger consideration they would be entitled to
receive upon completion of the merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic
conditions, changes in CVS Health’s and Aetna’s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes
in market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the merger, and changes with
respect to expectations regarding the timing of the merger and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond CVS Health’s and Aetna’s
control. CVS Health stockholders and Aetna shareholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for shares of CVS Health common stock in
deciding whether to vote for the stock issuance or the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, as applicable.

The market price of shares of CVS Health common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those that are
currently affecting or historically have affected the market price of Aetna common shares.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of Aetna common shares will become holders of shares of CVS Health common stock. The market price
of CVS Health common stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the merger, and holders of Aetna common shares could lose the value
of their investment in CVS Health common stock. The issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger could on its own have the effect
of depressing the market price for CVS Health common stock. In addition, many Aetna shareholders may decide not to hold the shares of CVS Health
common stock they receive as a result of the merger. Other Aetna shareholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in
individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of CVS Health common stock they receive as a result of the merger. Any such sales of CVS Health
common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for CVS Health common stock.

Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the CVS Health common
stock, regardless of CVS Health’s actual operating performance.

The businesses of CVS Health differ from those of Aetna in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of CVS Health after the
merger, as well as the market price of shares of CVS Health common stock, may be affected by factors different from those that are currently affecting,
historically have affected or would in the future affect the results of operations of Aetna as a stand-alone public company, as well as the market price of
Aetna common shares. For further information on the respective businesses of CVS Health and Aetna and certain factors to consider in connection with
those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under “Where You Can Find
More Information” beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

After completion of the merger, CVS Health may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger, which could
adversely affect the value of shares of CVS Health common stock.

The success of the merger will depend, in part, on CVS Health’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the
businesses of CVS Health and Aetna. CVS Health’s ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks, including:
 

 •  CVS Health’s ability to successfully combine the businesses of CVS Health and Aetna;
 

 •  whether the combined businesses will perform as expected;
 

 •  the possibility that CVS Health paid more for Aetna than the value CVS Health will derive from the acquisition;
 

 •  the reduction of CVS Health’s cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition; and
 

 •  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Aetna.

If CVS Health is not able to successfully combine the businesses of CVS Health and Aetna within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the
anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses
may not perform as expected and the value of the shares of CVS Health common stock may be adversely affected.

CVS Health and Aetna have operated and, until completion of the merger will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances
that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key CVS Health or Aetna
employees, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected
integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be
addressed in integrating the operations of Aetna and CVS Health in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so the combined business
performs as expected include, among other things:
 

 •  combining the companies’ separate operational, financial, reporting and corporate functions;
 

 •  integrating the companies’ technologies, products and services;
 

 •  identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
 

 
•  harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development, compensation and benefit programs, internal controls and other

policies, procedures and processes;
 

 •  addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;
 

 •  consolidating the companies’ corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;

 •  coordinating sales, distribution and marketing efforts;
 

 •  managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations;
 

 
•  maintaining existing agreements with customers, providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with

prospective customers, providers and vendors;
 

 •  operating in industry sectors in which CVS Health and its current management may have little or no experience;
 

 •  coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;
 

 •  consolidating offices of Aetna and CVS Health that are currently in or near the same location; and
 

 •  effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.

In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of each company’s management and each company’s resources may be focused on
completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may
disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.

CVS Health has limited experience in the insurance and managed health care industry, which may hinder CVS Health’s ability to achieve
the combined company’s objectives.

CVS Health has limited experience operating an insurance and managed health care business, and will rely in large part on the existing
management of Aetna to continue to manage the Aetna business following the merger. However, there is no assurance that CVS Health will be able to
retain the services of such management. If CVS Health fails to retain the existing management of Aetna, CVS Health’s ability to realize the anticipated
benefits of the transaction may be adversely affected.

CVS Health and Aetna may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger.

As CVS Health will be operating in industry sectors for which its existing management team has little or no experience, CVS Health’s success
after the transaction will depend in part on the ability of CVS Health to retain key executives and other employees of Aetna. Uncertainty about the effect
of the merger on CVS Health and Aetna employees may have an adverse effect on each of CVS Health and Aetna separately and consequently the
combined business. This uncertainty may impair CVS Health’s and/or Aetna’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention
may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees of CVS Health and Aetna may experience uncertainty about their
future roles in the combined business.

Additionally, Aetna’s officers and employees may hold Aetna common shares, as well as Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs and Aetna
PSUs that are subject to accelerated vesting on a change in control, and, if the merger is completed, these officers and employees may be entitled to cash
and/or the merger consideration in respect of such Aetna common shares, stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs. These payouts could
also make retention of these officers and employees more difficult. Additionally, pursuant to employment agreements and/or other agreements or
arrangements with Aetna, certain key employees of Aetna are entitled to receive severance payments upon a termination without cause and/or a
resignation for “good reason” following completion of the merger. Under these agreements, certain key employees of Aetna potentially could resign
from his or her employment following specified circumstances set forth in his or her applicable agreement, including an adverse change in his or her
title, authority or responsibilities, compensation and benefits or primary office location.

Furthermore, if key employees of CVS Health or Aetna depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty
and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become

Table of Contents

employees of the combined business, CVS Health may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining
replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of Aetna, and CVS Health’s ability to realize
the anticipated benefits of the merger may be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that CVS Health will be able to
attract or retain key employees of Aetna to the same extent that Aetna has been able to attract or retain employees in the past.

In order to complete the merger, CVS Health and Aetna must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are
not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the merger may be jeopardized or prevented or
the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced.

Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act
and certain other applicable laws or regulations and the required governmental authorizations having been obtained and being in full force and effect.
Although CVS Health and Aetna have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain
governmental filings or obtain the required governmental authorizations, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods
will expire or authorizations will be obtained and no assurance that the merger will be completed.

In addition, the governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws
and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the merger, including other potential transactions in
the health care industry or other industries. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the
merger. As a condition to authorization of the merger or related transactions, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations
or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of CVS Health’s business after completion of the merger. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, CVS Health is not required, and Aetna is not permitted without CVS Health’s consent, to take any actions or agree to any terms or conditions
in connection with (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act, (ii) any other antitrust law or
(iii) the required governmental authorizations, in each case if such action, term or condition would have, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or Aetna (see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 181 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the definition of regulatory material
adverse effect).

However, notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement, either CVS Health or Aetna could become subject to terms or conditions in
connection with such waiting periods, laws or other authorizations (whether because such term or condition does not rise to the specified level of
materiality or CVS Health otherwise consents to its imposition) the imposition of which could adversely affect CVS Health’s ability to integrate Aetna’s
operations with CVS Health’s operations, reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger or otherwise materially and adversely affect CVS Health’s
business and results of operations after completion of the merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” and “The
Merger Agreement—Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant” beginning on pages 181 and 194, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

In addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations, completion of the merger is subject to a number of other conditions, and if
these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed.

The obligations of CVS Health and Aetna to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions in addition to
receipt of certain governmental authorizations, including, among other conditions: (i) approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna
shareholders at the Aetna special

meeting, (ii) approval of the stock issuance by CVS Health stockholders at the CVS Health special meeting, (iii) approval for the listing on the NYSE of
the shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued in the merger, (iv) absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the
transaction, (v) declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and
absence of any stop order suspending such effectiveness and any proceedings for such purpose pending before the SEC, (vi) accuracy of the
representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality qualifications, (vii) performance in all
material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the transaction, and (viii) the
absence of a material adverse effect on the other party (see “The Merger Agreement—Definition of ‘Material Adverse Effect’” beginning on page 184
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the definition of material adverse effect). For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be
satisfied or waived prior to completion of the merger, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 181 of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the
merger will be completed.

In addition, the CVS Health special meeting and the Aetna special meeting may take place before certain governmental authorizations have been
obtained and, therefore, before the terms on which such governmental authorizations may be obtained, or the conditions to obtaining such governmental
authorizations that may be imposed, are known. As a result, if CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance at the CVS Health special meeting,
or Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement at the Aetna special meeting, CVS Health and Aetna may make decisions after the
respective meetings to waive a condition as to the receipt of certain governmental authorizations or to take certain actions required to obtain such
governmental authorizations without seeking further stockholder or shareholder approval, as applicable, and such actions could have an adverse effect
on the combined company.

CVS Health’s and Aetna’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger.

Parties with which CVS Health or Aetna does business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger, including with respect to current or
future business relationships with CVS Health, Aetna or the combined business. CVS Health’s and Aetna’s business relationships may be subject to
disruption as customers, providers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into
business relationships with parties other than CVS Health, Aetna or the combined business. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on
the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of CVS Health, Aetna and/or the combined business, including a material adverse
effect on CVS Health’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a
delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

Certain of Aetna’s executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that may be different from your interests as a shareholder
of Aetna.

When considering the recommendation of Aetna’s board of directors that Aetna shareholders vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement, Aetna shareholders should be aware that certain of the executive officers and directors of Aetna have interests in the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Aetna shareholders generally. These include, among others, continuing service on the CVS Health
board of directors for Mr. Bertolini and two other individuals who are serving on the Aetna board of directors immediately prior to completion of the
merger, payments pursuant to certain equity awards, severance payments upon qualifying terminations and rights to continuing indemnification and
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. See “Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 209 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed description of these interests. Aetna’s board of directors and CVS Health’s board of directors were aware
of these interests and considered them, among other things, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and in recommending that Aetna
shareholders

approve and adopt the merger agreement and that the CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance, respectively.

The merger agreement contains provisions that may make it more difficult for CVS Health and Aetna to pursue alternatives to the
merger.

The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Aetna to sell its business to a party other than CVS Health, or for CVS
Health to sell its business. These provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any acquisition proposal. Further, there are only
limited exceptions to each party’s agreement that its board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the
recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, in the case of Aetna, or the approval of the
stock issuance, in the case of CVS Health, and the other party generally has a right to match any acquisition proposal that may be made. However, at any
time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders, in the case of Aetna, or the approval of the stock issuance by
CVS Health stockholders, in the case of CVS Health, such party’s board of directors is permitted to take certain of these actions if it determines in good
faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. See “The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on pages 190 and 205, respectively, of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions might discourage a third party that has
an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either Aetna or CVS Health from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if that party were
prepared to pay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed merger consideration, in the case of Aetna, or that party were
prepared to enter into an agreement that may be favorable to CVS Health or its stockholders, in the case of CVS Health. Furthermore, the termination
fees described below may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per-share price to acquire the applicable party than it might
otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable by such party in certain circumstances.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of CVS Health and
Aetna.

If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Aetna shareholders failing to approve and adopt the merger agreement or
CVS Health stockholders failing to approve the stock issuance, the ongoing businesses of CVS Health and Aetna may be materially and adversely
affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, CVS Health and Aetna would be subject to a number of risks,
including the following:
 

 
•  CVS Health and Aetna may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of CVS

Health common stock, Aetna common shares and both companies’ other securities, and from their respective customers, providers, vendors,
regulators and employees;

 

 

•  Aetna may be required to pay CVS Health a termination fee of $2.1 billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances, and CVS Health may be required to pay Aetna a termination fee of $2.1 billion if the merger agreement is terminated under
certain other circumstances (see “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 205 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus);

 

 
•  CVS Health and Aetna will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs incurred in connection with the merger, whether

or not the merger is completed;
 

 
•  the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Aetna’s and CVS Health’s businesses prior to completion of the merger,

and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to

the consent of the other party, may prevent Aetna and CVS Health from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or
otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that Aetna or CVS Health would have made, taken or pursued
if these restrictions were not in place (see “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger” beginning on page 185 of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Aetna and CVS Health); and

 

 

•  matters relating to the merger (including arranging permanent financing and integration planning) will require substantial commitments of
time and resources by CVS Health and Aetna management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which
would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either CVS Health or
Aetna as an independent company.

There can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely
affect CVS Health’s and/or Aetna’s businesses, financial condition, financial results, ratings, stock prices and/or bond prices.

In addition, CVS Health and Aetna could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any proceeding to
specifically enforce CVS Health’s or Aetna’s obligation to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not
completed, these risks may materialize and may materially and adversely affect CVS Health’s and/or Aetna’s businesses, financial condition, financial
results, ratings, stock prices and/or bond prices.

The shares of CVS Health common stock to be received by Aetna shareholders upon completion of the merger will have different rights
from Aetna common shares.

Upon completion of the merger, Aetna shareholders will no longer be shareholders of Aetna, a Pennsylvania corporation, but will instead become
stockholders of CVS Health, a Delaware corporation, and their rights as CVS Health stockholders will be governed by Delaware law and the terms of
CVS Health’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation, and CVS Health’s amended and restated by-laws, as they may be amended from time
to time, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as CVS Health’s by-laws. Delaware law and the terms of CVS Health’s certificate
of incorporation and CVS Health’s by-laws are in some respects materially different than Pennsylvania law and the terms of Aetna’s articles and Aetna’s
amended and restated by-laws, as they may be amended from time to time, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Aetna’s
by-laws, which currently govern the rights of Aetna shareholders. See “Comparison of Stockholder Rights” beginning on page 225 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for a discussion of the different rights associated with Aetna common shares and shares of CVS Health common stock.

Current CVS Health stockholders and Aetna shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will
exercise less influence over the management of the combined company.

Upon completion of the merger, CVS Health expects to issue approximately 280 million shares of CVS Health common stock to Aetna
shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. As a result, it is expected that, immediately after completion of
the merger, former Aetna shareholders will own approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of CVS Health common stock. Consequently, current
CVS Health stockholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the management and policies of CVS Health than they currently have over the
management and policies of CVS Health, and Aetna shareholders in the aggregate will have significantly less influence over the management and
policies of CVS Health than they currently have over the management and policies of Aetna.

Lawsuits have been filed against Aetna and its board of directors and other lawsuits may be filed against Aetna, CVS Health and/or their
respective boards of directors challenging the merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being completed.

As of February 8, 2018, seven complaints had been filed by purported Aetna shareholders challenging the merger. The first, a putative class action
complaint, was filed by Olivier Miramond in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned Miramond v. Aetna, Inc., et
al., case number 3:18-cv-00083. The second complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by Shiva Stein
individually, is captioned Stein v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00136. The third complaint, a putative class action, was filed by Robert
Freedman in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and is captioned Freedman v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 2:18-
cv-00323. The fourth complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by Luan Pham individually, is captioned Pham v.
Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00154. The fifth complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by
Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust individually, is captioned Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. Aetna Inc. et al., case number 2:18-cv-00361. The sixth
complaint, a putative class action complaint, was filed by Dr. Eli Inzlicht-Sprei in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is
captioned Inzlicht-Sprei v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00176. The seventh complaint, a putative class action complaint, was filed by Joel
Rosenfeld in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned Rosenfeld v. Aetna, Inc. et al., case number 3:18-cv-00213.
The complaints name as defendants Aetna and each member of Aetna’s board of directors. In addition, the Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust complaint
names CVS Health and Merger Sub as defendants. The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the merger consideration in the proposed
transaction is unfair, inadequate and undervalues Aetna; that the defendants failed to conduct a fair and reasonable sales process; that the merger
agreement’s deal protection provisions improperly deter other suitors from submitting a superior offer for Aetna; that Aetna’s board of directors and
executive officers are conflicted because they have secured unique benefits for themselves from the proposed transaction not available to Aetna
shareholders generally; and that the defendants authorized the filing of a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement. Among other
remedies, the complaints seek to enjoin the Aetna special meeting and the closing of the merger, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. Defendants believe
that the complaints are without merit.

See “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Litigation
Relating to the Merger” beginning on page 176 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for more information about litigation related to the merger that
has been commenced prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. There can be no assurance that additional complaints will not be filed
with respect to the merger.

One of the conditions to completion of the merger is the absence of any applicable law (including any order) being in effect that prohibits
completion of the merger. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an order prohibiting completion of the merger, then such order may
prevent the merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.

The indebtedness of CVS Health following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than CVS Health’s indebtedness on a
stand-alone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of CVS Health and Aetna existing prior to the announcement of the merger
agreement. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect CVS Health’s business flexibility, and increase its borrowing costs.
Downgrades in CVS Health’s and/or Aetna’s ratings could adversely affect CVS Health’s, Aetna’s and/or the combined company’s respective
businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.

Upon completion of the merger, CVS Health expects to incur acquisition-related debt financing of approximately $45.0 billion and assume
Aetna’s existing indebtedness of approximately $8.2 billion. CVS Health’s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio
following completion of the merger in comparison to that of CVS Health prior to the merger will have the effect, among other things, of reducing CVS

indebtedness levels and thus the demands on CVS Health’s cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service the
indebtedness of CVS Health or Aetna individually prior to the merger. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available to fund
CVS Health’s efforts to combine its business with Aetna and realize expected benefits of the merger and/or engage in investments in product
development, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for CVS Health
relative to other companies with lower debt levels.

In addition, CVS Health’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, CVS Health’s cost of capital. CVS
Health’s ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of CVS Health’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet CVS Health’s
debt obligations or, following completion of the merger, obligations to the combined company’s insureds. Each of the ratings organizations reviews CVS
Health’s and Aetna’s ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that CVS Health’s or Aetna’s current ratings will be maintained in the future.
Following the announcement of the merger agreement, each of Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s placed certain of CVS Health’s debt, financial strength
and other credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, Standard & Poor’s, A.M. Best
and Fitch placed Aetna’s debt, financial strength and other credit ratings under review with negative implications. Downgrades in CVS Health’s and/or
Aetna’s ratings could adversely affect CVS Health’s, Aetna’s and/or the combined company’s businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating
results. In addition, if the merger is completed and, in certain circumstances, Aetna’s debt securities are rated below investment grade, this may
constitute a change of control triggering event under the indentures governing such debt. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event,
Aetna, as the surviving corporation of the merger, would be required to offer to repurchase most of Aetna’s outstanding notes at 101% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase. However, it is possible that Aetna (or CVS Health)
would not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in other
debt instruments would not allow such repurchases. CVS Health and Aetna cannot provide any assurance that there will be sufficient funds available for
Aetna (or CVS Health) to make any required repurchases of the notes upon a change of control triggering event.

CVS Health will incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with the merger.

CVS Health expects to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two companies.
CVS Health will incur significant transaction costs related to the merger, including with respect to the financing for the cash consideration to be paid to
Aetna shareholders. CVS Health also will incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans,
including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. CVS Health continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and
additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies’ businesses. Although CVS Health expects that
the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow CVS Health
to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.

The merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to CVS Health’s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price
of shares of CVS Health common stock.

CVS Health currently projects that the merger will result in a number of benefits, including enhanced competitive positioning and a platform from
which to accelerate growth, and that it will be accretive to earnings per share in the second full year after the close of the transaction. This projection is
based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay the accretion that is
currently projected or could result in dilution, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration-related costs and
other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of

the merger. Any dilution of, decrease in or delay of any accretion to, CVS Health’s earnings per share could cause the price of shares of CVS Health
common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information and prospective financial information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual financial position or results of operations of
the combined company following completion of the merger or reflect the effect of any divestitures that may be required in connection with the
merger.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information and prospective financial information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
is presented for illustrative purposes only, contains a variety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and does not represent the actual
financial position or results of operations of CVS Health and Aetna prior to the merger or that of the combined company following the merger for
several reasons. Among other things, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect the effect of any potential divestitures that
may occur prior to or subsequent to completion of the merger, the projected realization of cost savings following completion of the merger, any changes
in applicable law (including applicable tax law) after September 30, 2017, Aetna’s sale of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance
and absence management businesses on November 1, 2017, or CVS Health’s projected reduction of its adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio following
completion of the merger. See the sections entitled “CVS Health and Aetna Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements”, “Aetna
Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” and “Comparative Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Per Share Data” beginning on pages 42, 155 and 40,
respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The actual financial positions and results of operations of Aetna and CVS Health prior to the
merger and that of the combined company following the merger may not be consistent with, or evident from, the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information or prospective financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the assumptions used in
preparing the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and/or the prospective financial information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus may not be realized and may be affected by other factors. Any significant changes in the market price of shares of CVS Health
common stock may cause a significant change in the purchase price used for CVS Health’s accounting purposes and the pro forma combined financial
information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its
expanded operations following completion of the merger.

Following completion of the merger, the size of the combined company’s business will be significantly larger than the current size of either CVS
Health’s or Aetna’s respective businesses. The combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon
management’s ability to implement an effective integration of the two companies and its ability to manage a combined business with significantly larger
size and scope with the associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the management of the combined company will be
successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the
merger.

Risks relating to CVS Health and Aetna.

CVS Health and Aetna are, and following completion of the merger CVS Health will continue to be, subject to the risks described in Part I,
Item 1A in CVS Health’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2017, and Part I,

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OF CVS HEALTH

CVS Health is providing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted
at the CVS Health special meeting of stockholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) that CVS Health has called to consider and
vote on a proposal to approve the stock issuance and a proposal to approve the adjournment from time to time of the CVS Health special
meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the CVS Health special meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, to approve the stock issuance.

Date, Time and Location

Together with this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS Health is also sending CVS Health stockholders a notice of the CVS Health special
meeting and a form of proxy card that is solicited by CVS Health’s board of directors for use at the CVS Health special meeting to be held on March 13,
2018, at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, located at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and any
adjournments or postponements of the CVS Health special meeting.

Only stockholders or their proxy holders may attend the CVS Health special meeting.

If you plan to attend the CVS Health special meeting, please be prepared to provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver’s
license or a passport) to be admitted to the CVS Health special meeting.

If you are a beneficial owner of shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record at
the record date (the close of business on February 5, 2018), in addition to proper identification, you will also need an account statement or letter from
the nominee indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares at the record date to be admitted to the CVS Health special meeting. If you want
to vote your shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street name” in person at the CVS Health special meeting, you will have to obtain a written
legal proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that holds your shares.

Purpose

At the CVS Health special meeting, CVS Health stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve the stock issuance; and
 

 •  to approve the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

Under CVS Health’s by-laws, the business to be conducted at the CVS Health special meeting will be limited to the proposals set forth in the
notice to CVS Health stockholders provided with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendations of the CVS Health Board of Directors

CVS Health’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger and the stock issuance, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of CVS Health and its stockholders. CVS Health’s board of
directors unanimously recommends that CVS Health stockholders vote “FOR” the stock issuance. CVS Health’s board of directors further unanimously
recommends that CVS Health stockholders vote “FOR” the CVS Health adjournment proposal. See “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the

Directors that CVS Health Stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance” beginning on page 107 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more
detailed discussion of the recommendation of CVS Health’s board of directors that CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance.

CVS Health Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Stockholders Entitled to Vote

CVS Health’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on February 5, 2018, as the record date for the determination of the CVS Health
stockholders entitled to vote at the CVS Health special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the CVS Health special meeting. Only CVS
Health stockholders of record at the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the CVS Health special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. As of the close of business on February 5, 2018, there were 1,015,460,751 shares of CVS Health common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the CVS Health special meeting, held by approximately 21,454 holders of record.

Quorum

The presence at the CVS Health special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of CVS Health
common stock at the record date (the close of business on February 5, 2018) will constitute a quorum. Elections to abstain from voting will be deemed
present at the CVS Health special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street
name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, and shares of
CVS Health common stock with respect to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be deemed present at the CVS Health special
meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for the vote on the stock issuance to be taken at the CVS
Health special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the CVS Health special meeting will necessitate an adjournment of the meeting and will
subject CVS Health to additional expense.

Required Vote

Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the stock issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the CVS Health
special meeting by holders of shares of CVS Health common stock. CVS Health cannot complete the merger unless its stockholders approve the
stock issuance. Under the current rules and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast” on the stock issuance consist of votes “for” or “against” as
well as elections to abstain from voting. As a result, a CVS Health stockholder’s election to abstain from voting on the stock issuance will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, the failure of a CVS Health stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street
name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any
other failure of a CVS Health stockholder to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the stock issuance because these failures to
vote are not considered “votes cast.”

Approval of the CVS Health adjournment proposal, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast at the CVS Health special meeting by CVS Health stockholders. For purposes of the CVS Health adjournment proposal, “votes cast” means votes
“for” or “against” the proposal. As a result, a CVS Health stockholder’s election to abstain from voting on the CVS Health adjournment proposal, the
failure of a CVS Health stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give
voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a CVS Health stockholder to vote will have no effect on
the outcome of any vote on the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

Stock Ownership of and Voting by CVS Health Directors and Executive Officers

At the record date for the CVS Health special meeting (the close of business on February 5, 2018), CVS Health’s directors and executive officers
and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the

aggregate 1,279,586 shares of CVS Health common stock at the CVS Health special meeting, which represents approximately 0.13% of the shares of
CVS Health common stock entitled to vote at the CVS Health special meeting.

Each of CVS Health’s directors and executive officers is expected, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, to vote his or her shares
of CVS Health common stock “FOR” the stock issuance and “FOR” the CVS Health adjournment proposal, although none of CVS Health’s directors
and executive officers has entered into any agreement requiring them to do so.

register your vote via the Internet or telephone whenever possible. If you submit a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, please do not return your
proxy card by mail. If you attend the CVS Health special meeting, you may also vote in person. Any votes that you previously submitted—whether via

If you hold shares of CVS Health common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must obtain a
written legal proxy from that institution and present it to the judge of election with your ballot to be able to vote in person at the CVS Health special
meeting. To request a legal proxy, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record.

By Participants in the CVS Health 401(k) Plan

Participants in the CVS Health 401(k) Plan who receive this joint proxy statement/prospectus in their capacity as participants in the CVS Health
401(k) Plan are entitled to vote using the enclosed proxy card. The proxy card directs the trustee of the CVS Health 401(k) Plan to vote a participant’s
shares as indicated on the card. Shares of CVS Health common stock held through the CVS Health 401(k) Plan for which no instructions are received
will be voted by the trustee of the CVS Health 401(k) Plan in the same percentage as the shares of CVS Health common stock held through the CVS
Health 401(k) Plan for which the trustee receives voting instructions. The trustee of the CVS Health 401(k) Plan must receive voting instructions from
participants by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 8, 2018. Participants cannot vote the shares of CVS Health common stock they hold through the
CVS Health 401(k) Plan in person at the CVS Health special meeting.

Generally

If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must instruct the broker, bank
or other nominee holder of record on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will vote your shares only if you
provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record with
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record who hold shares of CVS Health common stock in “street
name” typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions on how to vote from the
beneficial owner. However, brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record typically are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters
that are “non-routine” without specific instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, both proposals to be
considered at the CVS Health special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are considered non-routine. Therefore, brokers,
banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal. A beneficial owner’s failure to instruct the
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record how to vote shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street name” will have no effect on the
proposal to approve the stock issuance or the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that are present in person or represented by proxy at the
CVS Health special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record is not instructed by the beneficial owner of
such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record does not have discretionary voting power on
such proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to either of the
proposals to be considered at the CVS Health special meeting, if a beneficial owner of shares of CVS Health common stock held in “street name” does
not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by
proxy at the CVS Health special meeting. As a result, there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with either of the proposals to be considered
at the CVS Health special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

All shares represented by each properly completed and valid proxy received before or at the CVS Health special meeting will be voted in
accordance with the instructions given in the proxy. If a CVS Health stockholder signs a proxy card and returns it without giving instructions for voting
on any proposal, the shares of CVS Health common stock represented by that proxy card will be voted “FOR” the stock issuance and “FOR” the CVS
Health adjournment proposal.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend the CVS Health special
meeting in person, please vote or otherwise submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented
and voted at the CVS Health special meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee holder of record, please
follow the instructions on the voting instruction form furnished to you by such record holder.

Revocability of Proxies; Changing Your Vote

You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before the closing of the polls at the CVS Health special meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record at the record date (the close of business on February 5, 2018), you can revoke your proxy or change your vote by:
 

 
•  sending a signed notice stating that you revoke your proxy to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by mail at 51

Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 or by fax at (631) 254-7733 that bears a date later than the date of the proxy you want to revoke and
is received prior to the CVS Health special meeting;

 

 
•  submitting a valid, later-dated proxy via the Internet or telephone before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 12, 2018, or by mail that is

received prior to the CVS Health special meeting; or
 

 
•  attending the CVS Health special meeting (or, if the CVS Health special meeting is adjourned or postponed, attending the adjourned or

postponed meeting) and voting in person, which automatically will cancel any proxy previously given, or revoking your proxy in person, but
your attendance at the CVS Health special meeting alone will not revoke any proxy previously given.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must contact your broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record to change your vote or obtain a written legal proxy to vote your shares if you wish to cast your vote in person at the CVS
Health special meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies; Expenses of Solicitation

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to holders of shares of CVS Health common stock in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by CVS Health’s board of directors to be voted at the CVS Health special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the CVS Health
special meeting. CVS Health will bear all costs and expenses in connection with the solicitation of proxies, including the costs of filing, printing and
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the CVS Health special meeting. CVS Health has engaged Okapi Partners LLC to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the CVS Health special meeting and will pay Okapi Partners LLC an initial retainer of $20,000 and additional fees to be
determined at the conclusion of the solicitation plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of CVS Health or its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from stockholders by
telephone, telegram, email, personal interview or other means. CVS Health currently expects not to incur any costs beyond those customarily expended
for a solicitation of proxies in connection with approval of any issuance of shares of CVS Health common stock. Directors, officers and employees of
CVS Health will not receive additional compensation for their solicitation activities, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with the solicitation. Brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies, fiduciaries, custodians and other nominees
have been requested to forward proxy solicitation materials to their customers, and such nominees will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

Householding

The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of annual reports and proxy statements. It permits CVS Health, with your permission, to send
a single notice of meeting and, to the extent requested, a single copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any household at which two or more
CVS Health stockholders reside if they

appear to be members of the same family. This rule is called “householding,” and its purpose is to help reduce printing and mailing costs of proxy
materials.

A number of brokerage firms have instituted householding for shares held in “street name.” If you and members of your household have multiple
accounts holding shares of CVS Health common stock, you may have received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker
directly if you have questions, require additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or wish to revoke your decision to household. These
options are available to you at any time.

Adjournment

CVS Health stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give CVS Health’s board of directors authority to adjourn from time to
time the CVS Health special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the approval of the stock issuance if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the CVS Health special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, to approve the stock issuance. If the CVS
Health adjournment proposal is approved, the CVS Health special meeting could be adjourned to any date. In addition, CVS Health’s board of directors,
with or without stockholder approval, could postpone the CVS Health special meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies or for other reasons. If the CVS Health special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who
have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how
you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the approval of the stock issuance but do not indicate a choice on
the CVS Health adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the CVS Health adjournment proposal. But if you indicate that you wish to
vote against the approval of the stock issuance, your shares will only be voted in favor of the CVS Health adjournment proposal if you indicate that you
wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

Other Information

The matters to be considered at the CVS Health special meeting are of great importance to the stockholders of CVS Health. Accordingly, you are
urged to read and carefully consider the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus and submit your
proxy via the Internet or by telephone or complete, date, sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you
submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone, you do not need to return the enclosed proxy card.

SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF AETNA

Aetna is providing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the
Aetna special meeting of shareholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) that Aetna has called to consider and vote on (i) a
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (ii) a proposal to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Aetna special
meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and (iii) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Aetna to its named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Date, Time and Location

Together with this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Aetna is also sending Aetna shareholders a notice of the Aetna special meeting and a form of
proxy card that is solicited by Aetna’s board of directors for use at the Aetna special meeting to be held on March 13, 2018, at the offices of Davis Polk
& Wardwell LLP, located at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and any adjournments or postponements of the
Aetna special meeting.

Only shareholders or their proxy holders may attend the Aetna special meeting. If you hold shares in your name at the record date and plan to
attend the Aetna special meeting, because of security procedures, you will need to obtain an admission ticket in advance. In addition to obtaining an
admission ticket in advance, you will be required to provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver’s license or a passport) to be
admitted to the Aetna special meeting. You may apply for an admission ticket by mail to Office of the Corporate Secretary, 151 Farmington Avenue,
RW61, Hartford, CT 06156 or by facsimile to (860) 293-1361. Ticket requests will not be accepted by phone or email. Aetna’s Corporate Secretary must
receive your request for an admission ticket on or before March 6, 2018.

If you are a beneficial owner of Aetna common shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record at the record date
(the close of business on February 5, 2018), and you plan to attend the Aetna special meeting, in addition to following the security procedures described
above, you will also need proof of beneficial ownership at the record date to obtain your admission ticket to the Aetna special meeting. A brokerage
statement or letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of beneficial ownership. If you wish to vote your Aetna common shares held in “street
name” in person at the Aetna special meeting, you will have to obtain a written legal proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee holder
of record that holds your shares.

Purpose

At the Aetna special meeting, Aetna shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve and adopt the merger agreement;
 

 •  to approve the Aetna adjournment proposal; and
 

 •  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Under Aetna’s by-laws, the business to be conducted at the Aetna special meeting will be limited to the proposals set forth in the notice to Aetna
shareholders provided with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendations of the Aetna Board of Directors

Aetna’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
(including the merger) are fair to and in the best interests of Aetna and its

shareholders. Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement. Aetna’s board of directors further unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote “FOR” the Aetna adjournment proposal and
“FOR” the Aetna compensation advisory proposal. See “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal
I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Aetna’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Aetna Board of Directors that Aetna Shareholders
Approve and Adopt the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 101 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the
recommendation of Aetna’s board of directors that Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. See “Aetna Proposal II: Adjournment
of the Aetna Special Meeting” beginning on page 219 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the Aetna adjournment
proposal. See “Aetna Proposal III: Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 220 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Aetna Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shareholders Entitled to Vote

A committee of Aetna’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on February 5, 2018, as the record date for the determination of the
Aetna shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Aetna special meeting.
Only Aetna shareholders of record at the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the Aetna special meeting. As of the close of business on February 5, 2018, there were 326,942,525 Aetna common shares outstanding
and entitled to vote at the Aetna special meeting, held by approximately 6,100 holders of record.

Quorum

The presence at the Aetna special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Aetna common shares at the
record date (the close of business on February 5, 2018) will constitute a quorum. Aetna common shares whose holders elect to abstain from voting will
be deemed present at the Aetna special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Aetna common shares held in “street name”
with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, and Aetna common
shares with respect to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be deemed present at the Aetna special meeting for the purpose of
determining the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for the vote on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the vote on the
Aetna compensation advisory proposal to be taken at the Aetna special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the Aetna special meeting will
necessitate an adjournment of the meeting and will subject Aetna to additional expense.

Required Vote

Pursuant to Aetna’s articles, to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of Aetna common shares
outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required. Aetna cannot complete the merger and the merger consideration will not be paid unless its
shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement. Because approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of Aetna common shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, an Aetna shareholder’s abstention from
voting, the failure of an Aetna shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

To approve (i) the Aetna adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum, as defined under Pennsylvania law, is present) and (ii) on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal (assuming

Table of Contents

a quorum, as defined under Pennsylvania law, is present), the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Aetna special meeting by holders of
Aetna common shares is required. For purposes of each of the Aetna adjournment proposal and the Aetna compensation advisory proposal, “votes cast”
means votes “for” or “against” the applicable proposal. As a result, an Aetna shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Aetna shareholder
who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or
other nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Aetna shareholder to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Aetna
adjournment proposal or any vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Share Ownership of and Voting by Aetna Directors and Executive Officers

At the record date for the Aetna special meeting (the close of business on February 5, 2018), Aetna’s directors and executive officers and their
affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the aggregate 1,357,761 Aetna common shares at the Aetna special meeting, which represents
approximately 0.42% of the Aetna common shares entitled to vote at the Aetna special meeting.

Each of Aetna’s directors and executive officers is expected, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, to vote his or her Aetna
common shares “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the Aetna adjournment proposal and “FOR” the Aetna
compensation advisory proposal, although none of Aetna’s directors or executive officers has entered into any agreement requiring them to do so.

Voting of Shares

Via the Internet or by Telephone

If you hold Aetna common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may vote via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com or by
telephone by calling (800) 690-6903 toll-free. In order to vote your shares via the Internet or by telephone, you will need the control number on your
proxy card (which is unique to each Aetna shareholder to ensure all voting instructions are genuine and to prevent duplicate voting). Votes may be
submitted via the Internet or by telephone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and must be received by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 12, 2018.

If you hold Aetna common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you may provide voting instructions
via the Internet or by telephone only if Internet or telephone voting is made available by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record. Please
follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record with these materials.

By Mail

If you hold Aetna common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, in order to vote by mail, you may submit a proxy card. You
will need to complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it using the postage-paid return envelope provided or return it to Vote Processing, c/o
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. Broadridge must receive your proxy card no later than the close
of business on March 12, 2018.

If you hold Aetna common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, in order to provide voting
instructions by mail you will need to complete, sign and date the voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record with these materials and return it in the postage-paid return envelope provided. Your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record must receive
your voting instruction form in sufficient time to vote your shares.

In Person

If you hold Aetna common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Aetna special meeting.
Shareholders of record also may be represented by another person at the Aetna

special meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that person and having that proper proxy be presented to the judge of election with the
applicable ballot at the Aetna special meeting.

When a shareholder of record submits a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, his or her proxy is recorded immediately. You are encouraged to
register your vote via the Internet or telephone whenever possible. If you submit a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, please do not return your
proxy card by mail. If you attend the Aetna special meeting, you may also vote in person, in which case any votes that you previously submitted—
whether via the Internet, by telephone or by mail—will be revoked and superseded by any vote that you cast at the Aetna special meeting. Your
attendance at the Aetna special meeting alone will not revoke any proxy previously given.

By Participants in the Aetna 401(k) Plan

Participants in the Aetna 401(k) Plan who receive this joint proxy statement/prospectus in their capacity as participants in the Aetna 401(k) Plan
will receive voting instruction cards instead of proxy cards. The voting instruction card directs the trustee of the Aetna 401(k) Plan to vote the Aetna
common shares shown on the card as indicated on the card. Aetna common shares held through the Aetna 401(k) Plan may be voted by using the
Internet, by calling a toll-free telephone number or by marking, signing and dating the voting instruction card and mailing it to the trustee of the Aetna
401(k) Plan in accordance with the trustee’s instructions. Internet and telephone voting of shares held through the Aetna 401(k) Plan will be available
until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 8, 2018. Aetna common shares held through the Aetna 401(k) Plan for which no instructions are received will be
voted by the trustee of the Aetna 401(k) Plan in the same percentage as the Aetna common shares held through the 401(k) Plan for which the trustee
receives voting instructions unless contrary to ERISA. You may not vote the Aetna common shares you hold through the Aetna 401(k) Plan at the Aetna
special meeting.

Generally

If you hold Aetna common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must obtain a written legal
proxy from that institution and present it to the judge of election with your ballot to be able to vote in person at the Aetna special meeting. To request a
legal proxy, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record.

If your Aetna common shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must instruct
the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will vote your
shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee holder
of record with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record who hold Aetna common shares in “street
name” typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions on how to vote from the
beneficial owner. However, brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record typically are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters
that are “non-routine” without specific instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, each of the three
proposals to be considered at the Aetna special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are considered non-routine. Therefore
brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the three proposals to be considered at the
Aetna special meeting.

Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that are present in person or represented by proxy at the
Aetna special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such
shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record does not have discretionary voting power on such
proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals to
be considered at the Aetna special meeting as described in this

joint proxy statement/prospectus, if a beneficial owner of Aetna common shares held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the Aetna special meeting. As a result,
there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of the three proposals to be considered at the Aetna special meeting as described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

A beneficial owner’s failure to instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record how to vote Aetna common shares held in “street
name” will therefore have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. A beneficial owner’s failure to
instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record how to vote Aetna common shares held in “street name” will have no effect on the proposal
to approve the Aetna adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

All shares represented by each properly completed and valid proxy received before or at the Aetna special meeting will be voted in accordance
with the instructions given in the proxy. If an Aetna shareholder signs a proxy card and returns it without giving instructions for voting on any proposal,
the Aetna common shares represented by that proxy card will be voted “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the
Aetna adjournment proposal and “FOR” the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend the Aetna special meeting
in person, please vote or otherwise submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted
at the Aetna special meeting. If your Aetna common shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee holder of record, please
follow the instructions on the voting instruction form furnished to you by such record holder.

Revocability of Proxies; Changing Your Vote

You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before the closing of the polls at the Aetna special meeting. If you are an Aetna
shareholder of record at the record date (the close of business on February 5, 2018), you can revoke your proxy or change your vote by:
 

 
•  sending a signed notice stating that you revoke your proxy to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by mail at 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood,

NY 11717 or by fax at (631) 254-7733 that bears a date later than the date of the proxy you want to revoke and is received prior to the Aetna
special meeting;

 

 
•  submitting a valid, later-dated proxy via the Internet or telephone before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 12, 2018, or by mail that is

received prior to the Aetna special meeting; or
 

 
•  attending the Aetna special meeting (or, if the Aetna special meeting is adjourned or postponed, attending the adjourned or postponed

meeting) and voting in person, which automatically will cancel any proxy previously given, or revoking your proxy in person, but your
attendance at the Aetna special meeting alone will not revoke any proxy previously given.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must contact your broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record to change your vote or obtain a written legal proxy to vote your shares if you wish to cast your vote in person at the Aetna
special meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies; Expenses of Solicitation

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to holders of Aetna common shares in connection with the solicitation of proxies by
Aetna’s board of directors to be voted at the Aetna special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. Aetna will bear all costs and
expenses in connection with the solicitation of proxies, including the costs of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the

special meeting. Aetna has engaged Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Aetna special meeting and will pay Georgeson LLC a
fee of approximately $35,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of Aetna or its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from shareholders by
telephone, telegram, email, personal interview or other means. Aetna currently expects not to incur any costs beyond those customarily expended for a
solicitation of proxies in connection with the approval and adoption of a merger agreement. Directors, officers and employees of Aetna will not receive
additional compensation for their solicitation activities, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
with the solicitation. Brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies, fiduciaries, custodians and other nominees have been requested to forward
proxy solicitation materials to their customers, and such nominees will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Householding

The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of annual reports and proxy statements. It permits Aetna, with your permission, to send a
single notice of meeting and, to the extent requested, a single copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any household at which two or more
shareholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. This rule is called “householding,” and its purpose is to help reduce printing and
mailing costs of proxy materials. In 2016, Aetna began householding for registered shareholders. If you are a registered shareholder, please check the
appropriate box on your proxy card or select the householding option when you vote by Internet or phone if you would like to participate in Aetna’s
householding program. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards, and householding will not affect the
mailing of account statements or special notices in any way.

A number of brokerage firms have instituted householding for shares held in “street name.” If you and members of your household have multiple
accounts holding Aetna common shares, you may have received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you
have questions, require additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or wish to revoke your decision to household. These options are
available to you at any time.

Adjournment

Aetna shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give Aetna’s board of directors authority to adjourn the Aetna special meeting

AETNA PROPOSAL I: APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
CVS HEALTH PROPOSAL I: APPROVAL OF THE STOCK ISSUANCE

General

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to holders of Aetna common shares in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
board of directors of Aetna to be voted at the Aetna special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the Aetna special meeting. At the
Aetna special meeting, Aetna will ask its shareholders to vote on (i) a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (ii) the Aetna adjournment
proposal and (iii) the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to holders of shares of CVS Health common stock in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the board of directors of CVS Health to be voted at the CVS Health special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the CVS
Health special meeting. At the CVS Health special meeting, CVS Health will ask its stockholders to vote on (i) a proposal to approve the stock issuance
and (ii) the CVS Health adjournment proposal.

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Aetna, with Aetna continuing as the surviving corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health. The merger will not be completed and the merger consideration will not be paid unless Aetna
shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and CVS Health stockholders approve the stock issuance. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety because it is the
legal document that governs the merger. For additional information about the merger, see “The Merger Agreement—Structure of the Merger” and “The
Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration” beginning on pages 177 and 178, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Upon completion of the merger, each Aetna common share will be converted into the right to receive $145.00 in cash without interest thereon and
0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock. Based on the number of Aetna common shares (including the number of shares underlying Aetna stock
appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs, Aetna PSUs and unexercised rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan) outstanding as of February 5,
2018, CVS Health expects to issue approximately 280 million shares of CVS Health common stock to Aetna shareholders and Aetna equity award
holders pursuant to the merger. The actual number of shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger will be determined at
completion of the merger based on the exchange ratio of 0.8378 and the number of Aetna common shares (including the number of shares underlying
Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs, Aetna PSUs and unexercised rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan) outstanding at such
time. Based on the number of Aetna common shares (including the number of shares underlying Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs, Aetna
PSUs and unexercised rights under the Aetna employee stock purchase plan) outstanding as of February 5, 2018, and the number of shares of CVS
Health common stock outstanding as of February 5, 2018, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the merger, former Aetna shareholders
will own approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of CVS Health common stock.

Background of the Merger

As part of the ongoing review of their respective companies’ businesses, the boards of directors and management of each of CVS Health and
Aetna regularly evaluate their respective companies’ historical performance, future growth prospects and overall strategic objectives and consider
potential opportunities to enhance stockholder value. For each company, these reviews have included consideration of various potential strategic
alternatives, including potential strategic partnerships, joint ventures and business combination transactions, including, in Aetna’s case, its proposed
acquisition of Humana Inc., which is referred to in this joint proxy/statement prospectus as Humana, announced in July 2015 and terminated in February
2017, and the potential benefits and risks of such transactions in light of, among other things, industry developments in the health care and retail
industries, as applicable, and such company’s competitive position in its respective industries.

In addition, since 2010, Aetna and CVS Health have been party to a long-term agreement pursuant to which CVS Health provides certain
pharmacy benefit management services to Aetna and certain of its customers and members, as more fully described below in the section “—Certain
Relationships between CVS Health and Aetna” beginning on page 100 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Throughout the term of this agreement,
members of senior management of each of Aetna and CVS Health, including, from time to time, Mark T. Bertolini, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Aetna, and Larry J. Merlo, President and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Health, regularly discussed the companies’ relationship under their

Health and two other retail and health care industry participants, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Party X and Party Y,
regarding potential strategic partnerships, joint ventures and other opportunities. Discussions with Party Y led to a pilot program beginning in this
timeframe with respect to Aetna members visiting Party Y’s retail health-service clinics in a particular state. Members of the management of Aetna and
Party Y also discussed data analytics and a potential co-branded Medicare product.

On May 19, 2017, the Aetna board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting at which, among other things, the board of directors received

On June 7, 2017, after negotiation of the terms thereof, with, in Aetna’s case, the assistance of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, which is referred to in

On October 10, 2017, the CVS Health board of directors held a telephonic special meeting that was attended by members of CVS Health’s senior
management. At the meeting, Mr. Merlo provided the board of directors with an update on management’s discussions with Aetna and Mr. Denton
presented certain preliminary financial analyses related to Aetna and an analysis of precedent transactions in the health care industry. Mr. Denton also
informed the board of directors that CVS Health planned to engage Goldman Sachs as an additional financial advisor in connection with the potential
acquisition of Aetna. Also at the meeting, Mr. Moriarty informed the board of directors that Shearman & Sterling LLP, which is referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Shearman, had been retained as outside legal counsel to CVS Health in connection with the potential acquisition of
Aetna. Mr. Moriarty then reviewed with the board of directors their fiduciary duties in connection with a potential acquisition of Aetna, as well as a
preliminary antitrust and regulatory analysis and an overview of the regulatory approval process. Mr. Denton then reviewed with the board of directors
potential terms of the proposed transaction, including the per share acquisition price and allocation of cash and shares of CVS Health common stock to
be paid in the proposed transaction. Following further discussion of these matters, the board of directors authorized management to extend to Aetna a
nonbinding written proposal for the acquisition of Aetna and to enter into negotiations with Aetna regarding such acquisition proposal.

On October 11, 2017, Mr. Bertolini received a letter from Mr. Merlo containing a non-binding indication of interest from CVS Health to acquire
all of the outstanding Aetna common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $195.00 per share consisting of approximately 55% in cash and 45% in
shares of CVS Health common stock. The letter indicated that CVS Health would be open to discussing representation for Aetna’s directors on the board
of directors of the combined company consistent with comparable precedent transactions, and that CVS Health expected there to be a significant
opportunity for Aetna management to be part of the combined company, given Aetna’s industry expertise. Aetna’s management arranged for CVS
Health’s letter to be distributed to the Aetna board of directors on October 12, 2017.

On October 13, 2017, Mr. Bertolini and the chief executive officer of Party X had a telephonic conversation in which the chief executive officer of

letter. The board of directors reviewed with management its prior discussions regarding potential industry consolidation and potential risks and merits of
partnering with a company with a large retail footprint, including the potential for improving the health of Aetna’s members, generating meaningful
medical cost savings and making Aetna’s products more competitive. Representatives of Davis Polk advised the board of directors regarding its
fiduciary duties in the context of exploring potential business combination transactions and CVS Health’s non-binding indication of interest. After
discussion, with input from management and Aetna’s advisors, the Aetna board of directors directed management to obtain from CVS Health additional
information regarding CVS Health’s proposed operating model for the combined company and regarding regulatory considerations so that the board of
directors could better understand and evaluate CVS Health’s proposal. The board of directors directed Aetna management to review these matters with
the board of directors at its next regularly scheduled meeting on October 27, 2017, and also to review Aetna’s stand-alone plan with the board of
directors at that meeting. Consistent with its past practice (including on the Humana transaction), the board of directors determined to engage lawyers
affiliated with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, which is referred to in this joint

proxy statement/prospectus as Simpson Thacher, as outside legal counsel to the non-management members of the board of directors in connection with
CVS Health’s proposal.

On October 17, 2017, Mr. Bertolini had a telephonic conversation with Mr. Merlo to inform him regarding the meeting of the Aetna board of
directors and the board of directors’ request for additional information on the proposed operating model for the combined company and regulatory
considerations relating to the proposed transaction. Mr. Guertin had a telephonic conversation with Mr. Denton regarding the same subjects.

On October 18, 2017, Aetna and Party Y entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement. This non-disclosure agreement does not restrict Party Y
from making a proposal to Aetna regarding a potential business combination transaction with Aetna.

On October 20, 2017, Mr. Moriarty and a representative of Dechert LLP, outside antitrust counsel to CVS Health, which is referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Dechert, met with Thomas J. Sabatino, Jr., Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Aetna, and representatives of
Davis Polk to discuss regulatory approvals that would be required for the proposed transaction.

On October 24, 2017, Mr. Guertin had a telephonic conversation with Mr. Denton regarding CVS Health’s indication of interest and potential next
steps.

During trading hours on October 26, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that there had been discussions between Aetna and CVS Health
regarding a potential acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health.

On October 27, 2017, the Aetna board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting, which was attended by Aetna’s senior management,
representatives of Lazard, Allen & Company and Davis Polk and a representative of Simpson Thacher and Charles I. Cogut, a retired partner of Simpson
Thacher, acting in his individual capacity (the representative of Simpson Thacher and Mr. Cogut being referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus collectively as representatives of Simpson Thacher). The board of directors discussed (without Mr. Bertolini or other members of
Aetna’s management, Lazard, Allen & Company or Davis Polk present) CVS Health’s indication of interest and the terms of its proposal, and
representatives of Simpson Thacher advised the board of directors regarding its fiduciary duties in the context of exploring potential business
combination transactions. Members of Aetna’s management, Lazard, Allen & Company and Davis Polk then joined the meeting, and the board of
directors discussed a potential combination with CVS Health versus other potential partners and other strategic alternatives, including remaining a stand-
alone company, and the potential transactions under discussion with Party X and Party Y, as well as the unlikelihood that either Party X or Party Y
would be interested in a potential business combination transaction with Aetna at such time. The board of directors reviewed with management how the
proposed transaction with CVS Health would be consistent with Aetna’s strategy of building local, community-based health care access points and that,
based on preliminary conversations with CVS Health, it appeared that a retail-enabled strategy could drive meaningful synergies for the combined
company. The board of directors reviewed with management materials provided by CVS Health regarding the combined company, and reviewed
financial forecasts prepared by Aetna management that reflected developments in the business since the board of directors’ review of Aetna’s strategic
plan at its July 20, 2017 meeting. Representatives of Lazard and Allen & Company discussed with the board of directors Lazard’s and Allen &
Company’s respective preliminary financial analyses regarding each of Aetna and CVS Health on a stand-alone basis based on information provided by
Aetna’s management and publicly available information and the evolving health care landscape, including the growth of new business models in the
health care sector. Representatives of Davis Polk provided the board of directors with their antitrust analysis for the potential transaction.
Representatives of Davis Polk also summarized for the board of directors information provided by Lazard and Allen & Company regarding their
respective material relationships with CVS Health, Party X and Party Y. After discussion, the board of directors directed Aetna’s management to
conduct a due diligence review of CVS Health, including with respect to certain litigation and regulatory matters, in order to evaluate whether to pursue
the proposed transaction, and determined to hold another meeting to continue its discussion of the

proposed transaction following completion of that review. The board of directors also determined to engage a separate financial advisor for the sole
purpose of advising the non-management members of the board of directors in connection with the proposed transaction, and Aetna subsequently
engaged Evercore Group L.L.C., which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Evercore, in such capacity, after Aetna’s lead director
received from Simpson Thacher a summary of information provided by Evercore regarding its material relationships with CVS Health, Party X and
Party Y.

On October 29, 2017, at the requests of the respective managements of Aetna and CVS Health, representatives of Lazard and Allen & Company
had a telephonic conversation with representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs during which they discussed the nature of the business and financial
information needed by each party and its advisors in connection with a proposed transaction. Aetna’s financial advisors, consistent with Aetna’s
instructions, communicated that Aetna was not yet authorized to negotiate transaction terms and instead was focused on completing its due diligence
review of CVS Health so that Aetna and its board of directors could better understand and evaluate the proposed transaction.

During the weeks of October 30, 2017 and November 6, 2017, members of management of Aetna and CVS Health met for due diligence
meetings, during which their respective advisors were present. During this period, in furtherance of CVS Health’s due diligence review of Aetna as well
as Aetna’s due diligence review of CVS Health, the two parties held numerous in-person and telephonic due diligence sessions attended by employees
from each company, covering a variety of financial, legal and operational matters. During this timeframe, each of Aetna and CVS Health also made
available to the other party and its advisors an electronic dataroom containing certain non-public financial, legal and other information of such party.

On November 1, 2017, Shearman delivered an initial draft merger agreement for the proposed transaction to Davis Polk.

representatives of Lazard, Allen & Company and Evercore had in-person and telephonic discussions with representatives of Barclays and Goldman
Sachs regarding a number of topics relating to the proposed transaction and the financial information that Aetna and CVS Health had exchanged.

On November 7 and 8, 2017, the CVS Health board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting that was attended by members of CVS
Health’s senior management and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs. At the meeting, the board of directors received an update from
management on its discussions with Aetna and the due diligence review of Aetna. Representatives of each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs reviewed
with the board of directors their respective preliminary financial analyses of the proposed transaction, including the financial impact of differing levels
of cash and stock in the proposed consideration. The board of directors further reviewed and discussed with management the strategic rationale for the
proposed transaction and its expected value creation opportunities as well as certain terms of the proposed transaction. Although no specific negotiations
of price had yet occurred with Aetna’s representatives, CVS Health’s management discussed with the board of directors an increase in the cash
component of the consideration to provide greater certainty to Aetna and its shareholders of the ultimate value of the consideration.

On November 10, 2017, members of management of each of Aetna and Party Y met to discuss a potential strategic partnership or joint venture
between the parties regarding retail health services.

On November 11, 2017, representatives of Aetna and CVS Health and their respective advisors met for a diligence presentation by Aetna
management. At this meeting, Mr. Denton conveyed CVS Health’s revised proposal to increase the cash component of the proposed purchase price to
approximately 70%, with the remaining 30% to be paid in shares of CVS Health common stock.

On November 14, 2017, the Aetna board of directors held a special meeting, which was attended by representatives of Evercore and Simpson
Thacher. At the meeting, the board of directors continued its discussion (without Mr. Bertolini or representatives of Evercore present) of CVS Health’s
indication of interest and the terms of its proposal, including in the context of Aetna’s stand-alone strategic plan. Representatives of Simpson Thacher

joined the meeting and provided the board of directors with an update on the process and status of Aetna’s due diligence review of CVS Health.
Mr. Bertolini briefed the board of directors on CVS Health’s revised proposal, including the increase in the cash component of the proposed purchase
price to approximately 70%, with the remaining 30% to be paid in shares of CVS Health common stock. Mr. Bertolini discussed with the board of
directors Aetna’s stand-alone strategic plan as well as management’s views on the potential operating model and potential synergies of the combined
company. The board of directors discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Aetna exploring strategic alternatives with CVS Health or other
companies with retail pharmacy operations as opposed to continuing to operate as a stand-alone company. Representatives of Evercore discussed with
the board of directors their views on certain potential longer term risks that could affect the combined company. After discussion, the board of directors
directed management to prepare a more detailed analysis of strategic alternatives potentially available to Aetna on a stand-alone basis, including
alternatives involving acquisitions and building Aetna’s own clinics. The board of directors also directed management to continue Aetna’s due diligence
review of CVS Health. Management was authorized by the board of directors to commence negotiations on the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement, and to indicate to CVS Health and its advisors that CVS Health’s proposed purchase price would need to be increased meaningfully. The
board of directors determined to hold another meeting to continue its discussion of the proposed transaction and Aetna’s stand-alone strategic plan.

On November 15, 2017, at the requests of the respective managements of Aetna and CVS Health, representatives of Lazard and Allen & Company
had a telephonic conversation with representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs. During that call, consistent with Aetna’s instructions,
representatives of Lazard and Allen & Company communicated that CVS Health needed to increase its proposed purchase price meaningfully and that
Aetna was focused on certainty of closing as well as the potential operating model of the combined company. CVS Health’s financial advisors requested
a specific proposal on price, which Aetna’s financial advisors declined to provide.

On November 17, 2017, Davis Polk delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to Shearman. Between November 17, 2017 and the

collaborating with one or more national retailers to develop clinics and acquiring a retail pharmacy operator, and the potential benefits, risks and
challenges of each alternative. Representatives of Lazard and Allen & Company then discussed with the board of directors Lazard’s and Allen &
Company’s respective preliminary financial analyses regarding the proposed transaction with CVS Health and the financial advisors also discussed
potential strategic alternatives identified by Aetna’s management for Aetna as a stand-alone company. Representatives of Evercore then discussed with
the board of directors their preliminary analyses regarding these strategic alternatives, including the relative value creation opportunity for each
alternative and the proposed transaction with CVS Health. The board of directors also discussed with management potential synergies in a combination
of Aetna and CVS Health. The board of directors discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Aetna exploring a business combination with CVS
Health as opposed to continuing to operate as a stand-alone company. The board of directors directed management to continue Aetna’s due diligence
review of CVS Health and negotiation of the merger agreement, and determined to continue its discussions at the next regularly scheduled board of
directors meeting to be held on December 1, 2017.

other things, summaries of the legal, financial and operational due diligence review of Aetna, the efforts to arrange the bridge financing for the proposed
transaction, including feedback from ratings agencies, the antitrust and regulatory analysis and approval process, and the merger agreement and
principal provisions still being negotiated therein. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the board of directors their
respective preliminary financial analyses of the proposed transaction. Members of CVS Health’s management then reviewed and discussed with the
board of directors a proposal, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as CVS Health’s revised proposal, to (i) increase the
consideration to be offered to Aetna shareholders to $203.00 per Aetna common share, which would be paid approximately 70% in cash and 30% in
shares of CVS Health common stock, with the stock portion of the consideration to be based on a fixed exchange ratio to be agreed before signing of the
merger agreement, (ii) a termination fee of $1.7 billion payable by CVS Health in the event the transaction does not close because of the failure to obtain
required regulatory approvals (which termination fee is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the regulatory termination fee) and (iii) the
addition of two Aetna directors, including Mr. Bertolini, to the CVS Health board of directors upon the closing of the transaction.

Also on November 28, 2017, representatives of Aetna management and Davis Polk met with representatives of CVS Health and Shearman to
discuss and negotiate the remaining open terms of the merger agreement for the proposed transaction. During the course of these negotiations,
representatives of Aetna proposed a regulatory termination fee of $2.5 billion.

On November 29, 2017, Mr. Denton met with Mr. Guertin, and Mr. Guertin made a revised proposal, which included (i) a purchase price of
$207.00 per Aetna common share, which would be paid approximately 70% in cash and 30% in shares of CVS Health common stock, with the stock

direction of CVS Health management, a representative of Barclays advised a representative of Lazard that CVS Health’s proposed purchase price of
$207.00 per Aetna common share consisted of $145.00 in cash and $62.00 in shares of CVS Health common stock.

On November 30, 2017, at the requests of the respective managements of Aetna and CVS Health, representatives of Lazard, Allen & Company
and Evercore had a series of telephonic conversations with representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs regarding the price per share of CVS Health
common stock on which CVS Health’s most recent proposal was based and the resulting exchange ratio for the stock portion of the purchase price. Also
on November 30, 2017, Mr. Guertin and Mr. Denton had several telephonic conversations to discuss the exchange ratio, which was ultimately agreed,
subject to the approval of Aetna’s and CVS Health’s respective boards of directors, to be 0.8378 shares of CVS Health common stock per Aetna
common share.

In the evening of November 30, 2017, the CVS Health board of directors held a telephonic special meeting that was attended by members of CVS

America, N.A. Mr. Moriarty and representatives of Shearman then summarized for the board of directors information provided by Barclays and
Goldman Sachs regarding their (and their respective affiliates’) respective material relationships with CVS Health and Aetna. The board of directors also
instructed CVS Health’s management to engage a third independent financial advisor to CVS Health to evaluate the fairness to CVS Health of the
consideration to be paid in the merger. Mr. Moriarty then reviewed and discussed with the board of directors a summary of the results of the parties’
negotiations with respect to the merger agreement as well as the remaining outstanding issues being negotiated, including with respect to employee
compensation and benefits matters. Mr. Moriarty then provided an updated review of the required regulatory approvals and related approval process.
Finally, representatives of each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs reviewed with the board of directors their respective preliminary financial analyses of
the proposed transaction.

Also in the evening of November 30, 2017, the Aetna board of directors held a special meeting, which was attended by representatives of

including Mr. Bertolini, to the CVS Health board of directors upon the closing of the transaction. Representatives of Simpson Thacher advised the board
of directors regarding its fiduciary duties in the context of exploring potential business combination transactions. Representatives of Evercore discussed
with the board of directors their updated views on certain potential longer term risks that could affect the combined company. During the discussions of
the board of directors at this meeting, Mr. Bertolini expressed his view that the proposed transaction with CVS Health was in the best interests of Aetna
and its shareholders.

On December 1, 2017, CVS Health’s management retained Centerview as an additional financial advisor to CVS Health to evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to CVS Health of the consideration to be paid in the merger.

On December 1, 2017, the Aetna board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting, which was attended by Aetna’s senior management and
representatives of Lazard, Allen & Company, Davis Polk, Evercore and Simpson Thacher. The board of directors discussed (without Mr. Bertolini or
other members of Aetna’s management, Lazard, Allen & Company, Davis Polk, Evercore or Simpson Thacher present) certain aspects of the proposed
transaction with CVS Health and other matters. Aetna’s management and representatives of Davis Polk and Simpson Thacher then joined the meeting,
and the board of directors, management and their legal advisors discussed the key terms of the proposed transaction, including price and mix of
consideration, the strategic and financial rationale of the proposed transaction, including synergy opportunities, the merits and considerations of
potential strategic alternatives, including Aetna remaining a stand-alone company, and the impact of potential industry consolidation. Aetna
management then reviewed with the board of directors the operational, financial and legal due diligence review of CVS Health conducted by Aetna,
including with respect to certain litigation and regulatory matters. Representatives of Davis Polk provided the board of directors with a summary of the
key terms of the merger agreement and updated their antitrust analysis for the potential transaction. The board of directors also reviewed certain

Health’s senior management and representatives of Shearman reviewed and discussed with the board of directors the key terms of the merger agreement
and the changes to such terms since the board of directors’ November 30, 2017 meeting. Next, members of management discussed with the board of
directors CVS Health’s and Aetna’s limited contacts in the prior two years with Centerview, none of which had involved the payment of any fees to
Centerview, following which the board of directors approved the engagement by CVS Health of Centerview as an additional financial advisor in
connection with the proposed transaction. Representatives of Centerview then reviewed with the board of directors Centerview’s financial analysis of
the proposed transaction and rendered to the board of directors an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion

discussion, including consideration of the factors described in the section “—CVS Health’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the CVS
Health Board of Directors that CVS Health Stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance” beginning on page 107 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus at

discussion, including consideration of the factors described in the section “—Aetna’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Aetna Board of
Directors that Aetna Shareholders Approve and Adopt the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 101 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus at this
and prior meetings, the Aetna board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger

Aetna’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Aetna Board of Directors that Aetna Shareholders Approve and Adopt the Merger
Agreement

In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, Aetna’s board of directors consulted with Aetna’s management and legal and financial
advisors and, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the
merger) and to recommend that Aetna’s shareholders vote “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement (including the merger), Aetna’s
board of directors considered a variety of factors, including the following (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance):

Strategic Factors

Aetna believes that joining CVS Health and Aetna will improve the consumer health care experience by combining Aetna’s health care benefits
and services with CVS Health’s 9,700 retail locations, 1,100 clinics and integrated pharmacy capabilities with the goal of becoming the new, trusted
front door to health care in the U.S. The combination of Aetna’s businesses with CVS Health’s existing businesses is expected to result in a number of
potential strategic benefits, including:
 

 

•  Enhanced consumer engagement. With nearly 70% of the U.S. population living within three miles of a CVS Health retail store, Aetna
believes that its presence in CVS Health’s retail locations will provide an opportunity to better understand Aetna’s members’ health goals,
guide them through the health care system and help them achieve their best health, and will provide a seamless connection for patients to
their providers, to improve continuity of care. Aetna also believes its presence in retail locations will allow it to develop trusted relationships
with consumers in their local communities, helping the combined company retain and grow membership, and, by doing so, enabling the
combined company to improve patients’ access to convenient care, facilitating preemptive care, medication adherence, and early
intervention.

 

 

•  Lower cost, higher quality care. Aetna believes that the combined company will be able to deliver care at lower cost to consumers and
customers through CVS Health’s in-store clinics, which are currently significantly less expensive than traditional health care delivery
settings. In addition, Aetna believes the combined company will have the ability to complement the in-store clinics and traditional health
care delivery systems through interventions when consumers, members and patients are not in the traditional delivery system, which will
enhance access to care. The combination is also expected to align CVS Health’s clinics and in-home services with Aetna’s provider
networks and care management expertise, which Aetna believes will allow the combined company to better address the social determinants
that drive health care costs.

 

 

•  Integrated medical and pharmacy solutions. The integration of CVS Health’s pharmacy and pharmacy benefit management services and
Aetna’s clinical data, analytics and care management capabilities is expected to improve medication adherence and care plan compliance
while uncovering new ways to impact Aetna’s members’ health. Aetna believes the combined solutions of CVS Health and Aetna can help
offset the rising cost of prescription drugs.

 

 
•  Medicare leadership. The combination of Aetna’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement assets with CVS Health’s Medicare Part

D excellence is expected to drive higher quality, lower costs and a better, more convenient experience for seniors.
 

 
•  Innovative Plan Designs. By combining CVS Health’s care delivery capabilities with Aetna’s traditional strengths in care management,

Aetna believes that the combined company will be able to offer innovative plan designs, which will make it easier and cheaper for Aetna’s
members and plan sponsors to navigate the health care system.

 

 
•  Enhanced mobile capabilities. Combining Aetna’s clinical data and digital assets with CVS Health’s pharmacy data and mobile tools is

expected to allow consumers to schedule appointments, manage medications, access their personal health data and communicate with health
care professionals more

 conveniently and efficiently, which Aetna believes will improve health outcomes, including by helping consumers adhere to their care plans.
 

 

•  Increased operating efficiency. The merger is expected to create significant opportunities to increase the combined company’s operating
efficiency by simplifying processes and projected administrative and other cost synergies, which Aetna believes could be $2.4 billion per
year by the fifth full year following completion of the merger, and which Aetna believes will further drive efficiencies and cost savings for
consumers and customers.

 

 

•  Leadership and governance. CVS Health has stated that it plans for members of the Aetna management team to play significant roles in the
combined company and for Aetna to operate as a stand-alone business unit within the combined company led by members of Aetna’s current
management team, and CVS Health has committed to maintain in accordance with the merger agreement the Aetna brand in the
marketplace. Aetna believes these commitments will in each case help to build on Aetna’s distinguished history and position the combined
company for growth.

 

 
•  Medicaid. By utilizing CVS Health’s pharmacy footprint and in-store clinics, Aetna believes that the combined company will be able to

better serve the Medicaid population by improving their access to care at lower cost.

Other Factors

In addition to the strategic factors summarized above, Aetna’s board of directors also considered the following factors in connection with its
evaluation of the merger:
 

 
•  the respective businesses, operations, management, financial condition, earnings, market reputation, competitive pressures, regulatory

constraints and prospects of Aetna and CVS Health;
 

 
•  the results of Aetna’s due diligence investigation of CVS Health and the reputation, business practices and experience of CVS Health and its

management;
 

 •  the historical trading prices of shares of CVS Health common stock and Aetna common shares;
 

 
•  the review by Aetna’s board of directors with the assistance of Aetna’s management and legal and financial advisors of the structure of the

merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement;
 

 
•  trends and competitive developments in the retail and health care industries (including the pharmacy industry), including potential new

entrants into such industries;
 

 
•  the fact that CVS Health has obtained an executed debt commitment letter which provides for a bridge loan facility, the limited number and

nature of the conditions to the debt financing and CVS Health’s obligation under the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the debt financing at completion of the merger;

 

 
•  the fact that Aetna’s board of directors was unanimous in its determination to recommend the merger agreement for approval and adoption

by Aetna’s shareholders;
 

 
•  the risks and uncertainties regarding then-pending tax reform proposals in the United States, including the potential costs to each of Aetna

and CVS Health, the potential benefits to Aetna on a stand-alone basis and the likelihood of any benefits being retained by Aetna in light of
the competitive industries in which Aetna operates;

 

 •  the fact that the merger agreement will be subject to the approval of Aetna’s shareholders;

Price and Structure
 

 
•  the current and historical market prices for Aetna common shares, including the fact that the implied value of the merger consideration of

$207.94 per share (as of December 1, 2017) represented an approximate premium of (i) 15% over the closing price per share of Aetna
common shares on

December 1, 2017 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger agreement), (ii) 30% over the closing price per share of
Aetna common shares on October 25, 2017 (the last trading day prior to reports in the news media of rumors of a transaction involving
Aetna), (iii) 32% over the volume-weighted average closing price per share of Aetna common shares over the 30 days ended October 25,
2017 and (iv) 62% over the closing price per share of Aetna common shares on February 15, 2017 (the trading day following the
termination of Aetna’s agreement to acquire Humana);

 

 
•  the fact that, because holders of outstanding Aetna common shares as of immediately prior to completion of the merger are expected to hold

approximately 22% of the outstanding CVS Health common stock immediately after completion of the merger, Aetna shareholders are
expected to have the opportunity to participate in the future performance of the combined company, including synergies;

 

 
•  the fact that approximately 70% of the merger consideration is payable in cash, which provides Aetna’s shareholders with certainty of value

upon completion of the merger;
 

 
•  the fact that because the exchange ratio under the merger agreement is fixed (and will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the market price of

Aetna common shares or CVS Health common stock), Aetna shareholders have greater certainty as to the number of shares of CVS Health
common stock to be received in the merger;

 

 

•  the fact that Aetna’s board of directors had carefully considered, with the assistance of Aetna’s management and legal and financial advisors,
various potential strategic alternatives available to Aetna, including remaining an independent company or pursuing certain other alternative
transactions, and had explored the possibility of potential strategic transactions with other companies (including Party X and Party Y), and
the Aetna board of directors’ belief that the transaction with CVS Health presented a more favorable opportunity for Aetna’s shareholders
than the potential value that might result from other potential strategic alternatives available to Aetna;

 

 
•  the fact that Aetna’s board of directors had carefully considered, with the assistance of Aetna’s management and legal and financial advisors,

the potential consequences for Aetna if CVS Health were to pursue certain strategic alternatives to the proposed transaction with Aetna, and
the Aetna board of directors’ belief that Aetna’s strategic alternatives may be more limited and less favorable in such circumstances;

 

 
•  the fact that, notwithstanding the publicity surrounding a potential transaction between Aetna and CVS Health over more than a month prior

to December 3, 2017, Aetna had not received an acquisition proposal from any third party (other than CVS Health);
 

 
•  the view of Aetna’s board of directors, after review by the board of directors with the assistance of Aetna’s legal advisors of the potential

regulatory considerations of the transaction, that CVS Health will successfully consummate the merger in a timely manner;
 

 
•  the terms of the debt commitment letter and the bridge loan facility thereunder, particularly in light of the then-current market for such

commitments and facilities;
 

 
•  the fact that Aetna’s management was assisted in negotiations by Aetna’s legal and financial advisors and that Aetna’s board of directors was

provided directly and regularly with perspectives on the negotiations from Aetna’s management and advisors;
 

 

•  the separate opinions, each dated December 3, 2017, of Lazard and Allen & Company to Aetna’s board of directors as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of such date, of the consideration to be paid to holders of Aetna common shares in the merger, which opinions
were based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the
review undertaken, as more fully described in the section entitled “—Opinions of Aetna’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 111 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus;

Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement
 

 

•  the fact that CVS Health is required to take all actions necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction, including agreeing to
divestitures if necessary, unless such actions would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or on Aetna, as more fully described in the section entitled “Merger Agreement—
Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant” beginning on page 194 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;

 

 
•  the fact that, if the merger is not completed because CVS Health is unable to obtain certain regulatory approvals for the transaction,

termination fee of $2.1 billion;

 

 

•  the limited ability of CVS Health’s board of directors to change its recommendation that CVS Health’s stockholders approve the stock
issuance, and the fact that CVS Health will be required to pay Aetna a termination fee of $2.1 billion if (i) Aetna terminates the merger
agreement as a result of (a) an adverse change of CVS Health’s board of directors’ recommendation that CVS Health’s stockholders approve
the stock issuance or (b) CVS Health’s material breach of its “no shop” obligations or its obligation to call the CVS Health special meeting
to approve the stock issuance, (ii) CVS Health terminates the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an
acquisition of CVS Health that is superior to the merger or (iii) (a) either party terminates the merger agreement as a result of the failure of
CVS Health’s stockholders to approve the stock issuance, (b) a proposal for an acquisition of CVS Health was publicly announced and not
withdrawn prior to the CVS Health special meeting and (c) CVS Health enters into or completes an alternative transaction within one year
after such termination;

to lead to a proposal that is superior to the merger;

 

 

•  the fact that Aetna’s board of directors, subject to certain conditions, has the right to (i) change its recommendation of the transaction in
response to a proposal to acquire Aetna that is superior to the merger or an intervening event with respect to Aetna or (ii) terminate the
merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an acquisition of Aetna that is superior to the merger, in each case, if
Aetna’s board of directors determines that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to Aetna’s shareholders;

 

 
•  Aetna’s board of directors’ conclusion, after consultation with Aetna’s advisors, that the deal protection provisions of the merger agreement

•  the fact that the end date under the merger agreement of December 3, 2018 (which may be extended by either party to March 3, 2019 and by

Risks and Potentially Negative Factors

Aetna’s board of directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the following:
 

 
•  the fact that the exchange ratio with respect to the stock portion of the merger consideration is fixed, which could result in Aetna’s

shareholders being adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of CVS Health common stock;
 

 

•  the risk that the merger may not be completed despite the parties’ efforts or that completion of the merger may be delayed, even if the
requisite approvals are obtained from Aetna shareholders and CVS Health stockholders, including the possibility that conditions to the
parties’ obligations to complete the merger may not be satisfied, and the potential resulting disruptions to Aetna’s and CVS Health’s
respective businesses;

 

 
•  the fact that Aetna and CVS Health must obtain clearance under the HSR Act, as well as other approvals from state insurance and other

regulators, in order to complete the merger, which approvals may not be obtained or may be subject to conditions that CVS Health is not
required to comply with;

 

 

•  the challenges inherent in the combination of two companies, including the risk that integration of the two companies may take more time
and be more costly than anticipated, the risk that the cost savings, synergies and other benefits expected to be obtained as a result of the
merger might not be fully or timely realized, the risk that the combined company may not succeed in implementing a new retail health
operating model or that consumers may not embrace the new model, the risk of front store retail sales revenue pressures from competitors,
the risk of pharmacy revenue pressures from competitors, the risk of the loss of pharmacy benefit management revenues from other
managed care companies and the risk of price/earnings multiple compression;

 

 

•  the amount of time it could take to complete the regulatory approval process and the merger, the potential for diversion of management
focus for an extended period and employee attrition, the potential inability to hire new employees and the possible adverse effects of the
announcement and pendency of the transaction on customers, providers, vendors, regulators and other business relationships, and the
communities in which Aetna operates, in particular if the merger is not completed;

 

 
•  the restrictions under the terms of the merger agreement on the conduct of Aetna’s business prior to completion of the merger, which could

delay or prevent Aetna from undertaking material strategic opportunities that might arise pending completion of the merger to the detriment
of Aetna’s shareholders, in particular if the merger is not completed;

 

 •  the risk that the financial performance of Aetna and CVS Health might not meet the expectations of their respective managements;
 

 •  the limitations on Aetna’s ability to solicit alternative proposals for an acquisition of Aetna;
 

 
•  the fact that CVS Health does not have to complete the merger if CVS Health and Aetna would be required to take actions to obtain

regulatory approvals that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory material
adverse effect on CVS Health or on Aetna;

The above discussion of the material factors considered by Aetna’s board of directors in its consideration of the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement is not intended to be exhaustive, but does set forth the principal factors considered by Aetna’s board of directors.
In light of the number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with the evaluation of the merger, and the complexity of these matters,
Aetna’s board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights or values to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its final decision to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Aetna’s board of directors viewed its decision as based on all of the information available to it and the factors presented to and considered by it,
including its experience and history. In addition, individual directors may themselves have given different weight to different factors. The factors,
potential risks and uncertainties contained in this explanation of Aetna’s reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section contain
information that is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 72 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

CVS Health’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the CVS Health Board of Directors that CVS Health Stockholders Approve the
Stock Issuance

In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, CVS Health’s board of directors consulted with CVS Health’s management and legal and
financial advisors and, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the stock issuance, and to recommend that CVS Health’s stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the stock issuance, CVS Health’s board of directors
considered a variety of factors, including the following (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance):

Strategic Factors

CVS Health believes that the acquisition of Aetna will complement its competitive strategy, which is built on a diversified set of core and
emerging businesses that enable it to better compete with more cost-effective products, pursue profitable growth across a range of opportunities and lead
the transformation of the health care industry to a more consumer-focused marketplace. The acquisition of Aetna and the combination of Aetna’s
businesses with CVS Health’s businesses is expected to result in a number of strategic benefits, including:
 

 •  creating a leading health care platform with an unmatched suite of services;
 

 •  providing high-touch connectivity to consumers as their primary health care resource in the community;
 

 •  improving quality of care through enhanced data integration and predictive analytics;
 

 
•  lowering the cost of health care through an integrated model anchored by CVS Health’s lower cost health care delivery settings and Aetna’s

provider networks and care management expertise;
 

 
•  providing a higher quality, more convenient health care experience for seniors at a lower cost through the combined company’s Medicare

assets;
 

 •  producing highly diversified, strong and stable cash flows;
 

 
•  providing potential synergies of $750 million in the second full year following closing and the potential for long-term opportunities for

additional savings; and
 

 •  providing low- to mid-single digit accretion in the second full year following closing.

Other Factors

In addition to the strategic factors summarized above, CVS Health’s board of directors also considered the following factors in connection with its
evaluation of the merger:
 

 
•  the respective businesses, operations, management, financial condition, earnings, market reputation, competitive pressures, regulatory

constraints and prospects of CVS Health and Aetna;
 

 
•  the results of CVS Health’s due diligence investigation of Aetna and the reputation, business practices and experience of Aetna and its

management;
 

 •  the historical trading prices of shares of CVS Health common stock and Aetna common shares;
 

 
•  the review by CVS Health’s board of directors, in consultation with its legal, financial and other advisors, of the structure of the merger and

the financial and other terms of the merger agreement;
 

 •  trends and competitive developments in the industries in which CVS Health and Aetna operate;
 

 •  the fact that the stock issuance will be subject to the approval of CVS Health’s stockholders;
 

 
•  the range of other strategic alternatives available to CVS Health and CVS Health’s board of directors’ belief that the transaction with Aetna

presented a more favorable opportunity for CVS Health’s stockholders than the potential value that may result from other strategic
alternatives available to CVS Health;

•  the fact that CVS Health’s board of directors had carefully considered, after consulting with CVS Health’s management and financial, legal
and other advisors, the potential consequences for CVS Health if Aetna were to pursue certain strategic alternatives to the proposed
transaction with CVS Health, and the CVS Health board of directors’ belief that CVS Health’s strategic alternatives may be more limited
and less favorable in such circumstances;

Price and Structure
 

 
•  the fact that because the exchange ratio under the merger agreement is fixed (and will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the market price of

shares of CVS Health common stock or Aetna common shares), CVS Health has greater certainty as to the number of shares of CVS Health
common stock to be issued in the merger;

 

 

•  the respective financial analyses of Barclays and Goldman Sachs and the respective opinions of each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs,
rendered orally on December 3, 2017 and subsequently confirmed in writing, to the CVS Health board of directors that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations, factors and assumptions set forth in the respective opinions, the merger
consideration to be paid by CVS Health in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to CVS Health. See “—Opinions of CVS
Health’s Financial Advisors—Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and “—
Opinions of CVS Health’s Financial Advisors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on page 132 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus;

 

 

•  the analyses of Centerview and the opinion of Centerview rendered to the CVS Health board of directors on December 3, 2017, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 3, 2017, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in
preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by CVS Health in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to CVS Health. See “—Opinions of CVS Health’s Financial Advisors—Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC”
beginning on page 145 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;

Certain Other Factors
 

 

•  the belief of the CVS Health board of directors, following consultation with CVS Health’s management, and based in part upon the debt
financing commitments that CVS Health obtained, that CVS Health will have the necessary financing to pay the aggregate cash portion of
the merger consideration and that CVS Health, following the merger, will be able to repay, service or refinance any indebtedness that is
expected to form the interim or permanent financing for the merger and, with respect to such indebtedness, to comply with applicable
financial covenants, after its review and discussion of various factors, including (i) the terms of CVS Health’s current indebtedness, (ii) the
terms of Aetna’s current indebtedness and (iii) the expected terms of the proposed interim and permanent financing for the merger (including
covenants, fees and interest);

 

 
•  the belief of the CVS Health board of directors, following consultation with CVS Health’s management, that the financing commitments it

had obtained to finance the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration were on attractive terms for CVS Health;
 

 
•  the belief of the CVS Health board of directors that CVS Health would maintain its investment grade credit rating after incurring the interim

or permanent indebtedness necessary to finance the cash portion of the merger;
 

 •  the experience of CVS Health’s management in integrating acquired companies;
 

 •  the expectation that members of Aetna’s management team will play significant roles in the combined company;

•  the requirement under the merger agreement that (i) for a period of at least five years following completion of the merger, CVS Health
maintain “Aetna” as the primary brand for the insurance businesses of the combined company, (ii) for a period of at least three years

practice, including by maintaining its name and charitable mission, and (iii) at completion of the merger, the CVS Health board of directors
will include three members of the board of directors of Aetna, including Mark T. Bertolini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aetna;

 

 

•  the fact that, while CVS Health is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to complete the merger, CVS Health is not obligated to take any
actions or agree to any terms, conditions or limitations as a condition to, or in connection with, obtaining any regulatory approvals required
to complete the merger that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory material
adverse effect on CVS Health or Aetna;

 

 
•  CVS Health’s ability, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to provide information to and engage in discussions or

negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal;

response to a superior proposal or an intervening event other than a superior proposal, if CVS Health’s board of directors determines that

•  the ability of CVS Health’s board of directors, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive

agreement providing for a superior proposal;
 

 
•  the limited ability of Aetna’s board of directors to change its recommendation that Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger

agreement;
 

 
•  the fact that Aetna is required to pay CVS Health a termination fee of $2.1 billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain

CVS Health to June 3, 2019 under certain circumstances) allows for sufficient time to complete the merger.

CVS Health’s board of directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the
following:
 

 
•  the risk that the merger may not be completed or may be delayed despite the parties’ efforts, including the possibility that conditions to the

parties’ obligations to complete the merger may not be satisfied, and the potential resulting disruptions to CVS Health’s and Aetna’s
businesses;

 

 
•  the potential length of the regulatory approval process and the period of time during which CVS Health may be subject to certain restrictions

on the conduct of its businesses, which could prevent CVS Health from making certain acquisitions or divestitures or otherwise pursuing
certain business opportunities;

 

 
•  the possibility that governmental authorities might seek to require certain actions of CVS Health or Aetna or impose certain terms,

conditions or limitations on CVS Health’s or Aetna’s businesses in connection with granting approval of the merger or might otherwise seek
to prevent or delay the merger;

 

 
•  the fact that CVS Health is required to pay Aetna a termination fee of $2.1 billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain

circumstances (i) due to the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the merger or (ii) relating to an acquisition proposal for

CVS HEALTH STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE STOCK ISSUANCE.

Opinions of Aetna’s Financial Advisors

Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC

Aetna has engaged Lazard as a financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. In connection with this engagement, Aetna requested
that Lazard render an opinion to the Aetna board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Aetna common shares of
the consideration to be paid to such holders in the merger. On December 3, 2017, at a meeting of the Aetna board of directors held to evaluate the
merger, Lazard rendered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 3, 2017, to the Aetna board of directors
to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion, the consideration to be paid to holders of Aetna common shares in the merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated December 3, 2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
The description of Lazard’s opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Lazard’s
opinion. Lazard’s opinion was for the benefit of the Aetna board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the
merger and did not address any terms or other aspects (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s
opinion) of the merger. Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other transaction or business
strategy in which Aetna might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Aetna to engage in the merger. Lazard’s opinion is not
intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote or act with respect to the
merger or any matter relating thereto.

In connection with its opinion, Lazard:
 

 (i) reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated December 2, 2017, of the merger agreement;
 

 (ii) reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Aetna and CVS Health;
 

 
(iii) reviewed various financial forecasts and other data prepared by Aetna relating to the business of Aetna, financial forecasts and other data

prepared by CVS Health and as extrapolated per Aetna

relevant in evaluating the business of Aetna;

Health or concerning the solvency or fair value of Aetna or CVS Health, and Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. Lazard is
not an actuary and Lazard’s services did not include any actuarial determination or evaluation by Lazard or any attempt to evaluate actuarial
assumptions or allowances for losses, uncollectible accounts, claims or other matters and, accordingly, Lazard assumed, without independent analysis,
the appropriateness of, and expressed no view or opinion as to, reserves. At Aetna’s direction, for purposes of Lazard’s analysis, Lazard utilized the
projected synergies and other benefits anticipated to be realized from the merger that were prepared by Aetna. With respect to the financial forecasts
utilized in Lazard’s analyses, including those related to projected synergies and other benefits anticipated by the management of Aetna to be realized
from the merger, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Aetna, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of Aetna and CVS Health, respectively, and such synergies and other benefits. In
addition, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Aetna, that such financial forecasts and projected synergies and other benefits would be realized in the
amounts and at the times contemplated thereby. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions
on which they were based.

Further, Lazard’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. Lazard assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events
occurring after the date of its opinion. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which Aetna common shares or shares of CVS Health
common stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the merger. In connection with Lazard’s engagement, Lazard was not
authorized to, and it did not, solicit indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with Aetna.

In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Aetna, that the merger would be consummated on the terms described in the merger
agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions. Representatives of Aetna advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that
the merger agreement, when executed, would conform to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of
Aetna, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for

the merger would not have an adverse effect on Aetna, CVS Health or the merger. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other
consequences that might result from the merger, nor does Lazard’s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory, actuarial or accounting matters, including,
without limitation, the potential impact of U.S. health care and tax laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies on Aetna, CVS Health or
the merger, as to which Lazard understood that Aetna obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no
view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s opinion) of the merger,
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated
by, the merger. In addition, Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or
otherwise.

In connection with its opinion, Lazard performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The summary
of the analyses below and certain factors considered is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by Lazard. The
preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion and analyses are not readily
susceptible to summary description. Lazard arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a whole, and did not
draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis. Accordingly, Lazard believes that the analyses and factors
summarized below must be considered as a whole and in context. Lazard further believes that selecting portions of the analyses and factors or focusing
on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Lazard’s analyses and opinion.

In performing its financial analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business and economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aetna and CVS Health. No company, business or
transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Aetna, CVS Health or their respective businesses or the merger and an evaluation of these
analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed.
The estimates of the future performance of Aetna and CVS Health in or underlying Lazard’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by such analyses. These analyses were
prepared solely as part of Lazard’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to the Aetna
board of directors in connection with the delivery of Lazard’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a
company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the assumptions
and estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty and should not be taken as the views of Lazard regarding the actual values of Aetna or CVS Health.

Lazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the merger. The type and amount of
consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between Aetna and CVS Health, rather than by any financial advisor, and was
approved by the Aetna board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Aetna board of directors and the CVS
Health board of directors. Lazard’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Aetna board of directors in its evaluation of
the proposed merger and the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Aetna board of directors or
management with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the merger.

Financial Analyses

The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “—Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial analyses
provided by Lazard in connection with its opinion, dated December 3, 2017, to the Aetna board of directors. The summary set forth below is not a
comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the analyses in the
summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Lazard, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by
Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed
by Lazard. Future results may differ from those described and such differences may be material. For purposes of the financial analyses described
below in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the term (i) “implied per share merger consideration” means approximately $207.94 per
share, calculated as the (a) cash consideration of $145.00 per share and (b) implied value of the stock consideration of approximately $62.94 per share
based on a 0.8378x per share exchange ratio and an illustrative reference closing price for shares of CVS Health common stock of $75.12 per share as of
December 1, 2017, (ii) “EBITDA” means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding certain one-time
non-recurring items, as applicable, and (iii) “EPS” means earnings per share, excluding certain one-time, non-recurring or non-cash items, as applicable.
Financial data utilized for Aetna and CVS Health in the financial analyses described below, to the extent based on internal financial forecasts and
estimates of management, were based on financial forecasts and other data prepared by Aetna relating to the business of Aetna and financial forecasts
and other data prepared by CVS Health and as extrapolated per Aetna relating to the business of CVS Health, which are referred to for purposes of this
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Aetna forecasts and the CVS Health forecasts, respectively. Financial data of Aetna, when
utilizing Aetna’s closing share price on December 1, 2017, were pro forma for Aetna’s completed sale of its domestic group life insurance, group
disability insurance and absence management businesses based on internal data provided by the management of Aetna. Implied per share equity value
reference ranges of Aetna and CVS Health reflected in the summaries of the financial analyses described below were rounded to the nearest $1.

Aetna Financial Analyses

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis – Perpetuity Growth Rate Methodology. Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna by
calculating, based on the Aetna forecasts, the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2017) of the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
that Aetna was forecasted to generate during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. For purposes
of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Lazard calculated a range of estimated terminal values for Aetna by applying a
range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% to Aetna’s stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows during the fiscal year ending December 31,
2022 (assuming, for purposes of the terminal year, growth in risk-based capital contributions commensurate with premium revenue growth), which
range of perpetuity growth rates was selected based on Lazard’s professional judgment and taking into account, among other things, the Aetna forecasts
and trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and sectors in which Aetna operates. The cash flows and range of terminal values were
then discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2017) using a selected range of discount rates of 7.0% to 8.0% derived from a weighted average
cost of capital calculation. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Aetna, as compared to
the implied per share merger consideration:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis – Exit Multiple Methodology. Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna by calculating, based on
the Aetna forecasts, the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2017) of the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aetna was
forecasted to generate during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. For purposes of this analysis,
stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Lazard calculated a range of estimated terminal values for Aetna by applying to Aetna’s
estimated EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 a range of EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to 11.0x selected based on Lazard’s
professional judgment and taking into account, among other things, observed implied calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples for Aetna and the
Aetna selected companies (as defined below under the heading “—Selected Public Companies Analysis”) noting, in particular, the calendar year 2018
estimated EBITDA multiples derived for Anthem, Inc. and Cigna Corporation. The cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to
present value (as of December 31, 2017) using a selected range of discount rates of 7.0% to 8.0% derived from a weighted average cost of capital
calculation. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Aetna, as compared to the implied per
share merger consideration:

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Lazard reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of Aetna and the following four
selected large cap publicly traded managed care companies that, given business and financial characteristics, Lazard considered generally relevant for
purposes of analysis, which are referred to for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Aetna selected companies:
 

 •  Anthem, Inc.
 

 •  Cigna Corporation
 

 •  Humana Inc.
 

 •  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated

Lazard reviewed, among other information, closing stock prices as of, in the case of the Aetna selected companies, December 1, 2017 (the last
trading day prior to the date of the merger agreement) and, in the case of Aetna, December 1, 2017 and October 25, 2017 (the last trading day prior to
initial published reports regarding a potential acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health), as a multiple of calendar year 2018 estimated EPS. Lazard also
reviewed enterprise values, calculated as fully diluted equity values based on closing stock prices as of, in the case of the Aetna selected companies,
December 1, 2017 and, in the case of Aetna, December 1, 2017 and October 25, 2017, plus total debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests (as
applicable) and less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and unconsolidated investments (as applicable), as a multiple of calendar year 2018 estimated
EBITDA. Financial data of the Aetna selected companies were based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and
other publicly available information.

Lazard observed overall low to high calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples for the
Aetna selected companies based on closing stock prices on December 1, 2017 of 18.0x to 21.4x (with a mean and a median of 19.6x) and 10.2x to 12.7x
(with a mean and a median of 11.4x), respectively, noting, in particular, the calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples and calendar year 2018
estimated EBITDA multiples derived for Anthem, Inc. of 18.0x and 11.9x, respectively, and the calendar year 2018 estimated EPS and calendar year
2018 estimated EBITDA multiples derived for Cigna Corporation of 18.3x and 10.9x, respectively. Lazard also noted that, based on closing prices for
Aetna common shares on December 1, 2017 and October 25, 2017 utilizing publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates, the calendar year
2018 estimated EPS multiples observed for Aetna were 18.0x and 15.9x, respectively, and the calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed
for Aetna were 10.7x and 9.8x, respectively.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Using publicly available information, Lazard reviewed financial information relating to the following
seven selected transactions involving target managed care organizations that, given business and financial characteristics, Lazard considered generally
relevant for purposes of analysis, which are referred to for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Aetna selected
transactions:

Lazard reviewed, among other information, transaction values of the Aetna selected transactions, calculated as the enterprise values implied for
the target companies based on the consideration paid or payable in the Aetna selected transactions, as a multiple, to the extent publicly available, of the
target company’s latest 12 months EBITDA as of the applicable announcement date of such transaction. Financial data for the Aetna selected
transactions were based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and other publicly available information.

Lazard observed overall low to high latest 12 months EBITDA multiples for the Aetna selected transactions of 8.0x to 16.2x (with a mean of
11.7x and a median of 12.6x and 25th and 75th percentile multiples of 9.2x and 12.6x, respectively) noting, in particular, the latest 12 months EBITDA
multiples derived for the July 2015 Anthem, Inc./Cigna Corporation and the July 2015 Aetna Inc./Humana Inc. transactions of 12.5x and 12.6x,
respectively. Lazard then applied a selected range of latest 12 months EBITDA multiples of 11.0x to 13.0x derived from the Aetna selected transactions
to Aetna’s calendar year 2017 estimated EBITDA utilizing the Aetna forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share

stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that CVS Health was forecasted to generate during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 through
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Lazard calculated a
range of estimated terminal values for CVS Health by applying to CVS Health’s estimated EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 a
range of EBITDA multiples of 9.0x to 10.0x selected based on Lazard’s professional judgment and taking into account, among other things, observed
implied calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples for the CVS Health selected companies (as defined below under the heading “—Selected
Public Companies Analysis”) and CVS Health. The cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of December 31,
2017) using a selected range of discount rates of 6.0% to 7.0% derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation. This analysis indicated the

operate. Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, private placements and related financings, bankruptcy reorganizations and similar recapitalizations, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course, Lazard and its affiliates
and employees may trade securities of Aetna, CVS Health and certain of their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their
customers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of Aetna, CVS Health and
certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard’s opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of Lazard.

For Lazard’s financial advisory services, Aetna has agreed to pay Lazard an aggregate fee of $50 million, of which $5 million was payable upon
delivery of Lazard’s opinion and $45 million is contingent upon completion of the merger. Aetna also has agreed subject to certain limitations to
reimburse Lazard’s reasonable expenses and to indemnify Lazard and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

Lazard in the past provided certain investment banking services to Aetna and/or certain of its affiliates unrelated to the merger, for which Lazard
received compensation, including, during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, having acted as a financial advisor to Aetna in connection
with its potential acquisition of Humana (which acquisition was not consummated), for which Lazard received from Aetna a fee of $5 million upon
delivery of its opinion to the Aetna board of directors in connection with such transaction. The financial advisory business of Lazard and its affiliates did
not provide services to CVS Health for which fees were received during the two-year period prior to December 3, 2017.

Opinion of Allen & Company LLC

Aetna also has engaged Allen & Company as a financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. In connection with this engagement,
Aetna requested that Allen & Company render an opinion to the Aetna board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of Aetna common shares of the consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. On December 3, 2017, at a meeting of
the Aetna board of directors held to evaluate the merger, Allen & Company rendered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated December 3, 2017, to the Aetna board of directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion, the consideration to be
received by holders of Aetna common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of Allen & Company’s written opinion, dated December 3, 2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C and is incorporated by reference herein in its
entirety. The description of Allen & Company’s opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of Allen & Company’s opinion. Allen & Company’s opinion was intended for the benefit and use of the Aetna board of directors (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other
terms, aspects or implications of the merger. Allen & Company’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation as to the course of action that
Aetna (or the Aetna board of directors) should pursue in connection with the merger or otherwise address the merits of the underlying decision
by Aetna to engage in the merger, including in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Aetna or which Aetna
might engage in or consider. Allen & Company’s opinion does not constitute advice or a recommendation to any shareholder as to how such
shareholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the merger or otherwise.

Allen & Company’s opinion reflected and gave effect to Allen & Company’s general familiarity with Aetna and CVS Health as well as
information that Allen & Company received during the course of its assignment,

including information provided by the managements of Aetna and CVS Health in the course of discussions relating to the merger as more fully
described below. In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company neither conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Aetna, CVS Health

entity. Allen & Company is not an actuary and its services did not include any actuarial determination or evaluation by Allen & Company or any attempt
to evaluate actuarial assumptions or allowances for losses, uncollectible accounts, claims or other matters and, accordingly, Allen & Company assumed,
without independent analysis, the appropriateness of, and expressed no opinion or view as to, reserves.

with, such synergies, which are, collectively, referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the synergies, and certain
potential pro forma financial effects of the merger;

 

 
(vii) reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information, including certain stock market data and financial information, relating to

selected companies with businesses that Allen & Company deemed generally relevant in evaluating Aetna and CVS Health;

directed to utilize for purposes of its analyses, Allen & Company was advised by the management of Aetna, and Allen & Company assumed, at the
direction of Aetna, that such financial forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to, and were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future
financial and operating performance of Aetna, such synergies and the other matters covered thereby. With respect to the CVS Health forecasts
(including, without limitation, extrapolations therefrom) that Allen & Company was directed to utilize for purposes of its analyses, Allen & Company
was advised by the managements of CVS Health and Aetna, as the case may be, and Allen & Company assumed, at the direction of Aetna, that such
financial forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the respective managements of CVS Health and Aetna as to, and were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate,
the future financial and operating performance of CVS Health and the other matters covered thereby. Allen & Company also assumed, with the consent
of Aetna, that the financial results, including, without limitation, the synergies expected by the management of Aetna to result from the merger, reflected
in the financial forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data utilized in its analyses would be realized in the amounts and at the times
projected. Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any financial forecasts, estimates or other financial or operating data or the assumptions
on which they were based.

Allen & Company relied, at the direction of Aetna, upon the assessments of the managements of Aetna and CVS Health, as the case may be, as to,
among other things, (i) the potential impact on Aetna and CVS Health of certain market, cyclical, competitive and other trends and developments in and
prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative policies and matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the health care industry and health
care benefits sector thereof and the retail, pharmacy and pharmacy services industries, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to
government subsidized health care programs, capital requirements and reimbursement, (ii) existing and future contracts, agreements and arrangements
relating to, and the ability to attract, retain and/or replace, key commercial relationships of, Aetna and CVS Health, and (iii) the ability of CVS Health to
integrate the operations of Aetna and CVS Health. Allen & Company assumed, with the consent of Aetna, that there would be no developments with
respect to any such matters that would have an adverse effect on Aetna, CVS Health or the merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof) or that
otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to its analyses or opinion.

Further, Allen & Company’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Allen & Company as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect the
conclusion expressed in Allen & Company’s opinion and that Allen & Company assumed no responsibility for advising any person of any change in any
matter affecting Allen & Company’s opinion or for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of its
opinion. As the Aetna board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, and the industries in which Aetna and CVS Health operate,
have experienced and continue to experience volatility and Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility
on Aetna or CVS Health (or their respective businesses) or the merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof).

In connection with Allen & Company’s engagement, Allen & Company was not requested to, and it did not, solicit third-party indications of
interest with respect to the acquisition of all or a portion of Aetna. Allen & Company did not express any opinion as to the fairness, financial or
otherwise, of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation or other consideration payable to any officers, directors or employees of any
party to the merger or any related entities, or any class of such persons or any other party, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Allen &
Company expressed no opinion as to the actual value of shares of CVS Health common stock when issued in connection with the merger or the prices at
which Aetna common shares or shares of CVS Health common stock (or any other securities) may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time. In
addition, Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger or otherwise, including,
without limitation, the potential impact of changes in U.S. health care

and tax laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies on Aetna, CVS Health or the merger (or the contemplated benefits thereof), nor did
Allen & Company express any opinion or view as to, and Allen & Company relied, at the direction of Aetna, upon the assessments of representatives of
Aetna regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and actuarial matters relating to Aetna, CVS Health and the merger, as to which Allen & Company
understood that Aetna obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.

Allen & Company assumed, with the consent of Aetna, that the merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms and in compliance
with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement,
and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, releases, waivers, decrees and agreements
for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture or other requirements or remedies, amendments or modifications,
would be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on Aetna, CVS Health or the merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof) or that
otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to its analyses or opinion. Allen & Company further assumed, with the consent of Aetna, that the final
executed merger agreement would not differ from the draft reviewed by Allen & Company in any respect meaningful to Allen & Company’s analyses or
opinion.

Allen & Company’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of its date, of the merger consideration to be
received by holders of Aetna common shares pursuant to the merger agreement, without regard to individual circumstances of holders of Aetna common
shares that may distinguish such holders or the securities of Aetna held by such holders, and Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view with
respect to any consideration received in connection with the merger by the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party.
Allen & Company’s opinion did not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of
the merger or any terms, aspects or implications of any governance or other arrangements, agreements or understandings entered into in connection
with, related to or contemplated by the merger or otherwise.

In connection with its opinion, Allen & Company performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below.
The summary of the analyses below and certain factors considered is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered
by Allen & Company. The preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial
opinion and analyses are not readily susceptible to summary description. Allen & Company arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses
undertaken and assessed as a whole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis.
Accordingly, Allen & Company believes that the analyses and factors summarized below must be considered as a whole and in context. Allen &
Company further believes that selecting portions of the analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering
all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying
Allen & Company’s analyses and opinion.

In performing its financial analyses, Allen & Company considered industry performance, general business and economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Aetna and CVS Health. No company,
business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Aetna, CVS Health or their respective businesses or the merger and an evaluation
of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed.
The estimates of the future performance of Aetna and CVS Health in or underlying Allen & Company’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by such analyses. These
analyses were prepared solely as part of Allen &

Company’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to the Aetna board of directors in
connection with the delivery of Allen & Company’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company
might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the assumptions and
estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty
and should not be taken as the views of Allen & Company regarding the actual values of Aetna or CVS Health.

Allen & Company did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the merger. The type and
amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between Aetna and CVS Health, rather than by any financial
advisor, and was approved by the Aetna board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Aetna board of
directors and the CVS Health board of directors. Allen & Company’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Aetna
board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger and the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the
Aetna board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the merger.

Financial Analyses

The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “—Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial analyses
provided by Allen & Company in connection with its opinion, dated December 3, 2017, to the Aetna board of directors. The summary set forth below
is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Allen & Company in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the
analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses summarized
below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Allen & Company, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by Allen & Company. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
financial analyses performed by Allen & Company. Future results may differ from those described and such differences may be material. For
purposes of the financial analyses described below in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the term (i) “implied per share merger
consideration” means approximately $207.94 per share, calculated as the (a) cash consideration of $145.00 per share and (b) implied value of the stock
consideration of approximately $62.94 per share based on a 0.8378x per share exchange ratio and an illustrative reference closing price for CVS Health
common stock of $75.12 per share as of December 1, 2017, (ii) “EBITDA” means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
excluding certain one-time non-recurring items, as applicable, and (iii) “EPS” means earnings per share, excluding certain one-time, non-recurring or
non-cash items, as applicable. Financial data of Aetna, when utilizing Aetna’s closing share price on December 1, 2017, were pro forma for Aetna’s
completed sale of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses based on internal data provided by
the management of Aetna.

Aetna Financial Analyses

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Allen & Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna by calculating, based on the Aetna
forecasts, the estimated present value (as of December 1, 2017) of the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Aetna was forecasted to
generate during the month ending December 31, 2017 through the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based
compensation was treated as a cash expense. Allen & Company calculated a range of estimated terminal values for Aetna by applying a range of
perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% to Aetna’s stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022
(assuming, for purposes of the terminal year, growth in risk-based capital contributions commensurate with premium revenue growth),

which range of perpetuity growth rates was selected based on Allen & Company’s professional judgment and taking into account, among other things,
the Aetna forecasts and trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and sectors in which Aetna operates. The cash flows and range of
terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of December 1, 2017) using a selected range of discount rates of 7.0% to 8.5% derived from a
weighted average cost of capital calculation. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Aetna,
as compared to the implied per share merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value
Reference Range   

Implied Per Share

$137 – $231   $207.94

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Allen & Company reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of Aetna and the
following four selected large cap publicly traded managed care companies that, given business and financial characteristics, Allen & Company
considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis, which are referred to for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Aetna selected companies:
 

 •  Anthem, Inc.
 

 •  Cigna Corporation
 

 •  Humana Inc.
 

 •  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated

Allen & Company reviewed, among other information, closing stock prices as of, in the case of the Aetna selected companies, December 1, 2017
(the last trading day prior to the date of the merger agreement) and, in the case of Aetna, October 25, 2017 (the last trading day prior to initial published
reports regarding a potential acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health) and December 1, 2017, as a multiple of calendar year 2018 estimated EPS. Allen &
Company also reviewed enterprise values, calculated as fully diluted equity values based on closing stock prices as of, in the case of the Aetna selected
companies, December 1, 2017 and, in the case of Aetna, October 25, 2017 and December 1, 2017, plus total debt, preferred stock and non-controlling
interests (as applicable) and less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and unconsolidated investments (as applicable), as a multiple of calendar year
2018 estimated EBITDA. Financial data of the Aetna selected companies were based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’
estimates and other publicly available information.

The overall low to high calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for the Aetna
selected companies based on closing stock prices on December 1, 2017 were 18.0x to 21.4x (with a mean and a median of 19.6x) and 10.2x to 12.8x
(with a mean of 11.4x and a median of 11.3x), respectively. Allen & Company noted that the calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples observed for
Aetna, utilizing publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and the Aetna forecasts, were 15.9x and 16.0x, respectively (based on Aetna’s
closing share price on October 25, 2017), and 18.0x and 18.1x, respectively (based on Aetna’s closing share price on December 1, 2017). Allen &
Company also noted that the calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for Aetna, utilizing publicly available Wall Street research
analysts’ estimates and the Aetna forecasts, were 9.6x and 10.2x, respectively (based on Aetna’s closing share price on October 25, 2017), and 10.6x and
11.0x, respectively (based on Aetna’s closing share price on December 1, 2017).

Allen & Company then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2018 estimated EPS and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples derived
from the Aetna selected companies of 18.0x to 20.0x and 10.0x to 12.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of Aetna utilizing the Aetna forecasts. This
analysis indicated the following

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Using publicly available information, Allen & Company reviewed financial information relating to the
following seven selected transactions involving target managed care organizations that, given business and financial characteristics, Allen & Company
considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis, which are referred to for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Aetna selected transactions:

October 2011   •   Cigna Corporation   •   HealthSpring, Inc.

Allen & Company reviewed, among other information, transaction values of the Aetna selected transactions, calculated as the enterprise values
implied for the target companies based on the consideration paid or payable in the Aetna selected transactions, as a multiple, to the extent publicly
available, of the target company’s latest 12 months EBITDA and forward estimated EBITDA, as of the applicable announcement date of such
transaction. Financial data for the Aetna selected transactions were based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates
and other publicly available information.

The overall low to high latest 12 months EBITDA multiples and forward estimated EBITDA multiples observed for the Aetna selected
transactions were 8.0x to 16.2x (with a mean of 11.7x and a median of 12.6x) and 7.2x to 12.3x (with a mean of 9.5x and a median of 9.8x),
respectively. Allen & Company then applied a selected range of latest 12 months EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to 13.0x and forward estimated EBITDA
multiples of 9.5x to 12.5x, in each case derived from the Aetna selected transactions, to Aetna’s latest 12 months EBITDA (as of September 30, 2017)
utilizing publicly available information and internal data provided by the management of Aetna and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA utilizing the
Aetna forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Aetna, as compared to the
implied per share merger consideration:

Shortly following the December 3, 2017 meeting of the Aetna board of directors, Aetna discovered that in calculating its latest 12 months
EBITDA (as of September 30, 2017) for its financial advisors, Aetna had inadvertently overstated the interest related to certain debt incurred in
connection with the proposed Humana acquisition. Aetna confirmed that the impact of the inclusion of the additional interest was immaterial and did not

selected range of latest 12 months EBITDA multiples referred to above to Aetna’s corrected latest 12 months EBITDA (as of September 30, 2017)
would have indicated a lower approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Aetna derived from the analysis described above of $161
to $216. The inclusion of the additional interest in the calculation of Aetna’s latest 12 months EBITDA (as of September 30, 2017) had no other impact
on the financial analyses described in this section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus.

CVS Health Financial Analyses

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Allen & Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CVS Health by calculating, based on the CVS
Health forecasts, the estimated present value (as of December 1, 2017) of the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that CVS Health was
forecasted to generate during the month ending December 31, 2017 through the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. For purposes of this analysis,
stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Allen & Company calculated a range of estimated terminal values for CVS Health by applying
a range of perpetuity growth rates of 1.0% to 1.5% to CVS Health’s stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows during the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2022 (assuming, for purposes of the terminal year, normalized depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures and sale-leaseback
proceeds), which range of perpetuity growth rates was selected based on Allen & Company’s professional judgment and taking into account, among
other things, the CVS Health forecasts and trends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and sectors in which CVS Health operates. The
cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of December 1, 2017) using a selected range of discount rates of 6.0%
to 7.5% derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value
reference range for CVS Health, as compared to the per share closing price of CVS Health common stock on December 1, 2017:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Allen & Company reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of CVS Health and
the following seven selected publicly traded drug store companies, pharmacy benefit management services companies and mass merchant companies
that, given certain business and financial characteristics, Allen & Company considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis, which are referred to
for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health selected companies:
 

 •  Costco Wholesale Corporation
 

 •  Express Scripts Holding Company
 

 •  The Kroger Co.
 

 •  Rite Aid Corporation
 

 •  Target Corporation
 

 •  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.
 

 •  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Allen & Company reviewed, among other information, closing stock prices as of, in the case of the CVS Health selected companies, December 1,
2017 and, in the case of CVS Health, November 29, 2017 (the last trading day prior to additional published reports regarding a potential acquisition of
Aetna by CVS Health) and

December 1, 2017, as a multiple, to the extent meaningful, of calendar year 2018 estimated EPS. Allen & Company also reviewed enterprise values,
calculated as fully diluted equity values based on closing stock prices as of, in the case of the CVS Health selected companies, December 1, 2017 and, in
the case of CVS Health, November 29, 2017 and December 1, 2017, plus total debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests (as applicable) and less
cash and cash equivalents and unconsolidated investments (as applicable), as a multiple of calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA. Financial data of the
CVS Health selected companies (pro forma for certain recent acquisitions or divestitures or the loss of certain commercial arrangements, as applicable)
were based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and other publicly available information and calendarized to a
December 31 year-end when necessary. Financial data of CVS Health were pro forma for CVS Health’s announced divestiture of RxCrossroads based
on publicly available information.

The overall low to high calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for the CVS
Health selected companies based on closing stock prices as of December 1, 2017 were 12.5x to 27.8x (with a mean of 16.8x and a median of 13.5x) and
6.5x to 13.8x (with a mean of 8.7x and a median of 8.5x), respectively. Allen & Company noted that the calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples
observed for CVS Health, utilizing publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and the CVS Health forecasts, were 11.6x and 11.6x,
respectively (based on CVS Health’s closing stock price on November 29, 2017), and 11.8x and 11.9x, respectively (based on CVS Health’s closing
stock price on December 1, 2017). Allen & Company also noted that the calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for CVS Health,
utilizing publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and the CVS Health forecasts, were 7.6x and 7.4x, respectively (based on CVS
Health’s closing stock price on November 29, 2017), and 7.7x and 7.6x, respectively (based on CVS Health’s closing stock price on December 1, 2017).

Allen & Company then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2018 estimated EPS and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples derived
from the CVS Health selected companies of 11.0x to 14.0x and 8.0x to 9.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of CVS Health utilizing the CVS Health
forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for CVS Health, as compared to the per

Miscellaneous

Aetna selected Allen & Company as a financial advisor in connection with the merger based on, among other things, Allen & Company’s
reputation, experience and familiarity with Aetna and the industries in which Aetna and CVS Health operate. Allen & Company, as part of its
investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private
placements and related financings, bankruptcy reorganizations and similar recapitalizations, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed
and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course, Allen & Company as a broker-dealer and certain of
Allen & Company’s affiliates (including a senior member of the team assisting in providing Allen & Company’s financial advisory services to Aetna in
connection with the merger) and/or related entities have invested or may invest, hold long or short positions and may trade, either on a discretionary or
non-discretionary basis, for their own account or for those of Allen & Company’s clients, in the debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) of Aetna, CVS Health and/or their respective affiliates. The issuance of Allen & Company’s opinion was approved by Allen & Company’s
fairness opinion committee.

For Allen & Company’s financial advisory services, Aetna has agreed to pay Allen & Company an aggregate fee of $50 million, of which
$5 million was payable upon delivery of Allen & Company’s opinion and $45 million is contingent upon completion of the merger. Aetna also has
agreed subject to certain limitations to reimburse Allen & Company’s reasonable expenses and to indemnify Allen & Company and related parties
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

As the Aetna board of directors was aware, Allen & Company in the past has provided and in the future may provide, investment banking services
to Aetna and/or its affiliates unrelated to the merger, for which services Allen & Company may receive compensation, including, during the two-year
period prior to December 3, 2017, acting or having acted as financial advisor to Aetna in connection with certain potential transactions and strategic
advisory matters, for which no fees were received. Allen & Company and its affiliates did not provide financial advisory services to CVS Health for
which fees were received during the two-year period prior to December  3, 2017.

acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. CVS Health’s board of directors selected Barclays because of its
familiarity with CVS Health and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions generally, as well as its substantial experience in transactions comparable to the merger.

Barclays is acting as financial advisor to CVS Health in connection with the merger. As compensation for its services in connection with the
merger, CVS Health has agreed to pay Barclays a transaction fee of $52 million, $5 million of which became payable upon the delivery of the Barclays

opinion or completion of the merger. In addition, CVS Health has agreed to reimburse Barclays for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the merger and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by CVS Health and the rendering of
Barclays’ opinion. Barclays and its affiliates have performed various investment banking and financial services for CVS Health, Aetna and their
respective affiliates in the past, and expect to perform such services in the future, and have received, and expect to receive, customary fees for such

banking and financial services provided by its investment banking division to CVS Health and/or its affiliates of $23 million. During the two-year
period ended December 3, 2017, Barclays received compensation for investment banking and financial services provided by its investment banking
division to Aetna and/or its affiliates of $28 million. In addition, at the request of CVS Health, an affiliate of Barclays (i) entered into financing
commitments and agreements with other banks and financial institutions to provide CVS Health with a $49 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge
facility and (ii) entered into a first amendment to each of CVS Health’s existing revolving credit facilities (consisting of (A) a $1.0 billion, 364-day
unsecured credit facility expiring on May 17, 2018, (B) a $1.25 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on July 24, 2019, (C) a

the debt financing for the merger will depend upon, among other things, the timing of reductions of the bridge loan commitments, the completion date of
the merger, CVS Health’s credit rating and the issuance costs for such debt financing. CVS Health estimates that Barclays and its affiliates will in
aggregate receive approximately $142 million in fees in connection with the bridge loan facility, term loan facility and bond issuance. This estimate is
based on various assumptions, including, without limitation, that CVS Health will incur permanent debt financing in connection with the proposed
transaction and will receive an investment grade credit rating from Moody’s and S&P. Also, Barclays and its affiliates have executed various share
repurchase, hedging, derivative and other securities transactions and provided other risk management and equity origination services for CVS Health
and its affiliates, as well as executed various hedging, derivative and other securities transactions and provided other risk management and equity
origination services for Aetna and its affiliates.

Barclays and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses, including investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management and
other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of their businesses, Barclays and its affiliates may actively trade and effect transactions
in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of CVS Health
and Aetna for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments
in such securities and financial instruments.

As discussed under “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock
Issuance—CVS Health’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the CVS Health Board of Directors that CVS Health Stockholders Approve the
Stock Issuance” beginning on page 107 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Barclays’ opinion to CVS Health’s board of directors was one of many
factors taken into consideration by the CVS Health board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger.

Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to CVS Health’s board of directors that, as of December 3, 2017 and based upon and subject to the
qualifications, limitations, factors and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid by CVS Health in the merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to CVS Health.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, dated as of December 3, 2017, is attached as Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Goldman Sachs’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Goldman Sachs in connection with the opinion. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of CVS Health’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of CVS Health common stock or Aetna common shares
should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
 

 •  the merger agreement;
 

 
•  annual reports to shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of CVS Health and Aetna for each of the five years ended December 31,

2016;
 

 •  certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of CVS Health and Aetna;

 •  the Aetna forecasts, the CVS Health forecasts, the adjusted Aetna forecasts and the CVS Health pro forma forecasts; and
 

 •  the expected synergies.

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of CVS Health and Aetna regarding their assessment of the past
and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Aetna and with the members of senior management of CVS Health regarding
their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of CVS Health and the strategic rationale for, and
the potential benefits of, the merger; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of CVS Health common stock and the Aetna
common shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for CVS Health and Aetna with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the health insurance
industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with CVS Health’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of
all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by it, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with CVS Health’s consent that the CVS Health forecasts,
the adjusted Aetna forecasts, the CVS Health pro forma forecasts and the expected synergies were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of CVS Health. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of
the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of CVS Health or Aetna or any of their
respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs is not an actuary and its services did not include
any actuarial determination or evaluation by Goldman Sachs or any attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions, and Goldman Sachs has relied on CVS
Health’s actuaries with respect to reserve adequacy. In that regard, Goldman Sachs has made no analysis of, and expressed no opinion as to, the
adequacy of the loss and loss adjustments expenses reserves, the future policy benefit reserves, the long-term business provision and claims outstanding
or the embedded value of CVS Health and Aetna. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary
for completion of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on CVS Health or Aetna or on the expected benefits of the merger in any way
meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of CVS Health to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to CVS Health; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to CVS Health, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger
consideration to be paid by CVS Health in the merger. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by,
the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of CVS Health; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation
to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of CVS Health or Aetna, or any class of such persons in connection with the merger,
whether relative to the merger consideration to be paid by CVS Health in the merger or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on
economic, monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion, and Goldman
Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the
date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares

of CVS Health common stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of CVS Health or Aetna or the ability
of CVS Health or Aetna to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of
Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any
time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments of CVS Health, Aetna and any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the merger contemplated by the merger agreement for the accounts of Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees and their customers.
Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to CVS Health in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. At the
request of CVS Health, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs (i) entered into financing commitments and agreements with other banks and financial institutions
to provide CVS Health with a $49 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and (ii) entered into a first amendment to each of CVS Health’s
existing revolving credit facilities (consisting of (A) a $1.0 billion, 364-day unsecured credit facility expiring on May 17, 2018, (B) a $1.25 billion, five-
year unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on July 24, 2019, (C) a $1.25 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on July 1, 2020
and (D) a $1.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility expiring on May 18, 2022) with other banks and financial institutions party thereto.
An affiliate of Goldman Sachs acted as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner and acts as one of the lenders and administrative agent, in each case, on
a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion consisting of a $3.0 billion three-year tranche and a $2.0 billion
five-year tranche. An affiliate of Goldman Sachs may also act as active lead joint bookrunner with respect to a bond issuance by CVS Health. The actual
amount of aggregate fees to be received by Goldman Sachs and its affiliates in connection with the debt financing for the merger will depend upon,
among other things, the timing of reductions of the bridge loan commitments, the completion date of the merger, CVS Health’s credit rating and the
issuance costs for such debt financing. CVS Health estimates that Goldman Sachs and its affiliates will in aggregate receive approximately $142 million
in fees in connection with the bridge loan facility, term loan facility and bond issuance. This estimate is based on various assumptions, including,
without limitation, that CVS Health will incur permanent debt financing in connection with the proposed transaction and will receive an investment
grade credit rating from Moody’s and S&P. Except as disclosed herein with respect to the contemplated transaction, during the two-year period ended
December 3, 2017, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by CVS Health or its affiliates to provide financial
advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has received compensation. Goldman Sachs has provided certain investment banking
services to Aetna and its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive,
compensation, including having acted as lead bookrunner in the structuring of catastrophe bonds (aggregate principal amount $200 million) by Vitality
Re VII Limited, a vehicle linked to a portfolio of Aetna insurance products, in January 2016; as lead bookrunner in the structuring of catastrophe bonds
(aggregate principal amount $200 million) by Vitality Re VIII Limited, a vehicle linked to a portfolio of Aetna insurance products, in January 2017; and
as co-manager with respect to a $1 billion bond offering by Aetna in August 2017. During the two-year period ended December 3, 2017, Goldman
Sachs received compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Aetna and/or its
affiliates of less than $5 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide investment banking services to CVS Health, Aetna and their respective
affiliates for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.

The board of directors of CVS Health selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated November 30, 2017, CVS Health
engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated merger. Pursuant to an engagement letter between CVS
Health and Goldman Sachs, CVS Health has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of $52 million,

$5 million of which became payable upon execution of the merger agreement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon completion of the merger.
In addition, CVS Health has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to
indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

As discussed under “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock
Issuance—CVS Health’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the CVS Health Board of Directors that CVS Health Stockholders Approve the
Stock Issuance” beginning on page 107 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to CVS Health’s board of directors was one of
many factors taken into consideration by the CVS Health board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays and Goldman Sachs in preparing their respective opinions to CVS
Health’s board of directors. The following summary is not a complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying their opinions, nor does the
order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.

In connection with rendering their respective opinions, Barclays and Goldman Sachs performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses
as summarized below. In arriving at their respective opinions, Barclays and Goldman Sachs did not ascribe a specific range of values to Aetna common
shares or shares of CVS Health common stock but rather made their determinations as to fairness, from a financial point of view, to CVS Health of the
merger consideration to be paid by CVS Health in the merger on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses.

In arriving at their respective opinions, Barclays and Goldman Sachs did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor
considered by them but rather made their determinations as to fairness on the basis of their experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all of their analyses and made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other
analyses and factors performed and considered by them and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays and
Goldman Sachs believe that their respective analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without
considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying their respective opinions.

For the purposes of their analyses and reviews, Barclays and Goldman Sachs made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of CVS Health, Aetna or any other
parties to the merger. No company, business or transaction considered in Barclays’ or Goldman Sachs’ analyses and reviews is identical to CVS Health,
Aetna or the proposed transaction, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and
reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ analyses and
reviews. None of CVS Health, Aetna, Barclays, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those discussed. Any estimates or forecasts of future results contained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or
reflect the prices at which the companies,

businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ analyses
and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

The summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays and Goldman Sachs, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as
the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without
considering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ analyses and reviews. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative
information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 1, 2017, the last trading day before
the public announcement of the transaction, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

The terms of the merger were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between CVS Health and Aetna and were unanimously approved by
CVS Health’s board of directors. Barclays and Goldman Sachs provided advice to CVS Health during these negotiations. Barclays and Goldman Sachs
did not recommend any specific form or amount of consideration to the board of directors of CVS Health or that any specific form or amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

Selected Comparable Company Analysis

In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a range of relative implied equity
values per Aetna common share by reference to those companies, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial and operating data relating to
Aetna with selected companies that Barclays, based on its experience in the managed care industry, deemed comparable to Aetna. The selected
comparable companies with respect to Aetna were:
 

 •  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated
 

 •  Anthem, Inc.
 

 •  Cigna Corporation
 

 •  Humana Inc.

Barclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of Aetna and the selected comparable companies. As part of its selected
comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed each company’s ratio of its stock price as of December 1, 2017 to its projected adjusted
earnings per share, which is referred to for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a price to earnings ratio or P/E multiple.
Where applicable, the P/E multiples were adjusted to account for certain events such as acquisitions and divestitures. All of these calculations were
performed and based on publicly available financial data (including Wall Street research, FactSet data and SEC filings) and closing prices as of
December 1, 2017, the last trading date prior to the delivery of Barclays’ opinion, and the adjusted Aetna forecasts. The selected comparable company
analysis provides an illustrative valuation of Aetna and the selected comparable companies in a stand-alone context and not in a change-of-control
context.

The high, mean, median and low adjusted P/E multiples for calendar year 2018 observed for the selected companies were as follows:
 

     2018E Adj. P/E Multiples
High     21.4
Mean     19.6
Median     19.6
Low     18.0

Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more business or operating characteristics with Aetna.
However, because of the inherent differences between the business, operations and prospects of Aetna and those of the selected comparable companies,
Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis.
Accordingly, Barclays also made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and
prospects of Aetna and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to
consider the results of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels
and degree of operational risk between Aetna and the companies included in the selected comparable company analysis.

Based upon these judgments and its experience, Barclays selected a range of 17.0x to 18.5x multiples of the projected 2018 adjusted earnings per
share, which is referred to for purposes of this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as EPS, for Aetna and applied such range to the projected
2018 adjusted EPS of $10.01 based on the adjusted Aetna forecasts to calculate a range, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of implied equity values per Aetna
common share as follows:
 

Selected Adj. P/E Multiples   Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
17.0x – 18.5x   $170.25 – $185.25

Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis

Barclays and Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples paid in selected other managed care transactions
that Barclays and Goldman Sachs, based on their experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed relevant. Barclays and Goldman Sachs
chose such transactions based on, among other things, the similarity of the applicable target companies to Aetna with respect to the characteristics of
their businesses. The selected transactions were as follows:

For each transaction, Barclays and Goldman Sachs calculated the next-twelve-months P/E multiples based on information they obtained from SEC
filings, IBES estimates and FactSet data by comparing the transaction value per share at announcement to the target company’s next-twelve-months EPS
based on IBES consensus projections as of the one trading day prior to announcement or, where applicable, prior to rumor or leak. For the transactions
which included a stock component as part of the merger consideration, the transaction value per share at announcement was calculated by Barclays and
Goldman Sachs based upon the acquiror closing share price as of the one trading day prior to the date of announcement.

The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent
differences in the businesses, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Aetna and the companies included in the selected precedent transaction
analysis. Based upon their professional judgment and experience, Barclays selected a range of 19.0x to 22.0x next-twelve-months P/E multiples and
applied such range to the projected next-twelve-months (as of December 1, 2017) adjusted EPS of $10.00 based on the adjusted Aetna forecasts, and
Goldman Sachs selected a range of 15.0x to 21.5x next-twelve-months P/E multiples and applied such range to the projected next-twelve-months (as of
September 30, 2017) adjusted EPS of $9.97 based on the adjusted Aetna forecasts, in each case, to calculate a range, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of
implied equity values per Aetna common share as follows:
 

   Selected P/E Multiples  Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
Barclays   19.0x – 22.0x   $190.00 – $220.00
Goldman Sachs   15.0x – 21.5x   $149.50 – $214.25

Transaction Premium Analysis

Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Barclays and Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared the premiums paid in selected other managed care transactions that Barclays and Goldman
Sachs, based on their experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed relevant. Barclays and Goldman Sachs chose such transactions based

Table of Contents

For each transaction, Barclays and Goldman Sachs calculated the premium per share paid by the acquiror based on information they obtained from
SEC filings, IBES estimates and FactSet data by comparing the transaction value per share at announcement to the target company’s: (i) closing share
price as of the one trading day prior to announcement or, where applicable, prior to rumor or leak and (ii) historical high closing share price during the
52-week period ending the one trading day prior to announcement or, where applicable, prior to rumor or leak. For the transactions which included a
stock component as part of the merger consideration, the transaction value per share at announcement was calculated by Barclays and Goldman Sachs
based upon the acquiror closing share price as of the one trading day prior to the date of announcement. The high, mean, median and low premiums
observed for the selected transactions were as follows:
 

 
  Premiums  
  1-Day  52-Week High 

High    43.0%   35.0% 
Mean    23.1%   12.2% 
Median    21.2%   13.7% 
Low    9.4%   (25.1%) 

Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the transactions analyzed in the transaction premium analysis were diverse and there
are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Aetna and the companies included in the transaction premium
analysis. Based upon its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs selected a range of 18.0% to 27.0% premiums (based on the 25th and
75th percentiles from the above 1-Day analysis) to the closing price of Aetna common shares on the unaffected date to calculate a range, rounded to the
nearest $0.25, of implied equity values per Aetna common share as follows:
 

Selected Premiums   Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
18.0% – 27.0%   $189.00 – $203.25

Barclays did not calculate implied equity values per Aetna common share as part of its transaction premium analysis.

Large Transactions Premiums Analysis

Using Thomson Reuters data as of December 1, 2017, Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed the acquisition premiums for transactions
announced during the time period from January 1, 2013 through December 1, 2017 involving a public company based in the United States as the target
where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was greater than $25 billion. For the entire period, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th
percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the 25 transactions relative to the target’s closing stock price one day prior to original
announcement of the transaction as determined by Thomson Reuters. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29.0% across the period. This
analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 18.2% and 75th percentile premium of 36.4% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman
Sachs applied a reference range of premiums of 18.0% to 36.5% to the undisturbed closing price per Aetna common share of $160.12 as of the
unaffected date and calculated a range, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of implied equity values per Aetna common share as follows:
 

Selected Premiums   Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
18.0% – 36.5%   $189.00 – $218.50

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.

In order to estimate the illustrative present values of shares of CVS Health common stock, Aetna common shares (excluding and including the
expected synergies) and shares of the combined company, Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of each of CVS Health, Aetna and the
combined company. A

Table of Contents

discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of a company by calculating the “present value” of
estimated future cash flows of the company. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting
those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of
capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of Aetna

Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna based on estimates of unlevered free cash flows of Aetna as reflected in the adjusted
Aetna forecasts to derive a range of implied present values per Aetna common share as of September 30, 2017. Utilizing discount rates ranging from
6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting estimates of Aetna’s weighted average cost of capital, Barclays derived a range of implied enterprise values for Aetna by
discounting to present value as of September 30, 2017, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows of Aetna for the three months ending December 31,
2017, which were calculated using the adjusted Aetna forecasts and approved for Barclays’ use by CVS Health, and each of the fiscal years 2018
through 2022, as reflected in the adjusted Aetna forecasts, and (ii) a range of terminal values for Aetna derived by applying perpetuity growth rates
ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% to the estimated terminal unlevered free cash flow for Aetna calculated based upon the adjusted Aetna forecasts. Barclays
derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s
target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate
and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates
was estimated by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the adjusted Aetna forecasts and market expectations
regarding long term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Barclays then added the present value of the terminal value to the present
values of the unlevered free cash flows for the three months ending December 31, 2017 and each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022 and subtracted
the assumed amount of Aetna’s net debt (as of September 30, 2017 and based on guidance from CVS Health management) to calculate a range of equity
values for Aetna. Barclays then divided this range of equity values by the number of fully diluted Aetna common shares based on data provided by CVS
Health management to derive a range, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of present values per Aetna common share as indicated in the table below.

Barclays also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna including the expected synergies based on estimates of unlevered free cash
flows of Aetna as reflected in and calculated using the adjusted Aetna forecasts and approved for Barclays’ use by CVS Health, and as reflected in the
expected synergies to derive a range of implied present values per Aetna common share including the expected synergies as of September 30, 2017.
Utilizing discount rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting estimates of Aetna’s weighted average cost of capital, Barclays derived a range of implied
values of the expected synergies by discounting to present value as of September 30, 2017, (i) the expected synergies for each of the fiscal years 2018
through 2022 and (ii) a terminal value for the expected synergies derived by applying a perpetuity growth rate of 1.5% to the estimated terminal year
expected synergies. Barclays derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific
inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future
applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The
perpetuity growth rate was estimated by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the adjusted Aetna forecasts
and market expectations regarding long term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Barclays then added the low end of the range of
present value expected synergies to the low end of the range of present value equity values of Aetna calculated above and added the high end of the
range of present value expected synergies to the high end of the range of present value equity values of Aetna calculated above to derive a present value
equity value range including the expected synergies. Barclays calculated a range of implied equity values per Aetna common share using the same

method described above. Barclays’ analysis implied a range, rounded to the nearest $0.25 and including the expected synergies, of present values per
Aetna common share as indicated in the table below:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of CVS Health

Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CVS Health based on estimates of unlevered free cash flows of CVS Health, which were
calculated using the CVS Health forecasts and approved for Barclays’ use by CVS Health, to derive a range of implied present values per share of CVS
Health common stock as of September 30, 2017. Utilizing discount rates ranging from 6.0% to 7.0%, reflecting estimates of CVS Health’s weighted
average cost of capital, Barclays derived a range of implied enterprise values for CVS Health by discounting to present value as of September 30, 2017,
(i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows of CVS Health for the three months ending December 31, 2017 and each of the fiscal years 2018 through
2022, which were calculated using the CVS Health forecasts and approved for Barclays’ use by CVS Health, and (ii) a range of terminal values for CVS
Health derived by applying a range of terminal value multiples based on EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 of 6.5x to 9.5x to the
estimated terminal EBITDA for CVS Health calculated based upon the CVS Health forecasts. Barclays derived such discount rates by application of the
Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of
long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. In selecting the range of terminal value multiples based on EBITDA for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2022, Barclays made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment. Barclays then added the
present value of the terminal value to the present values of the unlevered free cash flows for the three months ending December 31, 2017 and each of the
fiscal years 2018 through 2022, and subtracted the assumed amount of CVS Health’s net debt and the book value of minority interests (each as of
September 30, 2017 and based on guidance from CVS Health management) to calculate a range of equity values for CVS Health. Barclays then divided
this range of equity values by the number of fully diluted shares of CVS Health common stock based on data provided by CVS Health management to
derive a range of present values per share of CVS Health common stock as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
$75.10 – $112.93

Illustrative Pro Forma Combined Company

To calculate the range of illustrative equity values of the combined company using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays (i) added the low
and high estimates in the range of estimated equity values of CVS Health calculated above to the low and high estimates in the range of estimated equity
values of Aetna (excluding the expected synergies) calculated above, respectively, (ii) calculated the range of illustrative values of the expected
synergies using the same assumptions used for the expected synergies analysis above, except that Barclays used perpetuity growth rates ranging from
1.0% to 2.0%, and added the low and high estimates in the range of estimated values of the expected synergies to the low and high estimated combined
equity values calculated in (i), (iii) subtracted from this range of equity values the amount of new debt expected from the transaction as based on
guidance from CVS Health management, and finally, (iv) divided this range of equity values by the sum of the number of fully diluted shares of CVS
Health common stock based on data provided by CVS Health management plus the number of new shares of CVS Health common stock expected to be
issued as part of the transaction based on data provided by CVS Health management. The range of perpetuity growth rates used with respect to the
expected synergies was estimated by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of Aetna

Goldman Sachs performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna (excluding and including the expected synergies) based on estimates of
unlevered free cash flows of Aetna as reflected in the adjusted Aetna forecasts and, as applicable, the expected synergies, to derive a range of implied
present values per Aetna common share as of September 30, 2017. Utilizing discount rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting estimates of Aetna’s
weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of implied enterprise values for Aetna by discounting to present value as of
September 30, 2017, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows of Aetna for the three months ending December 31, 2017, which were calculated using
the adjusted Aetna forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CVS Health, and each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022, as reflected in the
adjusted Aetna forecasts (each excluding and including the expected synergies), and (ii) a range of terminal values for Aetna (excluding and including
the expected synergies) derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% to CVS Health’s estimated terminal unlevered free cash
flow for Aetna as reflected in the adjusted Aetna forecasts. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing
Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax
yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and
experience, taking into account the adjusted Aetna forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and
inflation. Goldman Sachs then added the present value of each terminal value to the present values of each of the unlevered free cash flows for the three
months ending December 31, 2017 and each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022 and subtracted the assumed amount of Aetna’s net debt (as of
September 30, 2017 and based on guidance from CVS Health management) to calculate a range of equity values for Aetna (excluding and including the
expected synergies). Goldman Sachs then divided these ranges of equity values by the number of fully diluted Aetna common shares based on data
provided by CVS Health management to derive ranges, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of present values per Aetna common share as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
(Excluding Expected Synergies)   (Including Expected Synergies)

$159.50 – $235.50   $180.50 – $267.00

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of CVS Health

Goldman Sachs performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CVS Health based on estimates of unlevered free cash flows of CVS Health, which
were calculated using the CVS Health forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CVS Health, to derive a range of implied present values per
share for CVS Health as of September 30, 2017. Utilizing discount rates ranging from 6.25% to 7.25%, reflecting estimates of CVS Health’s weighted
average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of implied enterprise values for CVS Health by discounting to present value as of September 30,
2017, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows of CVS Health for the three months ending December 31, 2017 and each of the fiscal years 2018
through 2022, which were calculated using the CVS Health forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CVS Health, and (ii) a range of terminal
values for CVS Health derived by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% to the estimated terminal unlevered free cash flow for
CVS Health, which were calculated using the CVS Health forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CVS Health. Goldman Sachs derived such
discount rates by application of the

Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of
long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account the CVS Health forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross
domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs then added the present value of the terminal value to the present values of the unlevered free cash flows
for the three months ending December 31, 2017 and each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022 and subtracted the assumed amount of CVS Health’s net
debt and the book value of minority interests (each as of September 30, 2017 and based on guidance from CVS Health management) to calculate a range
of equity values for CVS Health. Goldman Sachs then divided this range of equity values by the number of fully diluted shares of CVS Health common
stock based on data provided by CVS Health management to derive a range of present values per share of CVS Health common stock as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range
$80.30 – $118.84

Illustrative Pro Forma Combined Company

Goldman Sachs performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the combined company based on estimates of unlevered free cash flows of the
combined company, which were calculated using the CVS Health pro forma forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CVS Health, and the
expected synergies to derive a range of implied present values per share of the combined company as of September 30, 2017. Utilizing discount rates
ranging from 6.25% to 7.25%, reflecting pro forma estimates of the weighted average cost of capital of the combined company following completion of
the merger, Goldman Sachs derived a range of implied enterprise values for the combined company by discounting to present value as of September 30,
2018, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows and the expected synergies of the combined company for the three months ending December 31, 2018
and each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2022, which were calculated using the CVS Health pro forma forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use
by CVS Health, and expected synergies and (ii) a range of terminal values for the combined company derived by applying perpetuity growth rates
ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% to the estimated terminal unlevered free cash flow and the expected synergies for the combined company, which were
calculated using the CVS Health pro forma forecasts and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by CVS Health, and the expected synergies. Goldman Sachs
derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company’s
target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate
and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates
was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the CVS Health forecasts and adjusted Aetna
forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs then (i) added the present
value (as of September 30, 2018) of the terminal value to the present values (as of September 30, 2018) of the unlevered free cash flows and the
expected synergies for the three months ending December 31, 2018 and each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2022, (ii) added the total CVS Health
dividends and Aetna dividends expected to be paid between September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018, as reflected in the CVS Health forecasts and
the adjusted Aetna forecasts and (iii) subtracted the assumed amount of the combined company’s net debt and the book value of minority interests (each
based on guidance from CVS Health management) to calculate a range of equity values for the combined company. Goldman Sachs then divided this
range of equity values by the number of pro forma fully diluted shares of common stock for the combined company based on data provided by CVS
Health management. Goldman Sachs then discounted the equity values per share to September 30, 2017 based on a cost of equity of 7.8% to derive a
range of present values per share of the common shares of the combined company as follows:
 

Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range

Illustrative Future Share Price Analysis

Barclays and Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the illustrative future value per share of CVS Health common stock, which is
designed to provide an indication of the theoretical future value of a company’s shares of common stock, both as a stand-alone entity and as the pro
forma combined company, as a function of the stand-alone entity’s and the pro forma combined company’s respective financial multiples. Goldman
Sachs then performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the illustrative future value per share of CVS Health common stock, which
is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company’s shares of common stock, both as a stand-alone
entity and as the pro forma combined company. For the analysis of the illustrative future value per share of CVS Health common stock, Barclays and
Goldman Sachs used the CVS Health forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2022 and the CVS Health pro forma forecasts and the expected
synergies for each of the fiscal years 2019 to 2022. Barclays and Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied future values per share of CVS Health
common stock as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2021, by applying next-twelve-months adjusted P/E multiples ranging from 11.60x
to 14.00x to next-twelve-months adjusted EPS estimates for CVS Health as a stand-alone entity for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2021, as reflected in
the CVS Health forecasts. Barclays and Goldman Sachs then calculated the implied future values per share of the common stock of the combined
company as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021, by applying next-twelve-months adjusted P/E multiples ranging from 11.60x to
15.00x to next-twelve-months adjusted EPS estimates for the combined company for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021, as reflected in the CVS
Health pro forma forecasts and the expected synergies. This range of illustrative adjusted P/E multiples was derived by Barclays and Goldman Sachs
utilizing their professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical trading data and the current adjusted P/E multiples for
CVS Health and Aetna.

Utilizing a discount rate of 7.80%, reflecting an estimate of the cost of equity for each of CVS Health and the combined company and derived by
application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally, Goldman Sachs then derived a range of implied present values per share for CVS
Health as a stand-alone entity and for the combined company by discounting to present value as of December 1, 2017, (i) the implied values per share of
CVS Health as a stand-alone entity and of the combined company and (ii) the values of the dividends per share projected to be paid by each of the
respective entities for each of the calendar years 2018 to 2021. Goldman Sachs then added the present value of the implied values per share to the
present values of the dividends to calculate the present value of the stock of each of CVS Health as a stand-alone entity and the pro forma combined
company.

The following tables present the results of the analysis of the implied present value of the illustrative future value per share of CVS Health
common stock:

page 161 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), prepared by management of CVS Health and furnished to Centerview by CVS Health for
purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are collectively referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS
Health internal data; and

 

 
•  certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by management of CVS Health to result from the transaction furnished to Centerview

by CVS Health for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the

Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of CVS Health regarding their
assessment of the Aetna internal data, the adjusted Aetna projections, the CVS Health internal data (including, without limitation, the CVS Health
management projections and the CVS Health combined company projections) and the synergies, and the strategic rationale for the transaction. In
addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for Aetna and CVS Health and
compared that data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview deemed
relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the transaction with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
certain other transactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other
information as Centerview deemed appropriate.

Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with the
consent of CVS Health, Centerview relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at the direction of
CVS Health, that the Aetna internal data was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Aetna as to the matters covered thereby and that the CVS Health internal data (including without limitation the, CVS Health
management projections and the CVS Health combined company projections), the adjusted Aetna projections and the synergies were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of CVS Health as to the matters covered thereby,
and Centerview relied, at the direction of CVS Health, on the Aetna internal data, the adjusted Aetna projections, the CVS Health internal data
(including, without limitation, the CVS Health management projections and CVS Health combined company projections) and the synergies for purposes
of Centerview’s analysis and opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the Aetna internal data, the adjusted Aetna projections, the CVS
Health internal data (including, without limitation, the CVS Health management projections and the CVS Health combined company projections), the
synergies or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, at the direction of CVS Health, Centerview did not make any independent
evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of Aetna or CVS Health, nor was
Centerview furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and Centerview was not asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the
properties or assets of Aetna or CVS Health. Centerview is not an actuary and its services did not include any actuarial determination or evaluation by
Centerview or any attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions, and Centerview relied on the actuaries of CVS Health with respect to reserve adequacy. In
that regard, Centerview made no analysis of, and expressed no opinion as to, the adequacy of the loss and loss adjustments expenses reserves, the future
policy benefit reserves, the long-term business provision and claims outstanding or the embedded value of CVS Health and Aetna. Centerview assumed,
at the direction of CVS Health, that the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any respect material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion
from the draft merger agreement reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also assumed, at the direction of CVS Health, that the transaction will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements,
without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s
analysis or Centerview’s opinion, that the representations and warranties made by Aetna and CVS Health in the merger agreement were and would be
true

taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual value of Aetna or CVS Health. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview.
Considering the data in the tables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses
or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Aetna, CVS
Health or any other parties to the transaction. None of Aetna, CVS Health, Merger Sub, Centerview or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value
of Aetna and CVS Health do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Aetna or CVS Health may actually be sold. Accordingly, the
assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before
December 1, 2017 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the transaction) and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Stand-alone Aetna Financial Analysis

Selected Comparable Public Company Analysis

Centerview reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for Aetna to corresponding financial information, ratios and
multiples for publicly traded companies in the managed care industry that Centerview deemed comparable, based on its experience and professional
judgment, to Aetna, which selected publicly traded companies are referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the selected
Aetna comparable companies. None of the companies that were selected based on these criteria were subsequently excluded in conducting this analysis.

The selected Aetna comparable companies consisted of:
 

Selected Aetna Comparable Companies
United Health
Anthem
Cigna
Humana

Although none of the selected Aetna comparable companies is directly comparable to Aetna, these companies were selected by Centerview,
among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies in the managed care industry with certain operational and financial characteristics,
which, for purposes of its analyses, Centerview considered to be similar to those of Aetna.

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, FactSet (a data source containing historical and estimated financial data),
publicly available Wall Street research and closing stock prices as of December 1, 2017, as well as the adjusted Aetna projections, Centerview
calculated, for each selected Aetna comparable company, and for Aetna (and in the case of Aetna, an unaffected calculation was also prepared based on
a market closing stock price immediately prior to October 26, 2017, the first day on which news of the potential transaction was published), the
following ratios and multiples: (1) enterprise value (calculated as the market value of common equity (determined using the fully diluted equity value)
plus the book value of debt and noncontrolling interests, less cash and cash equivalents held at the parent company) as a multiple of 2017, 2018

and 2019 calendar year estimated EBITDA, and (2) the price to earnings ratio for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 calendar years. Where applicable, the
multiples were adjusted to account for certain events such as pending acquisitions and divestitures.

The results of this analysis for the Aetna comparable companies are summarized below:
 

   Minimum   Median   Average   Maximum 
EV / 2017E EBITDA    10.5x    13.4x    13.1x    15.4x 
EV / 2018E EBITDA    10.1x    11.4x    11.4x    12.8x 
EV / 2019E EBITDA    9.1x    10.4x    10.3x    11.4x 
2017E Price / Earnings    19.4x    21.2x    21.1x    22.5x 
2018E Price / Earnings    18.0x    19.5x    19.6x    21.4x 
2019E Price / Earnings    16.3x    17.3x    17.5x    18.9x 

Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis Centerview selected an enterprise value to estimated 2018
EBITDA multiple reference range of 10.0x to 12.5x and a price to estimated 2018 earnings ratio reference range of 16.0x to 21.0x. In selecting these
reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the
business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Aetna and the selected Aetna comparable companies that could affect the public
trading values in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying these reference ranges to the adjusted
Aetna projections, Centerview calculated the following implied ranges of values per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00, of Aetna common stock:
(1) based on Aetna’s 2018 calendar year estimated adjusted EBITDA, Centerview calculated an implied range of approximately $159 to $206 per share
of Aetna common stock and, (2) based on Aetna’s 2018 calendar year estimated adjusted earnings per share, Centerview calculated an implied range of
approximately $160 to $210 per share of Aetna common stock. Centerview then compared these ranges to the value of the merger consideration of
$207.94 per share implied by the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on December 1, 2017.

Selected Transactions Analysis

Centerview analyzed certain information relating to selected transactions announced since 2000 for which publicly disclosed information is
available in the managed care industry that Centerview deemed, based on its experience, expertise and knowledge of the managed care industry, to have
operations, results, business mix or product profiles that, for purposes of analysis, are similar to certain operations, results, business mix or product
profiles of Aetna.

None of the transactions that were selected based on these criteria were subsequently excluded in conducting this analysis. The selected
transactions consisted of:

No company or transaction used in this analysis is directly comparable to Aetna or CVS Health or the transaction. The companies included in the
selected transactions are companies that were selected, among other reasons, because they have certain operational and financial characteristics that, for
the purposes of its analysis, Centerview considered to be similar to those of Aetna. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the
selected transactions analyzed were diverse, and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Aetna,
CVS Health and the companies included in the selected transactions.

The results of this analysis are summarized below:
 

   Median   Mean  
EV / LTM EBITDA Multiple    12.0x    11.3x 

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected companies, Centerview selected an enterprise value to estimated LTM
EBITDA multiple reference range of 11.0x to 13.5x. In selecting this reference range, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience
and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Aetna and the
companies included in the selected transactions and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of such companies or
Aetna. Centerview applied this reference range to Aetna’s estimated calendar year 2017 adjusted EBITDA, reflected in the adjusted Aetna projections,
to calculate an illustrative range of implied values per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00, of Aetna common stock as of December 1, 2017 of
approximately $166 to $210 per share of Aetna common stock. Centerview then compared the results of this analysis to the value of the merger
consideration of $207.94 per share implied by the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on December 1, 2017.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna, which is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an
asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows and is
obtained by discounting those future cash flows by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the
opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.

In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated the estimated present value of the unlevered free cash flows of Aetna reflected in the adjusted
Aetna projections for Q4 2017 and the years from 2018 through 2022. The terminal value of Aetna at the end of the forecast period was estimated by
using perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 3.0%. This range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Centerview utilizing its professional
judgment and experience, taking into account the adjusted Aetna projections and market expectations regarding long term real growth of gross domestic
product and inflation. The unlevered free cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 6.5%
to 7.5%. This range of discount rates was determined based on Centerview’s analysis of Aetna’s weighted average cost of capital. Based on its analysis,
Centerview calculated a range of implied values per share of Aetna common stock, rounded to the nearest $1.00, of $170 to $263 per share. Centerview
then compared the results of this analysis to the value of the merger consideration of $207.94 per share implied by the closing price of shares of CVS
Health common stock on December 1, 2017.

Centerview also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Aetna inclusive of the synergies expected by CVS Health to be realized in
connection with the transaction. In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated the estimated present value of the expected annual after-tax
synergies, net of the costs to achieve such synergies, referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as net synergies, for the period
from 2018 through 2022. The terminal value of the net synergies at the end of the forecast period was estimated by using perpetuity growth rates ranging
from 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected using the methodologies and assumptions described above. The net synergies and terminal values were
then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.5%, which range was selected using the methodologies and assumptions
described above. Based on the discounted cash flow analyses Centerview performed on Aetna and the synergies, Centerview calculated implied values
per share of Aetna common stock, including the synergies and rounded to the nearest $1.00, of $193 to $299 per share. Centerview then compared the
results of this analysis to the value of the merger consideration of $207.94 per share implied by the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock
on December 1, 2017.

Other Factors

Centerview noted for the board of directors of CVS Health certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other
things, the following:
 

 

•  Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed the stock price performance of Aetna common stock for the 52-week period
prior to December 1, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the transaction. Centerview noted that the range, rounded
to the nearest $1.00, of low and high closing prices of Aetna common stock during the prior 52-week period was $105.00 to $192.00, as
compared to the merger consideration of $207.94 per share implied by the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on
December 1, 2017. Centerview also noted that the highest closing price of Aetna common stock during the 52-week period prior to
December 1, 2017 but prior to the first day on which speculation of the transaction was published was $165. Centerview also noted that
historical trading price analysis is not a valuation methodology and that such analysis was presented for reference purposes only and not as a
component of Centerview’s fairness analyses.

 

 

•  Analyst Price Target Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for Aetna common stock reflected in publicly available Wall Street
research analyst reports. Centerview noted that the range of stock price targets in such research analyst reports prior to the first day on which
speculation of the transaction was published was between $150 and $185, and the range of stock price targets in such research analyst
reports after the day on which speculation of the transaction was published was between $165 and $200, as compared to the merger
consideration of $207.94 per share implied by the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on December 1, 2017. Centerview
also noted that analyst price targets are not a valuation methodology and that such analysis was presented for reference purposes only and
not as a component of Centerview’s fairness analyses.

Stand-alone CVS Health Financial Analysis

Selected Comparable Public Company Analysis

Centerview also reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for CVS Health to corresponding financial
information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies in the retail and pharmacy benefits management industries that Centerview deemed
comparable, based on its experience and professional judgment, to CVS Health, which selected publicly traded companies are referred to in this section
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the selected CVS Health comparable companies. None of the companies that were selected based on these
criteria were subsequently excluded in conducting this analysis.

The selected CVS Health comparable companies consisted of:
 

Selected CVS Health Comparable Companies
Walmart
Walgreens Boots Alliance
Express Scripts

Although none of the selected CVS Health comparable companies is directly comparable to CVS Health, these companies were selected, among
other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational and financial characteristics, which, for purposes of its analyses,
Centerview considered to be similar to those of CVS Health.

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings, FactSet data, publicly available Wall Street research and closing stock prices as
of December 1, 2017, Centerview calculated, for each selected CVS Health comparable company, and for CVS Health, the following ratios and
multiples: (1) enterprise value (calculated as the market value of common equity (determined using the fully diluted equity value) plus the book value of
debt and noncontrolling interests, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of 2017, 2018 and 2019 calendar year estimated EBITDA, and (2) the
price to earnings ratio for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 calendar years. Where applicable, the multiples were adjusted to account for certain events such as
pending acquisitions and divestitures.

The results of this analysis for the CVS Health comparable companies are summarized below:
 

   Minimum   Median   Average   Maximum 
EV / 2017E EBITDA    6.8x    9.3x    8.8x    10.2x 
EV / 2018E EBITDA    6.7x    8.8x    8.5x    9.9x 
EV / 2019E EBITDA    6.5x    8.5x    8.2x    9.6x 
2017E Price / Earnings    8.9x    13.2x    14.7x    22.1x 
2018E Price / Earnings    8.2x    12.4x    13.8x    20.9x 
2019E Price / Earnings    7.4x    11.4x    12.8x    19.6x 

Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis Centerview selected an enterprise value to estimated calendar year
2018 EBITDA multiple reference range of 7.5x to 9.0x and a price to estimated calendar year 2018 earnings ratio reference range of 10.0x to 15.0x. In
selecting these reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences
between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of CVS Health and the selected CVS Health comparable companies that
could affect the public trading values in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying these reference
ranges to the CVS Health management projections, Centerview calculated the following implied ranges of values per share, rounded to the nearest
$1.00, of CVS Health common stock: (1) based on CVS Health’s 2018 calendar year estimated adjusted EBITDA, Centerview calculated an implied
range of approximately $74 to $93 per share of CVS Health common stock, and, based on CVS Health’s 2018 calendar year estimated adjusted earnings
per share, Centerview calculated an implied range of approximately $63 to $95 per share of CVS Health common stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Centerview also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CVS Health.

In performing the discounted cash flow analysis, Centerview calculated the estimated present value of the unlevered free cash flows of CVS
Health reflected in the CVS Health management projections for Q4 2017 and the years from 2018 through 2022. The terminal value of CVS Health at
the end of the forecast period was estimated by using perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%. This range of perpetuity growth rates was
estimated by Centerview utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the CVS Health

management projections and market expectations regarding long term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. The unlevered free cash
flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 6.25% to 7.25%. This range of discount rates was
determined based on Centerview’s analysis of CVS Health’s weighted average cost of capital. Based on its analysis, Centerview calculated a range of
implied values per share of CVS Health common stock, rounded to the nearest $1.00, of $80 to $119 per share.

Other Factors

Centerview noted for the board of directors of CVS Health certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other
things, the following:
 

 

•  Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed the stock price performance of CVS Health common stock for the 52-week
period prior to December 1, 2017 and noted that the range, rounded to the nearest $1.00, of low and high closing prices during this period
was $66 to $85, as compared to the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on December 1, 2017 of $75.12. Centerview also
noted that historical trading price analysis is not a valuation methodology and that such analysis was presented for reference purposes only
and not as a component of Centerview’s fairness analyses.

 

 

•  Analyst Price Target Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for shares of CVS Health common stock reflected in publicly
available Wall Street research analyst reports and noted that the range of stock price targets in such research analyst reports was between $73
and $97, as compared to the closing price of shares of CVS Health common stock on December 1, 2017 of $75.12. Centerview also noted
that analyst price targets are not a valuation methodology and that such analysis was presented for reference purposes only and not as a
component of Centerview’s fairness analyses.

Relative Value Analysis

Based upon a comparison of the range of implied equity values for each of Aetna and CVS Health calculated pursuant to the selected comparable
public companies analysis and discounted cash flow analysis described above, Centerview calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios for the
transaction, on a cash adjusted basis with the Aetna equity value contribution reduced by cash consideration of $145 per share. Centerview calculated
these ratios on bases exclusive and inclusive of expected synergies resulting from the transaction. With respect to any given range of exchange ratios,
the higher ratio assumes the highest implied value per share of Aetna common stock divided by the highest implied value per share of CVS Health
common stock, and the lower ratio assumes the lowest implied value per share of Aetna common stock divided by the lowest implied value per share of
CVS Health common stock.

Centerview’s analysis indicated the following implied ranges of exchange ratios on a basis exclusive of expected synergies and on a basis
inclusive of expected synergies (based upon a present value of the near term synergies equal to $9.4 billion with 50-75% of the value of the synergies
attributed to Aetna and the remainder to CVS Health):
 

Valuation Methodology   Implied Cash Adjusted Exchange Ratio 
Without Synergies   

Selected Trading Comparables (EV / EBITDA)    0.1951x to 0.6527x 
Selected Trading Comparables (2018E Price / Earnings)    0.2395x to 0.6868x 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis    0.3162x to 0.9929x 

With Synergies   
Selected Trading Comparables (EV / EBITDA)    0.3637x to 0.8594x

Centerview compared the implied ranges of cash adjusted exchange ratios to the implied transaction exchange ratio of 0.8378 shares of CVS
Health common stock per share of Aetna common stock.

General

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or
analysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of the analyses.

Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors of CVS Health in its
evaluation of the transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the board of directors or
management of CVS Health with respect to the merger consideration or as to whether the board of directors of CVS Health would have been willing to
determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between CVS
Health and Aetna and was approved by the board of directors of CVS Health. Centerview provided advice to CVS Health during these negotiations.
Centerview did not, however recommend any specific amount of consideration to CVS Health or CVS Health’s board of directors or that any specific
amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.

Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory
and merchant banking activities. In the past two years, Centerview has not been engaged on a fee paying basis to provide financial advisory or other
services to CVS Health or Aetna, and has not received any compensation from CVS Health or Aetna during such period. As was disclosed to the CVS
Health board of directors prior to its approval of Centerview’s engagement on the transaction, Centerview has from time to time in the past two years
engaged in discussions with and provided certain advisory services to CVS Health with respect to various potential strategic alternatives. However
Centerview did not enter into any engagement letters with, or receive any compensation from, CVS Health with respect to any such matters. As was
disclosed to the CVS Health board of directors prior to its approval of Centerview’s engagement on the transaction, Centerview has from time to time in
the past two years engaged in discussions with and provided certain advisory services to Aetna with respect to various potential strategic alternatives.
However, Centerview did not enter into any engagement letters with, or receive any compensation from, Aetna with respect to any such matters.
Centerview may provide investment banking and other services to or with respect to CVS Health or Aetna or their respective affiliates in the future, for
which Centerview may receive compensation. In addition, as was disclosed to the CVS Health board of directors prior to its approval of Centerview’s
engagement on the transaction, David W. Dorman, Chairman of the Board of Directors of CVS Health, is a partner in the ultimate general partner and
the manager of Centerview Capital Technology Fund (Delaware), L.P. and Centerview Capital Technology Fund-A (Delaware), L.P., together with a
related employee fund (collectively referred to as Centerview Capital Technology in this summary of Centerview’s opinion), which are growth equity
investment funds focused on the technology sector. Certain partners of Centerview Partners LLC (including the senior member of the Centerview team
advising on the transaction) are partners (either directly or indirectly) in the ultimate general partner and the manager of Centerview Capital Technology
and serve on Centerview Capital Technology’s investment committee. Centerview Partners LLC provides certain back office support to Centerview
Capital Technology. Mr. Dorman has no ownership interest in, and is not an employee of, Centerview Partners LLC.

derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, CVS Health, Aetna or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be
involved in the transaction.

The board of directors of CVS Health selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the transaction based on Centerview’s
reputation and experience in the managed care and insurance industries. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has
substantial experience in transactions similar to the transaction.

In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to the board of directors of CVS Health, CVS Health paid Centerview an
aggregate fee of $12 million upon the rendering of Centerview’s opinion. In addition, CVS Health has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s
expenses arising, and to indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Neither CVS Health nor Aetna generally publishes its business plans and strategies or makes external disclosures of its anticipated financial
position or results of operations due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates, other than, in each case,
providing, from time to time, estimated ranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current year and certain future years
in their respective regular earnings press releases and other investor materials.

Aetna Projections

In connection with CVS Health’s evaluation of the merger, Aetna made available on October 29, 2017 to CVS Health, Goldman Sachs and
Barclays, and on December 1, 2017 to Centerview, certain financial forecasts and unaudited prospective financial information relating to Aetna on a
stand-alone basis, assuming Aetna would continue as an independent company, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Aetna management projections. The Aetna management projections also were provided to each of Lazard, Allen & Company and Evercore for their use
and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and, as applicable, opinions in connection with the merger. The Aetna board of
directors also reviewed and considered the Aetna management projections at the meetings of the Aetna board of directors on October 27, 2017,
November 14, 2017, November 20, 2017, December 1, 2017 and December 3, 2017.

The Aetna projections (as defined below) reflect numerous assumptions and estimates that Aetna made in good faith, including, without
limitation, (i) with respect to the projections of Aetna adjusted earnings per share, that Aetna, as a stand-alone company, would continue to repurchase
its common shares in the ordinary course of business; (ii) that macroeconomic conditions would remain stable, both in the U.S. and globally; (iii) that
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would not be repealed or defunded; (iv) that the interest rate environment would remain stable; (v) that
competitor pricing would remain rational; (vi) that commercial medical cost trends would be in line with recent experience; (vii) that the Medicare
Advantage and managed Medicaid rate environments would remain stable; (viii) that Medicare Advantage membership would grow in excess of
industry growth and Medicaid membership would return to growth in 2019; (ix) that consumers would continue to take on greater decision-making and
financial responsibility with respect to their health care; (x) that providers would remain receptive to partnering with Aetna on value-based contracting
to reduce the cost of care, improve quality and provide consumers with better health care experiences; (xi) that the annual premium-based health insurer
fee under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the HIF) returns in 2018 and
applies to each year thereafter; (xii) that the tax laws, including corporate tax rates, remain unchanged relative to such laws (including such rates) as in
effect on October 29, 2017; (xiii) that the sale of Aetna’s domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses
occurred; and (xiv) certain other matters referred to below under “—General” beginning on page 164 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
Aetna projections also assume that GAAP as in effect on October 29, 2017 applies throughout the projection period.

Table of Contents

The following table presents a summary of the Aetna management projections:
 
   Year Ending December 31,  
   2017P    2018P    2019P    2020P    2021P    2022P  
   (dollars in billions, except for per share amounts)  
Aetna adjusted revenue (1)   $60.5   $ 60.7   $ 67.3   $ 73.7   $ 80.4   $ 87.8 
Aetna adjusted earnings (2)    3.3    3.1    3.4    3.6    3.9    4.2 
Aetna adjusted earnings per share (3)    9.84    10.01    11.13    12.38    13.85    15.36 
 
(1) Aetna adjusted revenue means total revenue excluding net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary

course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance. Projected full-year 2017 Aetna adjusted revenue excludes from
total revenue interest income on the proceeds of Aetna’s June 2016 debt financing of $11 million pre-tax and net realized capital losses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $262 million pre-tax. The interest income on the proceeds of Aetna’s June 2016 debt financing was
excluded from total revenue because it neither relates to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflects Aetna’s underlying business
performance. Net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of
assets that support the payment of liabilities. However, these transactions do not directly relate to the underwriting or servicing of products for
customers and are not directly related to the core performance of Aetna’s business operations. Aetna will experience net realized capital gains or
net realized capital losses subsequent to September 30, 2017, however Aetna cannot project the amount of such future gains or losses. Therefore,
Aetna has assumed no net realized capital gains or losses after September 30, 2017 for purposes of projecting total revenue, net income
attributable to Aetna, which is referred to in this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus as net income, and income before income taxes
for the years ending December 31, 2017 to 2022. Aetna’s annual net realized capital gains or losses ranged from a net realized capital loss of
$65 million to a net realized capital gain of $86 million during calendar years 2014 through 2016.

(2) Aetna adjusted earnings means net income, excluding amortization of other acquired intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and
other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance. Projected
full-year 2017 Aetna adjusted earnings exclude from projected full-year 2017 net income the loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of
$246 million pre-tax, projected guaranty fund assessments related to the insolvency of Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one
of its affiliates, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the projected Penn Treaty-related guaranty fund assessments, of
$231 million pre-tax, transaction and integration-related costs (including termination costs) primarily related to the Humana transaction of
$1.2 billion pre-tax, the reduction of Aetna’s reserve for anticipated future losses on discontinued products of $(109) million pre-tax, estimated
amortization of other acquired intangible assets of approximately $230 million pre-tax, net realized capital losses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 of $262 million pre-tax, other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s
underlying business performance and the corresponding income tax benefit related to the items excluded from net income discussed above of
approximately $(800) million. Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that Aetna adjusted earnings and Aetna adjusted
earnings per share provide a more useful comparison of Aetna’s underlying business performance from period to period. Amortization of other
acquired intangible assets relates to Aetna’s acquisition activities, however this amortization does not directly relate to the underwriting or
servicing of products for customers and is not directly related to the core performance of Aetna’s business operations. Refer to note (1) above for a
discussion of net realized capital gains and losses.

(3) Aetna adjusted earnings per share means (i) Aetna adjusted earnings, as described in note (2) above, divided by (ii) the projected number of
weighted average diluted Aetna common shares. Projected full-year 2017 net income per share and Aetna adjusted earnings per share reflect a
range of 334 million to 335 million weighted average diluted Aetna common shares.

Each of Aetna adjusted revenue, Aetna adjusted earnings and Aetna adjusted earnings per share, as presented above in the Aetna management
projections, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial

measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. Aetna
prepared this information as part of its ordinary course internal business and strategic planning process, and not for external disclosure. Aetna cannot
project either the amount of any other items excluded from net income or total revenue for the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022 or the
amount of future net realized capital gains or losses; therefore Aetna cannot reconcile Aetna adjusted revenue, Aetna adjusted earnings or Aetna
adjusted earnings per share to the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for any of
those periods. Projected amortization of other acquired intangible assets is approximately $200 million, $190 million, $180 million, $155 million and
$155 million pre-tax, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022.

Certain other unaudited prospective financial information relating to Aetna on a stand-alone basis, assuming Aetna would continue as an
independent company, was calculated based on the Aetna management projections and provided to each of Lazard, Allen & Company and Evercore for
their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and, as applicable, opinions in connection with the merger, including, in the
case of the following unlevered free cash flow estimates, Lazard’s and Allen & Company’s respective discounted cash flow analyses as described under
“—Opinions of Aetna’s Financial Advisors—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC—Aetna Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” and
“—Opinions of Aetna’s Financial Advisors—Opinion of Allen & Company LLC—Aetna Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”
beginning on pages 114 and 123, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This information is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the supplemental Aetna projections, and together with the Aetna management projections, the Aetna projections. The Aetna
board of directors reviewed and considered the supplemental Aetna projections at the meetings of the Aetna board of directors on October 27, 2017,
November 14, 2017, November 20, 2017, December 1, 2017 and December 3, 2017. On October 29, 2017, Aetna made available to CVS Health,
Goldman Sachs and Barclays the supplemental Aetna projections.

The following table presents a summary of the supplemental Aetna projections:
 
   Year Ending December 31,  
   2017P   2018P   2019P   2020P   2021P   2022P 
   (dollars in billions)  
Aetna adjusted EBITDA (1)   $ 5.9   $ 6.2   $ 6.6   $ 7.1   $ 7.7   $ 8.3 
Aetna unlevered free cash flow (2)    3.4    3.5    2.8    2.5    2.8    3.0 
 
(1) Aetna adjusted EBITDA means income before income taxes, excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, net realized capital gains

or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance.
(2) Aetna unlevered free cash flow means net income, excluding: (i) net realized capital gains or losses, (ii) other items, if any, that neither relate to

the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance as described above, (iii) the corresponding income tax
benefit or expense related to net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s
business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance that are excluded from net income as described above; less (I) risk based capital
contributions (distributions), (II) changes in Aetna Inc.’s working capital, (III) after-tax pension plan contributions, (IV) after-tax debt retirement
premiums, (V) acquisitions and investments and (VI) after-tax Humana related termination fees; plus (a) after-tax net interest, (b) other net cash
flow adjustments and (c) capital projected to be released due to the sale of Aetna’s domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and
absence management businesses.

Each of Aetna adjusted EBITDA and Aetna unlevered free cash flow, as presented above in the supplemental Aetna projections, is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated
in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the description above for a discussion of net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate
to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance that were excluded from the relevant GAAP metric.

Projected full-year 2017 Aetna adjusted EBITDA excludes from projected full-year 2017 income before income taxes the loss on early
extinguishment of long-term debt of $246 million pre-tax, the projected Penn Treaty-related guaranty fund assessments of $231 million pre-tax,
transaction and integration-related costs (including termination costs) primarily related to the Humana transaction of $1.2 billion pre-tax, the reduction
of Aetna’s reserve for anticipated future losses on discontinued products of $(109) million pre-tax, net realized capital losses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 of $262 million pre-tax, other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s
underlying business performance, projected interest expense of approximately $360 million pre-tax and projected depreciation and amortization expense
of approximately $655 million pre-tax. Projected interest expense is approximately $360 million, $380 million, $400 million, $420 million and
$470 million pre-tax, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022. Projected depreciation and amortization is approximately
$610 million, $630 million, $635 million, $630 million and $650 million pre-tax, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022.
Aetna cannot project either the amount of any other items excluded from income before income taxes for the years ending December 31, 2018 through
2022 or the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses; therefore Aetna cannot reconcile Aetna adjusted EBITDA to the most directly
comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for any of those periods.

Projected full-year 2017 Aetna unlevered free cash flow excludes from projected full-year 2017 net income the loss on early extinguishment of
long-term debt of $246 million pre-tax, the projected Penn Treaty-related guaranty fund assessments of $231 million pre-tax, transaction and
integration-related costs (including termination costs) primarily related to the Humana transaction of $1.2 billion pre-tax, the reduction of Aetna’s
reserve for anticipated future losses on discontinued products of $(109) million pre-tax, net realized capital losses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 of $262 million pre-tax, other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s
underlying business performance, the corresponding income tax benefit related to net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither
relate to the ordinary course of Aetna’s business nor reflect Aetna’s underlying business performance that are excluded from net income of
approximately $(700) million; less risk based capital contributions of approximately $60 million, changes in Aetna Inc.’s working capital of
approximately $(60) million, after-tax debt retirement premiums of approximately $(95) million, acquisitions and investments of approximately $(30)
million and after-tax Humana related termination fees of approximately $(660) million; plus after-tax net interest of approximately $230 million, other
net cash flow adjustments of approximately $(215) million and capital projected to be released due to the sale of Aetna’s domestic group life insurance,
group disability insurance and absence management businesses of approximately $975 million. Projected risk based capital contributions are
approximately $(15) million, $(1.1) billion, $(1.1) billion, $(1.1) billion and $(1.2) billion, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2018 through
2022. Projected changes in Aetna Inc.’s working capital are approximately $(50) million for each of the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022.
Projected after-tax pension plan contributions are approximately $(40) million for each of the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022. Projected
after-tax net interest is approximately $235 million, $250 million, $260 million, $270 million and $310 million, respectively, for the years ending
December 31, 2018 through 2022. Projected other net cash flow adjustments are approximately $(15) million, $190 million, $(80) million, $(100)
million and $(120) million, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022. Capital projected to be released due to the sale of
Aetna’s domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses is approximately $400 million for each of the
years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019. Aetna cannot project either the amount of any other items excluded from net income for the years ending
December 31, 2018 through 2022 or the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses; therefore Aetna cannot reconcile Aetna unlevered free cash
flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for any of those periods.

this joint proxy statement/prospectus), CVS Health made certain adjustments to the assumptions and estimates underlying the Aetna projections in light
of, among other things, the due diligence CVS Health conducted on Aetna, the potential impact of the transaction pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement and other effects of the transaction, and certain macroeconomic and industry trends. CVS Health’s adjusted version of the Aetna projections
are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the adjusted Aetna projections. The adjusted Aetna projections were made available by CVS
Health to each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions. CVS Health directed each
of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview to use and rely upon (and each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview accordingly used and relied
upon) the adjusted Aetna projections for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions (see “—Opinions of CVS Health’s Financial
Advisors” beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus). The CVS Health board of directors also reviewed and considered the
adjusted Aetna projections in connection with its review of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective financial analyses at the meeting of the CVS
Health board of directors held on November 30, 2017 and Barclays’, Goldman Sachs’ and Centerview’s respective financial analyses and opinions at the
meeting of the CVS Health board of directors held on December 3, 2017.

The following table presents a summary of the adjusted Aetna projections. While the adjusted Aetna projections reflect certain adjustments made
by CVS Health’s management to the assumptions and estimates underlying the Aetna projections, the aggregate effect of these adjustments to such
projections was not significant.

(1) Each of Aetna adjusted revenue, Aetna adjusted earnings, Aetna adjusted EBITDA and Aetna unlevered free cash flow has the meaning set forth

above under “—Aetna Projections” beginning on page 155 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. As further described above (see “—Aetna
Projections” beginning on page 155 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), Aetna adjusted revenue, Aetna adjusted earnings, Aetna adjusted
EBITDA and Aetna unlevered free cash flow, as presented above in the adjusted Aetna projections, are each a non-GAAP financial measure. As
further described above, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or
calculated in accordance with GAAP, and these measures cannot be reconciled to the respective most directly comparable financial measure
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for any of the periods presented.

The adjusted Aetna projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus only
because such information was made available, in whole or in part, to Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview for purposes of their respective financial
analyses and opinions (see “—Opinions of CVS Health’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus).

CVS Health Management Projections

In connection with Aetna’s evaluation of the merger, CVS Health made available to each of Aetna, Lazard, Allen & Company and Evercore
certain financial forecasts and unaudited prospective financial information relating to CVS Health for the years ending December 31, 2017 through
December 31, 2021 prepared by CVS Health management on a stand-alone basis, assuming CVS Health would continue as an independent company,
without giving effect to the merger, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health management projections. The CVS
Health management projections for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022 were provided to each of Barclays, Goldman
Sachs and Centerview for

purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions (see “—Opinions of CVS Health’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 128 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus). CVS Health directed each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview to use and rely upon (and each of Barclays,
Goldman Sachs and Centerview accordingly used and relied upon) the CVS Health management projections for purposes of their respective financial
analyses and opinions. The CVS Health board of directors also reviewed and considered the CVS Health management projections at the meetings of the
CVS Health board of directors held on November 30, 2017 and December 3, 2017.

The CVS Health management projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates that CVS Health made in good faith, including, without
limitation, (i) that macroeconomic conditions will remain stable, both in the U.S. and globally; (ii) that no major changes occur in U.S. policy, laws and
regulations, including reform of the United States health care system and tax laws; (iii) that gross margins in the pharmacy benefit management, retail
pharmacy and long-term care pharmacy industries remain stable; (iv) that no new regulatory and business changes occur relating to CVS Health’s
participation in Medicare Part D; (v) that no major changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally occur, (vi) that reimbursement
pressure does not accelerate significantly; (vii) that the sale of CVS Health’s RxCrossroads business occurred and (viii) certain other matters referred to
below under “—General” beginning on page 164 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The CVS Health management projections also assume that
GAAP as in effect on November 7, 2017 applies throughout the projection period.

The following table presents a summary of the CVS Health management projections:
 
   Year Ending December 31,

(1) The CVS Health management projections for 2022 were provided to each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview for purposes of their

respective financial analyses and opinions. The CVS Health management projections for 2022 were not provided to Aetna, Lazard, Allen &
Company or Evercore. Accordingly, the CVS Health management projections, as such term is used in the section below entitled “—Calculated
CVS Health Projections” beginning on page 162 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, do not include the prospective financial information set
forth under the column labeled 2022P in the table above.

(2) CVS Health adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before income tax provision, interest, depreciation and
amortization (excluding the impact, when applicable, of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, charges in connection with store
rationalization, goodwill impairments, losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans and other items, if any, that neither relate to the
ordinary course of CVS Health’s business nor reflect CVS Health’s underlying business performance).

(3) CVS Health adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as income from continuing operations (excluding the impact, when
applicable, of the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, charges in connection with store
rationalization, goodwill impairments, losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans and other items, if any, that neither relate to the
ordinary course of CVS Health’s business nor reflect CVS Health’s underlying business performance).

(4) The respective financial analyses and opinions (see “—Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”
beginning on pages 128 and 132, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) of Barclays and Goldman Sachs utilized certain further
adjustments to the CVS Health management projections set forth in the table above related to the sale of RxCrossroads, which further adjustments
were approved by management of CVS Health. These further adjustments had the impact of

reducing CVS Health adjusted earnings per share by $0.02 per share for each of the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022. Accordingly,
the CVS Health management projections for the sections entitled “—Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.
LLC” beginning on pages 128 and 132, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, utilize such further adjustments.

(5) CVS Health adjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as (i) CVS Health adjusted net income as described in note (3)
above, divided by (ii) the projected number of weighted average diluted shares of CVS Health common stock.

CVS Health adjusted EBITDA, CVS Health adjusted net income and CVS Health adjusted earnings per share, as presented above, are each a
non-GAAP financial measure. This information was not prepared for public disclosure. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a
substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as
presented by CVS Health may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In the view of CVS Health’s management,
the CVS Health management projections were prepared on a reasonable basis based on the information available to CVS Health’s management at the
time of their preparation.

CVS Health Combined Company Projections

In connection with its evaluation of the merger, CVS Health management made available to Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview certain
financial forecasts and unaudited prospective financial information relating to CVS Health and Aetna as a combined company, giving effect to the
merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health combined company projections. The CVS Health combined
company projections were provided to each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview for purposes of their respective financial analyses and
opinions. CVS Health directed each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Centerview to use and rely upon (and each of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and
Centerview accordingly used and relied upon) the CVS Health combined company projections for purposes of their respective financial analyses and
opinions (see “—Opinions of CVS Health’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 128 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus). The CVS Health
board of directors also reviewed and considered the CVS Health combined company projections at the meetings of the CVS Health board of directors
held on November 30, 2017 and December 3, 2017.

The CVS Health combined company projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates that CVS Health made in good faith in connection
with the preparation of the adjusted Aetna projections and the CVS Health management projections as more fully described in “—Adjusted Aetna
Projections” and “—CVS Health Management Projections” beginning on pages 158 and 159, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Additionally, the CVS Health combined company projections reflect estimated synergies of $750 million by the second full year following completion
of the merger (which is assumed to be completed in the second half of 2018 for purposes of calculating the estimated synergies), which increase by 5%
per year thereafter.

The following table presents a summary of the CVS Health combined company projections:
 
   Year Ending December 31,  
   2018P    2019P    2020P    2021P    2022P

CVS Health combined company adjusted net income (4)    —      9.0    10.1    10.9    11.6 
 
(1) Does not include any intercompany revenue eliminations between CVS Health and Aetna.
(2) CVS Health combined company net revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the combination of CVS Health net revenue, a GAAP

measure, with Aetna adjusted revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure defined above under “—Aetna Projections” beginning on page 155 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

(3) CVS Health combined company adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before income tax provision, interest,
depreciation and amortization (excluding the impact, when applicable, of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, charges in
connection with store rationalization, goodwill impairments, losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans, net realized capital gains or
losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the combined company’s business nor reflect the combined company’s
underlying business performance). CVS Health combined company adjusted EBITDA reflects the estimated synergies of $750 million by the
second full year following completion of the merger (which is assumed to be completed in the second half of 2018 for purposes of calculating the
estimated synergies), which increase by 5% per year thereafter.

(4) CVS Health combined company adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as income from continuing operations (excluding
the impact, when applicable, of the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, charges in connection
with store rationalization, goodwill impairments, losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans, net realized capital gains or losses and
other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the combined company’s business nor reflect the combined company’s underlying
business performance). CVS Health combined company adjusted net income reflects the estimated synergies of $750 million by the second full
year following completion of the merger (which is assumed to be completed in the second half of 2018 for purposes of calculating the estimated
synergies), which increase by 5% per year thereafter.

CVS Health combined company net revenue, CVS Health combined company adjusted EBITDA and CVS Health combined company adjusted
net income, as presented above, are each a non-GAAP financial measure. This information was prepared for use by CVS Health and Barclays, Goldman
Sachs and Centerview for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions and not for public disclosure. Net realized capital gains and losses
arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of liabilities. However, these
transactions do not directly relate to the core performance of CVS Health’s business operations. CVS Health is not able to project the amount of future
net realized capital gains or losses or any other items excluded from CVS Health combined company net revenue, CVS Health combined company
adjusted EBITDA or CVS Health combined company adjusted net income as defined in the immediately preceding notes (2), (3) and (4), respectively
(other than estimated amortization of other acquired intangible assets and projected transaction and integration-related costs), and CVS Health therefore
cannot reconcile CVS Health combined company net revenue, CVS Health combined company adjusted EBITDA or CVS Health combined company
adjusted net income to the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by CVS Health may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies. In the view of CVS Health’s management, the CVS Health combined company projections were prepared on a reasonable basis based on the
information available to CVS Health’s management at the time of their preparation.

Calculated CVS Health Projections

Certain other unaudited prospective financial information relating to CVS Health on a stand-alone basis, assuming CVS Health would continue as
an independent company, was calculated by Aetna, based on the CVS Health management projections, and provided to each of Lazard, Allen &
Company and Evercore for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and, as applicable, opinions, in connection with
the merger, including Lazard’s and Allen & Company’s respective discounted cash flow analyses as described under “—Opinions of Aetna’s Financial
Advisors—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC—CVS Health Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” and “—Opinions of Aetna’s
Financial Advisors—Opinion of Allen & Company LLC—CVS Health Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” beginning on pages 116
and 126, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This information is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the calculated
CVS Health projections and, together with the CVS Health management projections, the CVS Health projections. The Aetna board of directors reviewed

beginning on page 159 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, less unlevered cash taxes, plus/minus change in working capital, less capital
expenditures, plus sale-leaseback proceeds.

CVS Health unlevered free cash flow, as presented above in the calculated CVS Health projections, is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with
GAAP, and this measure cannot be reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for
any of the periods presented.

Extrapolated CVS Health Projections

As described in “—CVS Health Management Projections” beginning on page 159 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and “—Calculated CVS
Health Projections” beginning on page 162 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the CVS Health projections provided to Aetna, Lazard, Allen &
Company and Evercore included projections only for years 2017 through 2021. In connection with its evaluation of the merger, Aetna extrapolated from
the CVS Health projections, with reference to Wall Street research, an additional year of projections for CVS Health, referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the extrapolated CVS Health projections. Aetna directed each of Lazard, Allen & Company and Evercore to use and rely upon
the extrapolated CVS Health projections for purposes of their respective financial analyses and, as applicable, opinions, in connection with the merger
(see “—Opinions of Aetna’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 111 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus). The Aetna board of directors also
reviewed and considered the extrapolated CVS Health projections at the meetings of the Aetna board of directors on November 14, 2017, December 1,

As further described above (see “—CVS Health Management Projections” and “—Calculated CVS Health Projections” beginning on pages 159
and 162, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), CVS Health adjusted earnings per share, CVS Health adjusted EBITDA and CVS
Health unlevered free cash flow, as presented above in the extrapolated CVS Health projections, are each a non-GAAP financial measure. As further
described above, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in
accordance with GAAP, and these measures cannot be reconciled to the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented
in accordance with GAAP for any of the periods presented.

General

The summaries of the parties’ respective projections included above are provided to give CVS Health’s stockholders and Aetna’s shareholders
access to certain non-public information that was made available to CVS Health, Aetna and their respective boards of directors and financial advisors in
connection with the parties’ evaluation of the merger. The parties’ projections were, in general, prepared solely for internal use and are subjective in
many respects and thus subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the parties’ projections reflect numerous assumptions and
estimates that the parties preparing such projections made in good faith at the time such projections were prepared with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to the applicable party. These
assumptions are inherently uncertain, were made as of the date the parties’ projections were prepared, and may not be reflective of actual results, either
since the date such projections were prepared, now or in the future, in light of changed circumstances, economic conditions, or other developments.
Some or all of the assumptions that have been made regarding, among other things, the timing of certain occurrences or impacts, may have changed
since the date the parties’ projections were prepared. For example, in December 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (which is referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the TCJA) became effective, and in January 2018 the HIF was suspended for 2019. The parties’ projections were
based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of CVS Health or Aetna, as applicable.

Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the parties’ projections not to be achieved include risks and uncertainties relating to CVS
Health’s and Aetna’s businesses (including their abilities to achieve their respective strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods;
industry conditions; the regulatory environment; general business and economic conditions; and other factors described under “Risk Factors” and
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on pages 62 and 72, respectively, of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as
well as the risk factors with respect to CVS Health’s and Aetna’s respective businesses contained in their most recent SEC filings, which readers are
urged to review, which may be found as described under “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus). In addition, the parties’ projections cover multiple future years, and such information by its nature is less reliable in predicting
each successive year. The parties’ projections also do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were
prepared, and do not give effect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, except that, as described above, the
CVS Health combined company projections give effect to the completion of the merger. For example, the parties’ projections do not take into account
the TCJA or the suspension of the HIF for 2019. The parties’ projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to
change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the parties’ projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
parties’ projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower than projected.

The parties’ projections were not prepared with a view toward complying with GAAP (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures
as discussed above), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither CVS Health’s nor Aetna’s independent

registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to either
party’s projections, nor has any of them expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on either party’s projections or the achievability of the
results reflected in either party’s projections, and none of them assumes any responsibility for, and each of them disclaims any association with, either
party’s projections. The reports of CVS Health’s and Aetna’s independent registered public accounting firms incorporated by reference into this joint
proxy statement/prospectus relate to CVS Health’s and Aetna’s historical financial information, respectively, and no such report extends to either party’s
projections or should be read to do so.

The inclusion of the parties’ respective projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that
any of CVS Health, Aetna or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, advisors or other representatives considered either
party’s projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the parties’ respective projections should not be relied on as such. None of CVS
Health, Aetna or their respective affiliates, officers, employees, directors, advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance that
actual results will not differ from the parties’ respective projections, and none of CVS Health, Aetna or their respective affiliates, officers,
employees or directors undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile either party’s projections to reflect circumstances
existing after the date the parties’ respective projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any
or all of the assumptions underlying the parties’ respective projections are not realized. Neither CVS Health nor Aetna intends to publicly
update or make any other revision to either party’s projections. None of CVS Health, Aetna or any of their respective affiliates, officers,
employees, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any CVS Health stockholder, Aetna
shareholder or any other person regarding CVS Health’s or Aetna’s ultimate performance compared to either party’s projections or that the
results reflected therein will be achieved. Neither CVS Health nor Aetna has made any representation to the other, in the merger agreement or
otherwise, concerning the parties’ respective projections. For the reasons described above, readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on either party’s projections.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

General

CVS Health and Aetna have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to complete the
merger, which reasonable best efforts include contesting any proceeding brought by a governmental authority seeking to prohibit completion of the
merger or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection with the merger. In using its reasonable best efforts, under the terms of
the merger agreement, CVS Health is required to take all actions and do all things necessary, proper or advisable to complete the merger in connection
with (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the merger under the HSR Act, (ii) any other antitrust law or (iii) the required
governmental authorizations, except that CVS Health is not required to take any action or agree to any term, condition or limitation in connection with
those matters if that action, term, condition or limitation would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or on Aetna. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on
page 181 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,
(x) neither CVS Health nor Aetna is required to take any action that is not conditioned upon completion of the merger and (y) Aetna is not permitted to
take any action or agree to any term or condition without CVS Health’s consent.

The obligation of each of CVS Health, Aetna and Merger Sub to effect the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or early
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the required governmental authorizations having been made or obtained and being
in full force and effect. See

“The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 181 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and Other U.S. Antitrust Authorities

Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period requirements have expired or
been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. A
transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of
their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The merger is being reviewed by the DOJ. If the DOJ issues
a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second
30-calendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the request for additional
information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier.

Each of CVS Health and Aetna filed its respective HSR Act notification and report with respect to the merger on January 2, 2018. On February 1,
2018, CVS Health and Aetna each received a request for additional information, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
second request, from the DOJ in connection with the DOJ’s review of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Issuance of the second
request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both CVS Health and Aetna have substantially complied with the second
request or such later time as the parties may agree with the DOJ, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ. CVS Health and Aetna have
been cooperating with the DOJ staff since shortly after the announcement of the merger agreement and are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ staff in
its review of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

At any time before or after the merger is completed, the DOJ could take action under the antitrust laws in opposition to the merger, including
seeking to enjoin completion of the merger, condition approval of the merger upon the divestiture of assets of CVS Health, Aetna or their respective
subsidiaries or impose restrictions on CVS Health’s post-merger operations. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take such action under the
antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin completion of the merger or
permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
some circumstances.

Federal, State and Foreign Regulatory Approvals

Pursuant to federal health care laws and regulations and, in some instances, the health care and insurance laws and regulations of certain states,
and pursuant to certain licenses and contracts of certain of Aetna’s subsidiaries, applicable federal and state regulatory and governmental authorities
must approve, or be notified of, CVS Health’s acquisition of control of Aetna’s health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, pharmacy
businesses and other regulated businesses or entities. To obtain these approvals and provide such notices, CVS Health, or the applicable CVS Health
subsidiary, and in some instances Aetna, or the applicable Aetna regulated entity, as the case may be, has filed and/or will file acquisition of control
and/or material modification or other statements, notices or applications, as required by federal health care law or regulation and the insurance and
health care laws and regulations of each applicable state and country or the Aetna regulated entities’ licenses and contracts. In addition, certain non-U.S.
governmental authorities must approve, or be notified of, the merger, and CVS Health and/or Aetna and/or their respective subsidiaries will file all such
statements, notices, or applications, as are required by the laws of applicable non-U.S. governmental authorities.

Other Governmental Approvals

Neither CVS Health nor Aetna is aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required for completion of the merger other
than those described above. It is presently contemplated that if any such additional material governmental approvals or actions are required, those
approvals or actions will be sought.

Timing; Challenges by Governmental and Other Entities

There can be no assurance that any of the regulatory approvals described above will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to
the timing of any approvals, the ability to obtain the approvals on

satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging such approvals. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or
other entities described above, including the DOJ, U.S. state attorneys general, state insurance regulators and private parties, will not challenge the
merger on antitrust or competition grounds and, if such a challenge is made, there can be no assurance as to its result.

Subject to certain conditions, if the merger is not completed on or before the end date, either CVS Health or Aetna may terminate the merger
agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 203 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

No Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights for Aetna Shareholders

Pursuant to Section 1571(b) of the PBCL, Aetna shareholders will not be entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

General

The following summary discusses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Aetna common shares. This
discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Code,
applicable Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, administrative interpretations, and judicial decisions as in effect as of the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect.

This discussion addresses only the consequences of the exchange of Aetna common shares held as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). It does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important
to an Aetna shareholder in light of the Aetna shareholder’s particular circumstances, or to an Aetna shareholder that is subject to special rules, such as:
 

 •  a financial institution or insurance company;
 

 •  a tax-exempt organization;
 

 •  a dealer or broker in securities;
 

 •  a person whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 •  a former citizen or former long-term resident of the United States;
 

 •  a real estate investment trust;
 

 •  an Aetna shareholder that holds its Aetna common shares through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;
 

 
•  an Aetna shareholder that holds Aetna common shares as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle, or conversion or integrated

transaction; or
 

 
•  an Aetna shareholder that acquired Aetna common shares through the exercise of compensatory options or stock purchase plans or otherwise

as compensation.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Aetna common shares that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state therein or

the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

Table of Contents

 
•  a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the substantial decisions of which are

controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S.
person.

A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Aetna common shares that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Aetna common shares,
the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. A partner of a partnership holding Aetna common shares should consult its tax advisors.

This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. This discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In
addition, it does not address any alternative minimum tax, any non-income tax or any non-U.S., state or local tax consequences of the merger or the
potential application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. Accordingly, each Aetna shareholder should consult its tax advisor
to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the merger.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders

The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. holders pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder will recognize taxable capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between (i) the sum of (x) the amount of cash, including cash received in lieu of fractional shares, received in the merger, and (y) the fair market value
of the shares of CVS Health common stock received in the merger and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Aetna common shares exchanged
therefor.

If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the Aetna common shares surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger, the
capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally
subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in connection with the merger is subject to
limitations under the Code. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Aetna common shares at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder
must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Aetna common shares that it holds.

A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in CVS Health common stock received in the merger will equal the fair market value of the CVS Health
common stock as of the date of the merger. The holding period of the CVS Health common stock received in the merger will begin on the day after the
merger.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to non-U.S. Holders

The receipt of the merger consideration by a non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 
•  the gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United

States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United
States);

 

 
•  the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain

other conditions are met; or

Table of Contents

 

•  the non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of the Aetna common shares at
any time during the five-year period preceding the merger, and Aetna is or has been a “U.S. real property holding corporation” within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period
preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held the Aetna common shares.

Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax on a net income basis in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S.
holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise). Additionally, any gain described in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. holder
that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty).
A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate provided by an applicable income
tax treaty) on any capital gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year. If the third bullet point
above applies to a non-U.S. holder, capital gain recognized by such holder will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates.
Aetna believes that it has not been a “U.S. real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year
period preceding the merger.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

Payments made in exchange for Aetna common shares (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) pursuant to the merger may be subject,
under certain circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder
that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return an IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder
is a “United States person” (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not
subject to backup withholding.

A non-U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) on the merger consideration
(including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) received in exchange for Aetna common shares unless the non-U.S. Holder establishes an exemption,
for example, by completing the appropriate IRS Form W-8 for the non-U.S. holder, in accordance with the instructions thereto.

Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. federal income tax liability of an
Aetna shareholder, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. The IRS may impose a penalty upon an Aetna shareholder that fails
to provide the correct taxpayer identification number.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of a business. CVS Health will record assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Aetna
primarily at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described under Note 4. Estimate of
Consideration Expected to be Transferred under “CVS Health and Aetna Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning
on page 49 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.

The financial condition and results of operations of CVS Health after completion of the merger will reflect Aetna’s balances and results after
completion of the merger but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or results of operations of Aetna. The earnings
of CVS Health following completion of the merger will reflect acquisition accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value
for assets and liabilities on interest expense and amortization expense. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized
but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all assets

Table of Contents

including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, CVS Health determines that tangible or intangible
assets (including goodwill) are impaired, CVS Health will record an impairment charge at that time.

Listing of CVS Health Common Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of Aetna Common Shares

Application will be made to have the shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued in the merger approved for listing on the NYSE, where
shares of CVS Health common stock are currently traded. If the merger is completed, Aetna common shares will no longer be listed on the NYSE and
will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Description of Debt Financing

Overview

In connection with the merger, CVS Health has entered into a bridge facility commitment letter with the initial bridge commitment parties and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (solely in its capacity as an arranger) pursuant to which the initial bridge commitment parties have
agreed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $49.0 billion. A copy of the bridge facility
commitment letter is filed as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CVS Health on December 5, 2017, which is incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the bridge facility commitment letter in its entirety. On December 15, 2017, CVS Health, the initial bridge
commitment parties and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated entered into the bridge joinder agreement with the additional bridge
commitment parties. The bridge joinder agreement amends the bridge facility commitment letter and reallocates the commitments of the initial bridge
commitment parties to fund loans under the bridge facility among the initial bridge commitment parties and the additional bridge commitment parties. A
copy of the bridge joinder agreement is filed as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CVS Health on December 19, 2017, which is
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the bridge joinder agreement in its entirety. The bridge
commitment parties’ obligation to fund the bridge facility is subject to several limited conditions as set forth in the bridge facility commitment letter,
including, among others, completion of the merger, the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the bridge facility commitment letter)
on Aetna, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to both CVS Health and Aetna, the absence of certain
defaults by CVS Health, the delivery of certain financial statements of CVS Health and Aetna and other customary conditions to completion.

In connection with the merger, CVS Health also has entered into the term loan agreement with the term lenders pursuant to which the term lenders
have agreed to provide a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion consisting of a $3.0 billion three-year
tranche and a $2.0 billion five-year tranche. A copy of the term loan agreement is filed as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CVS
Health on December 19, 2017, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the term loan agreement in its entirety.

In connection with the merger, CVS Health also has entered into a first amendment to each of its revolving credit agreements with the revolving
lenders pursuant to which the revolving lenders have agreed to (w) amend the net tangible assets test included in the covenant restricting the incurrence
of debt by CVS Health’s subsidiaries by (a) excluding any Aetna existing indebtedness from indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with
the net tangible assets test, and (b) restricting the indebtedness that may be incurred by all of CVS Health’s subsidiaries (excluding the Aetna existing
indebtedness and other indebtedness under capital leases incurred in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction) to an amount not exceeding
$900.0 million in the

aggregate, in each case, on and following completion of the merger until the date that CVS Health is in compliance with the net tangible assets test
without giving effect to the exclusion set forth in clause (a) above, (x) expressly permit completion of the merger under the acquisition covenant,
(y) amend the financial covenant by (a) increasing the consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio from 0.60:1.00 to 0.65:1.00 from
completion of the merger through and including the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, and (b) excluding unsecured indebtedness in an aggregate
principal amount not exceeding $49.0 billion incurred by CVS Health for the purpose of financing the merger (including all of the transaction costs,
fees, commissions and expenses in connection therewith) and which is redeemable or prepayable if the merger is not consummated, from the calculation
of consolidated indebtedness and total capitalization, until the earliest of the occurrence of completion of the merger, the date that is 30 days following
the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and August 31, 2019, and (z) increase the threshold amount of specified events of
default to (a) prior to the later of (i) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility commitment letter in accordance with its terms and (ii) the
termination or other expiration of the bridge facility if it is entered into, $250.0 million, and (b) at all other times, $200.0 million. Copies of the first
amendments to the revolving credit agreements are filed as exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CVS Health on December 19, 2017,
which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A summary of the terms of the revolving credit agreements may be found
in CVS Health’s Current Reports on Form 10-Q filed on August 5, 2014, August 4, 2015 and August 8, 2017, which summary is incorporated herein by
reference. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the
revolving credit agreements, as amended by their respective first amendments, in their entirety.

Bridge Loan

Pursuant to the terms of the bridge facility commitment letter, the proceeds of the loans under the bridge facility will be available upon the
satisfaction of several limited conditions precedent on completion of the merger and, if drawn, will be used to finance, in part, the cash component of the
merger consideration and to pay fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the merger. The loans under the bridge facility will mature
on the 364th day after funding thereof.

Conditions Precedent

The bridge commitment parties’ obligation to fund the loans under the bridge facility is subject to several limited conditions, including completion
of the merger, the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect (as such term is defined in the bridge facility commitment letter) on Aetna, the accuracy in
all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to both CVS Health and Aetna, the absence of certain defaults by CVS Health, the
delivery of certain financial statements of CVS Health and Aetna and other customary conditions to completion more fully set forth in the bridge facility
commitment letter.

Interest

At the option of CVS Health, borrowings under the bridge facility will bear interest at either a base rate or at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate,
plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin will range initially from 0.00-0.75% with respect to base rate borrowings, and
0.875-1.75% with respect to the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate borrowings, based on the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit
enhanced long-term indebtedness for borrowed money, and subject to increase every 90-day period by 0.25%, beginning on the 90th day after the
closing of, and funding of the loans under, the bridge facility (but subject to a 0.125% increase in the case of base rate borrowings for days 90 through
179 after such closing and funding in the event that the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term indebtedness for
borrowed money is equal to or greater than A2 by Moody’s and A by S&P), based on how long the loans under the bridge facility are outstanding.

Table of Contents

Base Rate Option

Interest will be at the base rate plus an applicable margin based on the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-
term indebtedness for borrowed money, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 or 366 days and payable quarterly
in arrears. The base rate will be, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the
“prime rate” or, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate, the highest rate per annum published by the Federal Reserve Board as the “bank
prime loan” rate or, if such rate is no longer quoted, any similar release by the Federal Reserve Board, (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus  1⁄2 of
1.0% and (iii) the one-month reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0% (provided, that the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate shall not be less than
zero).

Eurodollar Rate Option

Interest will be determined based on interest periods to be selected by CVS Health of one, two, three or six months or (if agreed by all relevant
lenders under the bridge facility) less than one month or twelve months and for each interest period will be at an annual rate equal to the London
Interbank Offered Rate, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as LIBOR, for deposits with a term equivalent to such interest
period in U.S. dollars adjusted for applicable reserve requirements (such rate as so adjusted is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate), plus the applicable margin based on the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-
term indebtedness for borrowed money. Interest will be paid at the end of each interest period (and at the end of every three months, in the case of
interest periods longer than three months) and will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

Covenants and Events of Default

The bridge facility commitment letter provides that the definitive financing agreement documenting the bridge facility (if any), which is referred
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the bridge credit agreement, shall contain covenants substantially similar to the covenants in the 2017 five-
year revolving credit facility, which relate to the following subjects:
 

 •  legal existence;
 

 •  payment of taxes;
 

 •  maintenance of insurance;
 

 •  performance of obligations;
 

 •  condition of property;
 

 •  observance of legal requirements;
 

 •  delivery of financial statements and other information;
 

 •  records;
 

 •  maintenance of authorizations;
 

 •  limitations on liens;
 

 •  limitations on acquisitions and dispositions;
 

 •  limitations on mergers and consolidations;
 

 •  limitations on restricted payments;
 

 •  limitation on upstream dividends by subsidiaries; and
 

 •  limitation on negative pledges.

Table of Contents

In addition, the bridge facility commitment letter provides that the bridge credit agreement (if executed and delivered) shall include (x) a financial
covenant requiring the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization at each quarter-end not to exceed 0.65:1.00 (defined and calculated in a
manner consistent with the 2017 five-year revolving credit facility), but with an exclusion for any indebtedness incurred by CVS Health to finance the
merger until the earlier of (i) the closing date under the bridge facility and (ii) 30 days following the termination of the merger agreement (in each case
to the extent that such indebtedness is redeemable if the merger is not consummated), and (y) a covenant restricting the incurrence of debt by CVS
Health’s subsidiaries to up to 15% of net tangible assets. In determining compliance with such test, (i) any Aetna existing indebtedness shall be excluded
from indebtedness, and (ii) indebtedness that may be incurred by all of CVS Health’s subsidiaries (excluding the Aetna existing indebtedness and other
indebtedness under capital leases incurred in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction) may not exceed $900.0 million in the aggregate, in each
case, on and following completion of the merger until such date as CVS Health shall be in compliance with such test without giving effect to the
exclusion in clause (i) of this sentence.

The bridge facility commitment letter also provides that the bridge credit agreement (if executed and delivered) shall contain events of default
substantially similar to the events of default in the 2017 five-year revolving credit facility, limited to nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of
interest or fees within five business days of due date; violation of covenants (subject to a grace period of 30 days in the case of certain affirmative
covenants); inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made; payment default or default resulting in or permitting
acceleration in respect of indebtedness of $250.0 million or more; bankruptcy or insolvency events; change in control; undischarged judgments in excess
of $250.0 million; and certain events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as ERISA, with a threshold amount of $250.0 million. In the event that any of the thresholds in the 2017 five-year revolving credit
facility is, as of the closing date of, and funding of the loans under, the bridge facility, less favorable to CVS Health, then the aforementioned
$250.0 million thresholds shall be deemed amended to match the thresholds in the 2017 five-year revolving credit facility.

Term Loan

Pursuant to the terms of the term loan agreement, the proceeds of the term loans will be available upon the satisfaction of several limited
conditions precedent on completion of the merger and, if drawn, will be used to finance, in part, the cash component of the merger consideration and to
pay fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the merger. Borrowings under the term loan agreement will be unsecured. The term
loans are pre-payable without premium or penalty (but subject to breakage costs, if applicable). The term loans under the $3.0 billion three-year tranche
do not amortize. The term loans under the $2.0 billion five-year tranche amortize in equal quarterly amounts equal to the percentage per three calendar
months’ period of the aggregate principal amount of the five-year tranche loans made on the date on which the term lenders are obligated to make loans
under the term loan agreement, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the term loan closing date, as follows: (i) 0% for each
quarterly payment date occurring after the term loan closing date, to, and including, the first anniversary of the term loan closing date, (ii) 1.25% for
each quarterly payment date occurring after the first anniversary of the term loan closing date to, and including, the third anniversary of the term loan
closing date and (iii) 2.5% for each quarterly payment date occurring after the third anniversary of the term loan closing date to, and including, the fifth
anniversary of the term loan closing date. The $3.0 billion tranche of the term loan facility will mature and be payable on the third anniversary of the
term loan closing date. The $2.0 billion tranche of the term loan facility will mature and be payable (to the extent not amortized) on the fifth anniversary
of the term loan closing date.

Conditions Precedent

The term lenders’ obligation to fund the term loans is subject to several limited conditions, including completion of the merger, the
non-occurrence of a material adverse effect (as such term is defined in the term loan agreement) on Aetna, the accuracy in all material respects of certain
representations and warranties related

to both CVS Health and Aetna, the absence of certain defaults by CVS Health, the delivery of certain financial statements of CVS Health and Aetna and
other customary conditions to completion more fully set forth in the term loan agreement.

Interest

At the option of CVS Health, borrowings under the term loan agreement will bear interest at either a base rate or at the Eurodollar rate, plus, in
each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin will range from 0.00-0.875% with respect to base rate borrowings, and 0.875-1.875% with
respect to Eurodollar rate borrowings, based on the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term indebtedness for
borrowed money.

Base Rate Option

Interest will be at the base rate plus an applicable margin based on the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-
term indebtedness for borrowed money, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 or 366 days and payable quarterly
in arrears. The base rate will be, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the
“prime rate” or, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate, the highest rate per annum published by the Federal Reserve Board as the “bank
prime loan” rate or, if such rate is no longer quoted, any similar release by the Federal Reserve Board, (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5% and
(iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, provided that the LIBOR rate shall never be less than zero.

Eurodollar Rate Option

Interest will be determined based on interest periods to be selected by CVS Health of one, two, three or six months or (if agreed by all term
lenders) less than one month or twelve months and will be at an annual rate equal to LIBOR for deposits with a term equivalent to such interest period in
U.S. dollars multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus the applicable margin based on the public ratings of CVS Health’s senior unsecured non-credit
enhanced long-term indebtedness for borrowed money. Interest will be paid at the end of each interest period (and at the end of every three months, in
the case of interest periods longer than three months) and will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

Covenants and Events of Default

The term loan agreement contains covenants relating to the following subjects:
 

 •  legal existence;
 

 •  payment of taxes;
 

 •  maintenance of insurance;
 

 •  performance of obligations;
 

 •  condition of property;
 

 •  observance of legal requirements;

Table of Contents

 •  limitations on mergers and consolidations;
 

 •  limitations on restricted payments;
 

 •  limitation on upstream dividends by subsidiaries; and
 

 •  limitation on negative pledges.

In addition, the term loan agreement includes (x) a financial covenant requiring the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization
(defined as the sum of consolidated indebtedness and shareholders’ equity determined in accordance with GAAP) at each quarter-end not to exceed
0.60:1.00; provided that (a) from the term loan closing date through and including the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, CVS Health will not
permit its ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization at the end of any fiscal quarter to exceed 0.65:1.00, and (b) until the earlier of (i) the
occurrence of the term loan closing date and (ii) the date that is 30 days following the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms,
consolidated indebtedness and total capitalization shall each be calculated exclusive of any unsecured indebtedness not exceeding $49.0 billion issued or
borrowed by CVS Health for the purpose of financing the merger (including all of the transaction costs, fees, commissions and expenses in connection
therewith) and which is redeemable or prepayable if the merger is not consummated, and (y) a covenant restricting the incurrence of debt by CVS
Health’s subsidiaries to up to 15% of net tangible assets. In determining compliance with such net tangible assets test, (i) any Aetna existing
indebtedness shall be excluded from indebtedness, and (ii) indebtedness that may be incurred by all of CVS Health’s subsidiaries (excluding the Aetna
existing indebtedness and other indebtedness under capital leases incurred in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction) may not exceed
$900.0 million in the aggregate, in each case, on and following completion of the merger until such date as CVS Health shall be in compliance with such
test without giving effect to the exclusion in clause (i) of this sentence.

The term loan agreement also contains certain events of default, limited to nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest or fees
within five business days of due date; violation of covenants (subject to a grace period of 30 days in the case of certain affirmative covenants);
inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made; payment default or default resulting in or permitting acceleration in
respect of indebtedness of $250.0 million or more; bankruptcy or insolvency events; change in control; undischarged judgments in excess of
$250.0 million; and certain events under ERISA with a threshold amount of $250.0 million. The aforementioned threshold amounts of $250.0 million
shall be applicable at all times prior to the later of (x) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility commitment letter in accordance with its
terms and (y) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility if it is entered into. At all other times, the aforementioned threshold amounts of
$250.0 million shall be reduced to $200.0 million.

Revolving Credit Agreements

Pursuant to the first amendments to each of the revolving credit agreements, the revolving lenders agreed to (w) amend the net tangible assets test
included in the covenant restricting the incurrence of debt by CVS Health’s subsidiaries by (a) excluding any Aetna existing indebtedness from
indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with the net tangible assets test, and (b) restricting the indebtedness that may be incurred by all of
CVS Health’s subsidiaries (excluding the Aetna existing indebtedness and other indebtedness under capital leases incurred in connection with a sale and
leaseback transaction) to an amount not exceeding $900.0 million in the aggregate, in each case, on and following completion of the merger until the
date that CVS Health is in compliance with the net tangible assets test without giving effect to the exclusion set forth in clause (a) above, (x) expressly
permit completion of the merger under the acquisition covenant, (y) amend the financial covenant by (a) increasing the consolidated indebtedness to
total capitalization ratio from 0.60:1.00 to 0.65:1.00 from completion of the merger through and including the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019,
and (b) excluding unsecured indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $49.0 billion incurred by CVS Health for the purpose of
financing the merger (including all of the transaction costs, fees, commissions and expenses in connection therewith) and which is redeemable or
prepayable if the merger is not consummated, from the

calculation of consolidated indebtedness and total capitalization, until the earliest of the occurrence of completion of the merger, the date that is 30 days
following the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and August 31, 2019, and (z) increase the threshold amount of specified
events of default to (a) prior to the later of (i) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility commitment letter in accordance with its terms
and (ii) the termination or other expiration of the bridge facility if it is entered into, $250.0 million, and (b) at all other times, $200.0 million.

Conditions Precedent

The first amendments to each of the revolving credit agreements became effective on December 15, 2017. The effectiveness of such amendments
was subject only to the execution and delivery of such amendments by CVS Health, the applicable administrative agent and the required lenders under
each of the revolving credit agreements.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

As of February 8, 2018, seven complaints had been filed by purported Aetna shareholders challenging the merger. The first, a putative class action
complaint, was filed by Olivier Miramond in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned Miramond v. Aetna, Inc., et
al., case number 3:18-cv-00083. The second complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by Shiva Stein
individually, is captioned Stein v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00136. The third complaint, a putative class action, was filed by Robert
Freedman in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and is captioned Freedman v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 2:18-
cv-00323. The fourth complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by Luan Pham individually, is captioned Pham v.
Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00154. The fifth complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by
Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust individually, is captioned Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. Aetna Inc. et al., case number 2:18-cv-00361. The sixth
complaint, a putative class action complaint, was filed by Dr. Eli Inzlicht-Sprei in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is
captioned Inzlicht-Sprei v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00176. The seventh complaint, a putative class action complaint, was filed by Joel
Rosenfeld in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and is captioned Rosenfeld v. Aetna, Inc., et al., case number 3:18-cv-00213.
The complaints name as defendants Aetna and each member of Aetna’s board of directors. In addition, the Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust complaint
names CVS Health and Merger Sub as defendants. The complaints generally allege, among other things, that the merger consideration in the proposed
transaction is unfair, inadequate and undervalues Aetna; that the defendants failed to conduct a fair and reasonable sales process; that the merger
agreement’s deal protection provisions improperly deter other suitors from submitting a superior offer for Aetna; that Aetna’s board of directors and
executive officers are conflicted because they have secured unique benefits for themselves from the proposed transaction not available to Aetna
shareholders generally; and that the defendants authorized the filing of a materially incomplete and misleading registration statement. Among other
remedies, the complaints seek to enjoin the Aetna special meeting and the closing of the merger, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. Defendants believe
that the complaints are without merit.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary may not contain all the information
about the merger agreement that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement attached as Annex A
to, and incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are encouraged to read the merger agreement in its entirety because it
is the legal document that governs the merger.

Explanatory Note

The merger agreement and the summary of its terms in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been included to provide information about the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the merger agreement were made
by CVS Health, Aetna and Merger Sub as of specific dates and were qualified and subject to certain limitations and exceptions agreed to by CVS
Health, Aetna and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and
warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were
negotiated for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among the parties to the merger agreement rather than to establish matters as facts. The
representations and warranties also may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality or material adverse effect that is different from what may be
viewed as material by stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, or other investors and from the materiality standard applicable to reports and
documents filed with the SEC and in some cases may be qualified by disclosures made by one party to the other, which are not reflected in the merger
agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement.

For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and any descriptions of those provisions should be read only
in conjunction with the other information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Structure of the Merger

The merger agreement provides for the merger, in which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Aetna, with Aetna surviving the merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health.

After completion of the merger, the articles of incorporation set forth as Exhibit A to the merger agreement and the by-laws of Merger Sub in
effect immediately prior to completion of the merger will be the articles of incorporation and by-laws, respectively, of Aetna, as the surviving
corporation in the merger, in each case, until amended in accordance with applicable law and the articles of incorporation and by-laws, as applicable.
After completion of the merger, the directors of Merger Sub and the officers of Aetna immediately prior to completion of the merger will be the directors
and officers, respectively, of Aetna, as the surviving corporation in the merger, in each case, until their successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified in accordance with the surviving corporation’s articles of incorporation, by-laws and applicable law.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger

The merger will be completed and become effective at such time as the statement of merger for the merger is duly filed with the Pennsylvania
Department of State (or at such later time as agreed to by Aetna and CVS Health and specified in the statement of merger for the merger). Unless
another date and time are agreed to by CVS Health and Aetna, completion of the merger will occur on the third business day following satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver, of the conditions to completion of the merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at completion of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or, to

the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of such conditions at the time of completion) described under “—Conditions to Completion of the
Merger” beginning on page 181 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS Health and Aetna expect that the merger will be completed in the second half of
2018. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of the conditions to
completion of the merger, which are summarized below. There can be no assurances as to when, or if, the merger will occur. If the merger is not
completed on or before the initial end date of December 3, 2018, either CVS Health or Aetna may terminate the merger agreement, unless all conditions
to completion of the merger have been satisfied or waived on the initial end date other than the regulatory approvals condition, and either CVS Health or
Aetna elects to extend the initial end date to March 3, 2019, in which case, if the merger is not completed on or before March 3, 2019, either CVS
Health or Aetna may terminate the merger agreement, unless all conditions to completion of the merger have been satisfied or waived on the extended
end date other than the regulatory approvals condition, and CVS Health elects to extend the extended end date to June 3, 2019, in which case, if the
merger is not completed on or before June 3, 2019, either CVS Health or Aetna may terminate the merger agreement. The right to terminate the merger
agreement after the end date, or to extend the initial end date or extended end date, will not be available to CVS Health or Aetna, as applicable, if that
party’s breach of any provision of the merger agreement resulted in the failure of the merger to be completed by the end date. See “—Conditions to
Completion of the Merger” and “—Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on pages 181 and 203, respectively, of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Merger Consideration

At completion of the merger, each Aetna common share outstanding immediately prior to completion of the merger, except for shares held by
Aetna as treasury stock or shares owned by CVS Health or by any subsidiary of Aetna or CVS Health, will be converted into the right to receive
$145.00 in cash without interest thereon and 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock (with cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares as
described under “—Fractional Shares” beginning on page 178 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus).

If, between the date of the merger agreement and completion of the merger, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Aetna or CVS
Health occurs as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the merger
consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to the merger agreement will be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event
thereon.

Fractional Shares

No fractional shares of CVS Health common stock will be issued to any holder of Aetna common shares upon completion of the merger. Instead,
all fractional shares of CVS Health common stock that a holder of Aetna common shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the merger
will be aggregated and, if a fractional share results from that aggregation, the holder will be entitled to receive cash in an amount determined by
multiplying that fraction by the CVS Health closing price in lieu of that fractional share. No interest will be paid or accrued on cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of CVS Health common stock.

No Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights for Aetna Shareholders

Pursuant to Section 1571(b) of the PBCL, holders of Aetna common shares will not be entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with
the merger.

Procedures for Surrendering Aetna Share Certificates

The conversion of Aetna common shares into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at completion of the merger.
Prior to completion of the merger, CVS Health will appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Aetna and enter into an exchange agent
agreement with the exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Aetna providing for the exchange agent to handle the exchange of certificates or book-entry
shares representing Aetna common shares for the merger consideration. As of completion of the merger, CVS Health will deposit or make available as
needed the cash and shares of CVS Health common stock comprising the merger consideration payable in respect of Aetna common shares. Promptly
(but not later than two business days) after completion of the merger, CVS Health will, or will cause the exchange agent to, send a letter of transmittal to
each person who is a record holder of Aetna common shares at completion of the merger for use in the exchange and instructions explaining how to
surrender Aetna share certificates or transfer uncertificated Aetna common shares to the exchange agent.

Aetna shareholders who submit a properly completed letter of transmittal, together with their share certificates (in the case of certificated shares)
or other evidence of transfer requested by the exchange agent (in the case of book-entry shares), will receive the merger consideration into which the
Aetna common shares were converted in the merger. The shares of CVS Health common stock constituting part of the merger consideration will be
delivered to Aetna shareholders in book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by an Aetna shareholder or otherwise required under
applicable law. After completion of the merger, each certificate that previously represented Aetna common shares and each uncertificated Aetna
common share that previously was registered to a holder on Aetna’s stock transfer books, except for shares held by Aetna as treasury stock or shares
owned by CVS Health or by any subsidiary of Aetna or CVS Health, will only represent the right to receive the merger consideration into which those
Aetna common shares have been converted (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of CVS Health common stock as described under “—Fractional
Shares” beginning on page 178 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and any dividends on the shares of CVS Health common stock into which such
Aetna shares have been converted as described below under “—Procedures for Surrendering Aetna Share Certificates”).

Neither CVS Health nor Aetna will be responsible for transfer or other similar taxes and fees incurred by holders of Aetna common shares in
connection with the merger. Those taxes and fees, if any, will be the sole responsibility of such holders. In addition, if there is a transfer of ownership of
Aetna common shares that is not registered in the records of Aetna’s transfer agent, payment of the merger consideration as described above (and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of CVS Health common stock as described under “—Fractional Shares” beginning on page 178 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and any dividends on the shares of CVS Health common stock into which such Aetna shares have been converted as described
below under “—Procedures for Surrendering Aetna Share Certificates”) will be made to a person other than the person in whose name the certificate or
uncertificated share so surrendered is registered only if the certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer or the
uncertificated share is properly transferred, and the person requesting the payment must pay to the exchange agent any transfer or other similar taxes
required as a result of such payment or satisfy the exchange agent that any transfer or other similar taxes have been paid or that no payment of those
taxes is necessary.

After completion of the merger, CVS Health will not pay dividends with a record date on or after completion of the merger to any holder of any
Aetna share certificates or uncertificated Aetna common shares on the shares of CVS Health common stock into which such Aetna shares have been
converted until such holder surrenders the Aetna share certificates or transfers the uncertificated Aetna common shares as described above. However,
once those certificates or uncertificated Aetna common shares are surrendered or transferred, as applicable, CVS Health will pay to such holder, without
interest, any dividends on the shares of CVS Health common stock into which such Aetna shares have been converted with a record date on or after
completion of the merger that have been paid prior to such surrender or transfer, as applicable.

Treatment of Aetna Equity Awards

Aetna Stock Appreciation Rights

As of completion of the merger, each outstanding vested Aetna stock appreciation right (including those Aetna stock appreciation rights that vest
by their terms as of completion of the merger), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
excess, if any, of the equity award cash consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such Aetna stock appreciation right multiplied by
the total number of Aetna common shares subject to such Aetna stock appreciation right.

Each Aetna stock appreciation right that is not vested as of completion of the merger or that is granted after the date of the merger agreement (to
the extent permitted under the merger agreement), at completion of the merger, will be assumed by CVS Health and will become an assumed stock
appreciation right representing the right to receive a payment in shares of CVS Health common stock on the same terms and conditions, except that the
number of shares of CVS Health common stock subject to the assumed stock appreciation right will equal the product of the number of Aetna common
shares that were subject to such Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger multiplied by the equity award exchange
ratio, with such product rounded down to the nearest whole share of CVS Health common stock. The per share exercise price for each assumed stock
appreciation right will equal the exercise price per share of such Aetna stock appreciation right immediately prior to completion of the merger divided
by the equity award exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Aetna Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units

Immediately prior to completion of the merger, each outstanding Aetna RSU and each outstanding Aetna PSU that provides for accelerated
vesting upon completion of the merger will vest and will be converted into the right to receive, with respect to each Aetna common share underlying the
Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU, the merger consideration, less applicable tax withholdings.

Each Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU that is not converted into a right to receive the merger consideration or is granted after the date of the merger
agreement (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement) will be assumed by CVS Health and will be converted into a time-based restricted stock
unit award covering the number of whole shares of CVS Health common stock equal to the product of the number of Aetna common shares underlying
such assumed Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU immediately prior to completion of the merger (with the performance of each Aetna PSU to be determined
based on the applicable award agreement relating to such Aetna PSU) multiplied by the equity award exchange ratio with such product rounded down to
the nearest whole share of CVS Health common stock. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, each assumed Aetna RSU or Aetna
PSU will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Aetna RSU or Aetna PSU immediately prior
to completion of the merger (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder’s employment in
connection with or following the merger).

Listing of CVS Health Common Stock

The merger agreement obligates CVS Health to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of CVS Health common stock to be issued in the
merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to completion of the merger. Approval for listing on the NYSE of the shares
of CVS Health common stock issuable to Aetna shareholders in the merger, subject to official notice of issuance, is a condition to the obligations of
CVS Health and Aetna to complete the merger.

Governance and Social Matters Following Completion of the Merger

Board of Directors of CVS Health. CVS Health will take all necessary corporate action to cause, effective at completion of the merger, the size of
the board of directors of CVS Health to be increased by three and the

Definition of “Material Adverse Effect”

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by “material adverse effect” on the party making such
representations and warranties.

For purposes of the merger agreement, “material adverse effect” means, with respect to CVS Health or Aetna, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, business or results of operations of that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that no effect to the
extent resulting from any of the following events, changes, developments or occurrences will be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a material adverse effect, or whether a material adverse effect would reasonably be expected to occur:
 

 •  any changes in general United States or global economic conditions;
 

 
•  any changes in conditions generally affecting the industry in which that party or any of its subsidiaries operate, including, in the case of

Aetna, the health insurance or managed care industry (including, in the case of Aetna, the Medicare Advantage managed care industry);
 

 
•  any decline, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of that party’s common stock (but not any facts or occurrences giving rise

to or contributing to that decline that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of material adverse effect);
 

 
•  any changes in regulatory, legislative or political conditions or in securities, credit, financial, debt or other capital markets, in each case in

the United States or any foreign jurisdiction;
 

 
•  any failure, in and of itself, by that party to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of

enrollments, revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (but not any facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to that failure that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of material adverse effect);

 

 
•  the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the public announcement or pendency of the merger agreement or the merger, the taking

of any action required or expressly contemplated by the

merger agreement or the identity of, or any facts or circumstances relating to any other party to the merger agreement or that other party’s
subsidiaries, including the impact of any of the foregoing on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of that party or any of its
subsidiaries with governmental authorities, customers, providers, suppliers, partners, officers or employees (except with respect to any
representation or warranty that is intended to address the consequences of the execution, delivery or performance of the merger agreement
or completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement);

 

 
•  any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification, amendment, authoritative interpretation, change or proposal of any

applicable law of or by any governmental authority;
 

 
•  any changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles or, in the case of Aetna, statutory accounting principles or actuarial

standards of practice (or, in any of such cases, authoritative interpretations thereof);

escalation or worsening of any acts of war, sabotage, cyberattack or terrorism threatened or underway as of the date of the merger
agreement;

 

 
•  any taking of any action at the written request of or with the consent of any other party to the merger agreement (but not any facts or

occurrences resulting from that action that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of material adverse effect);
 

 
•  any reduction in the credit rating of that party or any of its subsidiaries (but not any facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to that

reduction that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of material adverse effect);
 

 
•  any epidemic, plague, pandemic or other outbreak of illness or public health event, hurricane, earthquake, flood or other natural disasters,

acts of God or any change resulting from weather conditions;
 

 
•  any changes to reimbursement rates or in methods or procedures for determining those rates, any changes to eligibility requirements or any

other programmatic changes by any governmental authority, in each case whether such changes are applicable nationally or to only certain
geographic areas; or

 

 
•  any claims, actions, suits or proceedings arising from allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty or violation of applicable law relating to the

merger agreement or the merger;

except, in the case of the events, changes, developments or occurrences referred to in the first, second, fourth, seventh, eighth and thirteenth bullets in
the immediately preceding list, to the extent that those events, changes, developments or occurrences have a materially disproportionate adverse effect
on that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect those changes, developments or occurrences have on other companies
operating in the industries in which that party or any of its subsidiaries operate (except that any such disproportionate effect on that party and its
subsidiaries to the extent resulting from the greater concentration of the businesses of that party and its subsidiaries in any particular industry or
geography relative to other companies operating in the industries in which that party or any of its subsidiaries operate will not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a material adverse effect on that party and its subsidiaries).

Neither Aetna nor CVS Health may adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the meeting of its shareholders or stockholders, respectively, without the
prior written consent of the other party. However, each party may, without the prior written consent of the other party, adjourn or postpone the meeting
of its shareholders or stockholders, respectively, after consultation with the other party, if that party believes in good faith that such adjournment or
postponement is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional time to (i) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the required vote of its
shareholders or stockholders, respectively, in connection with the merger at such meeting, or (ii) distribute any supplement or amendment to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus that its board of directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under
applicable law and for such supplement or amendment to be reviewed by its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, prior to such meeting.

Unless the merger agreement is earlier terminated, Aetna’s board of directors must submit the merger agreement for adoption at the meeting of its
shareholders called for such purpose, even if it changes its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement. Similarly, unless the merger
agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, CVS Health’s board of directors must submit the stock issuance for approval at the meeting
of its stockholders called for such purpose, even if it changes its recommendation with respect to the stock issuance.

Obligations to Recommend the Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Stock Issuance

As discussed under “Aetna Proposal I: Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement and CVS Health Proposal I: Approval of the Stock
Issuance—Aetna’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Aetna Board of Directors that Aetna Shareholders Approve and Adopt the Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 101 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Aetna
shareholders vote “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. Aetna’s board of directors, however, may (i) withdraw or qualify, amend
or modify in a manner adverse to CVS Health its recommendation that Aetna shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement or (ii) recommend,
adopt or approve an alternative acquisition proposal for Aetna, in each case, under specified circumstances as discussed under “—No Solicitation”

or approve an alternative acquisition proposal for CVS Health, in each case, under specified circumstances as discussed under “—No Solicitation”
beginning on page 190 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

However, unless the merger agreement has previously been terminated in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement must be submitted to
Aetna shareholders for adoption (even if Aetna’s board of directors has made an adverse recommendation change, or if an acquisition proposal for Aetna
has been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted). Similarly, unless the merger agreement has previously been terminated in accordance
with its terms, the stock issuance must be submitted to CVS Health stockholders for approval (even if CVS Health’s board of directors has made an
adverse recommendation change, or if an acquisition proposal for CVS Health has been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted).

that the failure to waive such provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (except that the obligation not to fail to
enforce any such standstill or similar agreement under this clause (vi) will apply with respect to known breaches of such agreements only).

However, if at any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna shareholders, in the case of Aetna, or at any time
prior to the approval of the stock issuance by CVS Health stockholders, in the case of CVS Health, Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, receives a
written acquisition proposal made after the date of the merger agreement which has not resulted from a violation of the solicitation restrictions described

In addition, Aetna’s or CVS Health’s board of directors, as applicable, is not permitted to take any of the actions described in the second bullet
above unless that party has delivered to the other party written notice advising the other party that it intends to take such action, and Aetna or CVS
Health, as applicable, continues to advise the other party, on a current basis, after taking that action of the status and material terms of any discussions
and negotiations with the applicable third party. Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, must also notify the other party promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours) after receipt by Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable (or any of its representatives), of any acquisition proposal, any indication that a third party
is considering making an acquisition proposal or any request for information relating to Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, or any of its subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, or any of its subsidiaries by any third party that, to
the knowledge of Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, or any member of its board of directors, is considering making, is reasonably likely to make or

response to such superior proposal and (iii) after such three business day period, Aetna’s or CVS Health’s board of directors, as applicable, determines in
good faith, taking into account any proposal by the other party to amend the terms of the merger agreement, that such acquisition proposal continues to

notification from Aetna or CVS Health, as applicable, to the other party and will commence a new notice period under the preceding sentence, except
that such new notice period will be for two business days rather than three business days.

agreement proposed by the other party and (iii) after such three business day period, Aetna’s or CVS Health’s board of directors, as applicable,

board of directors considers to be appropriate (including the identity of the third party making the acquisition proposal, the expected timing and
likelihood of completion, any governmental or other approval requirements (including divestitures and entry into other commitments and
limitations),break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to completion and availability of necessary financing), would result in a
transaction (i) that if completed, is more favorable to that party’s shareholders or stockholders, respectively, from a financial point of view than the
merger (taking into account any proposal by the other party to amend the terms of the merger agreement), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the person making the acquisition proposal, any approval requirements and all other
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such acquisition proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part),

applicable, has made an adverse recommendation change, or if an acquisition proposal for that party has been made).

Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant

CVS Health and Aetna have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to complete the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as
promptly as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all necessary governmental or third-party filings, notices and other
documents and obtaining as promptly as practicable and thereafter maintaining all consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, variances,
exemptions, franchises, clearances, authorizations, acknowledgments, orders or other confirmations required to be obtained from any governmental
authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to complete the merger, and complying with the terms and conditions of each
consent and approval and cooperating to the extent reasonable with the other parties to the merger agreement in their efforts to comply with their
obligations under the merger agreement, including in seeking to obtain as promptly as practicable any required consents and approvals.

CVS Health’s and Aetna’s obligation to use their respective reasonable best efforts includes contesting (which includes contesting by litigation)
any (i) action, suit, investigation or proceeding brought by any governmental authority in a federal, state or administrative court seeking to enjoin,
restrain, prevent, prohibit or make illegal completion of the merger or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection with the
merger or (ii) order that has been entered by a federal, state or administrative court that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal completion
of the merger or imposes any damages, terms or conditions in connection with the merger. CVS Health’s obligation to use its reasonable best efforts

regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or Aetna: (i) the expiration or early termination of any applicable waiting period relating to the merger
under the HSR Act, (ii) approvals in connection with any other applicable law that is designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having

subsidiaries required by the merger agreement to take or cause to be taken any action (or refrain or cause to refrain from taking any action) or agree or
cause to agree to any term, condition or limitation as a condition to, or in connection with the specified regulatory matters, if such action (or refraining
from such action), term, condition or limitation would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a regulatory
material adverse effect on CVS Health or Aetna. “Regulatory material adverse effect” means, with respect to CVS Health or Aetna, a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, business, revenue or EBITDA (as defined in the merger agreement) of that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
For purposes of determining whether any action, term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a regulatory material adverse
effect on Aetna, Aetna and its subsidiaries will collectively be deemed to be a company the size of (and with revenue and EBITDA equal to those of)
CVS Health and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Aetna and its subsidiaries). For purposes of determining
whether any action, term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a regulatory material adverse effect on CVS Health or
Aetna, impacts on CVS Health, Aetna or any of their respective subsidiaries will be aggregated.

CVS Health will have principal responsibility for directing, devising, and implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, for
responding to any request from, inquiry by, or investigation by (including directing the timing, nature, and substance of all such responses), and for
leading all meetings and communications with any governmental authority that has authority to enforce any antitrust law.

In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Aetna and CVS Health has agreed to, as promptly as practicable following the date of the merger
agreement, make all filings with all governmental authorities that may be or may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under the merger
agreement or applicable law to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including: (i) not later than 30
business days after the date of the merger agreement, CVS Health filing, or causing to be filed, “Form A Statements” or similar change of control
applications, with the insurance commissioners or regulators or departments of health or other governmental authorities in each jurisdiction where
required by applicable law seeking approval of CVS Health’s acquisition of control of each of Aetna’s regulated subsidiaries that would result from the
merger; (ii) as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement, CVS Health filing, or causing to be filed, any pre-acquisition notifications
on “Form E” or similar market share notifications to be filed in each jurisdiction where required by applicable laws with respect to the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (iii) not later than 20 business days after the date of the merger agreement (unless the parties
otherwise agree to another date), each of Aetna and CVS Health filing its respective notification and report with the FTC and the DOJ with respect to
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and requesting early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
(iv) not later than 30 business days after the date of the merger agreement, Aetna and CVS Health filing any required notices to the U.S. Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services, referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as CMS, with a separate notice to the CMS Medicare Drug Benefit
Group and Central and/or Regional Office Medicare Advantage and/or Part D plan manager, if applicable; and (v) promptly following the date of the
merger agreement make any other filing that may be required under any applicable law or by any governmental authority with jurisdiction over
enforcement of any of the foregoing.

that neither it nor any of its representatives will participate in any material or substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with any
governmental authority, or any member of the staff of any governmental authority, in respect of any filing, proceeding, investigation (including the
settlement of any investigation), litigation, or other inquiry regarding the merger unless that party consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such governmental authority, allows the other party to participate.

CVS Health and Aetna have agreed not to, and to cause their respective subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or
license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license) any business, corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division or
part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consent or approval of any governmental authority necessary to complete the merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the expiration or early termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any governmental authority entering an order prohibiting completion of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) otherwise prevent or materially
delay completion of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, (i) CVS Health, Aetna and their respective affiliates are not required to take any action
that is not conditioned upon completion of the merger and (ii) Aetna and its affiliates are not permitted to agree to any obligation or other action relating
to the consents or approvals required in connection with the merger without CVS Health’s prior consent (which consent may not be withheld, delayed or
conditioned if doing so would be inconsistent with CVS Health’s obligations described under this section). In addition, Aetna will not voluntarily extend
the waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the merger or enter into any agreement with a third party to not complete the merger without the
consent of CVS Health.

Financing

CVS Health Obligations to Obtain Financing

Each of CVS Health and Merger Sub has agreed to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
complete and obtain the debt financing for the merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the debt financing, on substantially
the terms and conditions described in the debt commitment letter, including (i) negotiating and entering into definitive financing agreements on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the debt commitment letter, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the definitive
financing agreements, (or on other terms and conditions agreed by CVS Health, Aetna and CVS Health’s financing sources, which are referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the financing sources) by completion of the merger and (ii) satisfying or causing to be satisfied (or, if determined
advisable by CVS Health, obtaining the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the debt financing within CVS Health’s control and
complying or causing to be complied with all of its obligations pursuant to the debt commitment letter and any of the definitive financing agreements to
the extent the failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the timing of completion of the merger or the availability at completion of
the merger of sufficient aggregate proceeds of the debt financing to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Upon satisfaction
of all conditions to funding contained in the debt

commitment letter, each of CVS Health and Merger Sub has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the financing sources that are party to
the debt commitment letter and the definitive financing agreements, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the financing
sources, to fund the debt financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to pay related fees and expenses
at completion of the merger (including by taking enforcement action to cause the financing sources to provide the debt financing) and (ii) enforce all of
its rights under the debt commitment letter.

If any portion of the financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter becomes unavailable and such portion is necessary to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (except in accordance with the express terms set forth in the debt commitment letter or unless
concurrently replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by commitments subject to substantially the same conditions as those set forth in the debt commitment
letter from other financing sources or from proceeds of other sources of financing or cash), CVS Health and Merger Sub must (i) use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing as promptly as practicable in an amount that will enable CVS Health and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and that does not contain additional (or changes to the) conditions set forth in the debt commitment
letter delivered to Aetna on or prior to the date of the merger agreement that, in each case, could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of
CVS Health or Merger Sub to timely complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) promptly notify Aetna of such
unavailability and the reason for such unavailability.

CVS Health has agreed to give Aetna prompt notice of, among other things, (i) any material breach by any party to the debt commitment letter or
any of the definitive financing agreements of which it has become aware,
(ii) any termination of the debt commitment letter or any of the definitive financing agreements and (iii) the receipt of any notice or other
communication from any financing source with respect to such financing source’s failure or anticipated failure to fund its commitments under the debt
commitment letter or any of the definitive financing agreements, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent such breach or termination could
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay completion of the merger or otherwise result in sufficient proceeds of the debt financing to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement not being available at completion of the merger. CVS Health has also agreed to
keep Aetna reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the debt financing.

CVS Health and Merger Sub may not, without Aetna’s prior written consent, permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the debt commitment letter or any of the definitive financing agreements unless the terms of the debt commitment letter or
definitive financing agreements, in each case as so amended, modified or waived, are substantially similar to those in the debt commitment letter or
definitive financing agreement prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or waiver (other than economic terms, which must be as good as
or better for CVS Health and Merger Sub as those in the debt commitment letter or applicable definitive financing agreement(s) prior to giving effect to
such amendment, modification or waiver). However, in the case of amendments or modifications of the debt commitment letter or any of the definitive
financing agreements, the foregoing will only apply if such amendment or modification (i) could reasonably be expected to (A) adversely affect the
ability or likelihood of CVS Health or Merger Sub timely consummating the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (B) make the timely
funding of the debt financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the debt financing less likely to occur, (ii) reduces the aggregate amount
of the debt financing or (iii) materially and adversely affects the ability of CVS Health or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against other parties to the
debt commitment letter. In any event, CVS Health may amend the debt commitment letter or any of the definitive financing agreements to (x) add
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the debt commitment letter as of the date of the merger
agreement and consent to the assignment after the date of the merger agreement of lending commitments under the debt commitment letter to other
lenders, or (y) increase the aggregate amount of the debt financing.

connection with the debt financing and the alternative financing; and

long as such trademarks, service marks and logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or is reasonably likely to harm or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) neither Aetna nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur
prior to completion of the merger any other liability or obligation in connection with the debt financing, unless CVS Health reimburses or is required to
reimburse or indemnify Aetna and its subsidiaries pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise agrees to do so, (ii) none of Aetna, its subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors or employees will be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the debt financing that
is not contingent upon completion of the merger or that would be effective prior to completion of the merger (other than the authorization letters
contemplated by the eighth bullet in the list above) and for the avoidance of doubt, the boards of directors or other equivalent governing bodies of CVS
Health, Merger Sub, and/or Aetna, as the surviving corporation in the merger, shall enter into or provide any resolutions, consents, approvals or other
closing arrangements on behalf of Aetna and its subsidiaries as may be required by the financing sources pursuant to the bridge facility commitment
letter at, or as of, completion of the merger, and (iii) nothing will obligate Aetna or any of its subsidiaries to provide, or cause to be provided, any legal
opinion by its counsel, or to provide, or cause to be provided, any information or take, or cause to be taken, any action to the extent it would reasonably
be expected, in the reasonable judgment of Aetna, to result in a violation of applicable law or loss of any privilege.

fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with
or in respect of any thereof) suffered or incurred in connection with any action taken by Aetna, any of or its subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives pursuant to the obligations described above (other than the use of any information provided by Aetna, any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective representatives in writing for use in connection with the debt financing), except in the event such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement are determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of, or resulted from, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Aetna, any of its subsidiaries or any
of their respective representatives.

Proxy Statement and Registration Statement Covenant

As promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement, (i) Aetna and CVS Health have agreed to prepare and file with the SEC this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii) CVS Health has agreed to prepare and file with the SEC the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part. Aetna and CVS Health have agreed that this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement on Form
S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and other applicable law.

Each of Aetna and CVS Health will use its reasonable best efforts to have this joint proxy statement/prospectus cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after its filing, and CVS Health will use its reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing and to keep the registration

statement/prospectus or the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, received by such party from
the SEC, and provide the other with copies of all substantive correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the

statement/prospectus or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Aetna and CVS Health will provide the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or response and consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with

If at any time prior to the later of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by Aetna’s shareholders and the approval of the stock

Table of Contents

Indemnification and Insurance

The merger agreement provides that, from and after completion of the merger, CVS Health will (and CVS Health will cause Aetna, as the
surviving corporation in the merger, to), to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present or
former director, officer or employee of Aetna or any of its subsidiaries and each present or former director, trustee, officer or employee of any other
entity or benefit plan serving at the request or for the benefit of Aetna or any of its subsidiaries (which individuals are collectively referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as indemnified persons) from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and all other reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any threatened, asserted, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation arising out of or pertaining to such
indemnified person’s duties or services as a director, officer or employee of Aetna or any of its subsidiaries, or a director, trustee, officer or employee of
any other entity or benefit plan serving at the request or for the benefit of Aetna or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to completion of the merger, and
(ii) subject to certain conditions, promptly pay or advance to such indemnified person any such expenses incurred by such indemnified person in
defending, serving as a witness in or otherwise participating in any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in advance of its final
disposition.

The merger agreement also provides that, for a period of six years after completion of the merger, the organizational documents of Aetna, as the
surviving corporation in the merger, and its subsidiaries must contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and limitations on liability of directors and officers than were set forth in the organizational documents of Aetna as of the date of the merger
agreement. Such provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after completion of the merger in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to completion of the merger, were directors, officers or employees of
Aetna or any of its subsidiaries, except to the extent any such modification is required by applicable law.

The merger agreement provides that, at Aetna’s option and expense, prior to completion of the merger, Aetna may purchase and prepay the
premium for a six-year “tail” insurance policy of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing other terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to the directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries of Aetna and its subsidiaries as Aetna’s directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage
existing as of the date of the merger agreement, with a claims period of six years after completion of the merger for claims, actions, suits, proceedings,
inquiries and investigations arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred at or prior to completion of the merger. However, the premium for
such tail policy may not exceed 300% of the annual premium paid by Aetna for its directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage existing as of the date of
the merger agreement. If Aetna does not obtain such a tail policy prior to completion of the merger, CVS Health or Aetna, as the surviving corporation
in the merger, must obtain such a policy, except that the premium for such tail policy may not exceed the maximum premium referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence. If the premium for such tail policy would exceed such maximum premium, CVS Health or Aetna, as applicable, will
only be required to obtain as much directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage as can be obtained by paying such maximum premium. CVS Health and
Aetna, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will cause any such tail policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term, and CVS
Health will cause Aetna, as the surviving corporation in the merger, to honor its obligations thereunder.

Employee Matters

From completion of the merger through the later of the first anniversary of completion of the merger and May 31, 2019, which period is referred
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the benefits continuation period, CVS Health will provide to employees of Aetna and its subsidiaries who
continue employment with Aetna (as the surviving corporation in the merger), CVS Health or any of CVS Health’s subsidiaries, which employees are
referred to as continuing employees, base salary, bonus and other cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the base
salary, bonus and other cash incentive compensation

Table of Contents

opportunities provided to such continuing employees immediately prior to completion of the merger, employee benefits (excluding equity compensation,
defined benefit pension plan benefits, retention or change in control payments or awards or any similar compensation or benefit) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to such continuing employees immediately prior to completion of the merger, and equity
incentive awards with a target value no less favorable than the target value of the equity incentive awards provided to such continuing employees
immediately prior to completion of the merger. Until the second anniversary of the completion of the merger, CVS Health will provide the continuing
employees with severance benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than those provided to such individuals
immediately prior to completion of the merger, as set forth in Aetna’s severance pay plan.

With respect to each employee benefit plan maintained by CVS Health or any of its subsidiaries in which continuing employees become eligible
to participate, CVS Health will waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements,
recognize continuing employees’ service accrued (to the extent credited by Aetna or its subsidiaries) prior to completion of the merger for all purposes
under such plans (except for the purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) and if applicable, cause to be credited, in any new
Aetna plan that is a health plan in which continuing employees participate, any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the continuing
employees and their beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year in which completion of the merger occur prior to their
participation in CVS Health’s health plans to avoid any double counting during the year in which the merger is completed of such deductibles or
out-of-pocket expenses.

With respect to specified Aetna annual cash incentive plans, CVS Health will provide each participant who remains employed with the surviving
corporation through the end of the year during which the merger is completed, with an annual cash incentive award for the year during which the merger
is completed. The amount of such annual cash incentive award will be determined as the sum of the following: (i) a pro-rated portion of the bonus with
respect to the pre-closing portion of the year the merger is completed, which will be determined based upon actual performance through the date the
merger is completed, as determined by Aetna in accordance with the applicable annual cash incentive plan plus (ii) a pro-rated portion of the bonus with
respect to the post-closing portion of the year during which the merger is completed, which bonus will be payable at the applicable annual cash incentive
plan participant’s target incentive level under such annual cash incentive plan. If a participant’s employment is terminated by CVS Health or the
surviving corporation for any reason following the date on which the merger is completed and through the end of the year during which the merger is
completed other than for cause (or any voluntary termination of employment), the participant will be entitled to the prorated payment set forth in clause
(i), plus an amount equal to the participant’s target value pro-rated by a ratio equal to the quotient of the number of days worked between completion of
the merger and the participant’s termination date divided by 365.

Aetna is permitted to establish a cash-based retention program providing for retention payments in an aggregate amount of up to $70 million, with
the individual retention bonuses to be determined by the Chief Executive Officer of Aetna (in consultation with CVS Health). Certain retention bonus
payments will be made upon completion of the merger and the remaining payments will be made between the three- and twelve-month period following
the date of completion of the merger, subject to the participant’s continued employment with Aetna or its subsidiaries (or upon an earlier involuntary
termination under certain circumstances). Executive officers and members of the Aetna executive leadership team are excluded from participating in this
retention program.

after the end date, or to extend the initial end date to March 3, 2019 or extended end date to June 3, 2019, will not be available to

either (i) is incapable of being cured by the end date or (ii) has not been cured within 45 days following notice from the
non-breaching party of such breach or failure to perform. However, the right to terminate the merger agreement in respect of the
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or the failure to perform any covenant or agreement will not be available to the other
party if such party is then in breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements as would cause the applicable
condition to completion of the merger related to accuracy of its representations and warranties or performance of its covenants and
agreements not to be satisfied; or

If the merger agreement is validly terminated, the merger agreement will become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any
shareholder, stockholder or representative of any party) to any other party, except that certain designated provisions, including the provisions regarding
termination fees, will survive termination. However, subject to the provisions described under “—Exclusive Remedy” beginning on page 207 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, none of the parties to the merger agreement will be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages resulting from
any fraud by any party or any willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement. For purposes of
the merger agreement, the failure of CVS Health, for any reason, other than any material breach of the merger agreement by Aetna, to pay the cash
component of the merger consideration at completion of the merger will be deemed to constitute a willful breach of the merger agreement.

satisfied or waived other than (i) the regulatory approvals condition, (ii) the condition requiring the absence of any applicable law or order being in
effect in the U.S. that enjoins, prevents or prohibits completion of the merger (but only if that condition is not satisfied solely due to any applicable law
or order in respect of the specified regulatory matters) and (iii) those conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the date on which the
merger is completed, but which conditions would be satisfied if completion of the merger were to occur on the date of termination.

However, CVS Health will have no obligation to pay the $2.1 billion termination fee referred to above if the failure of the regulatory approvals
condition to be satisfied is caused by Aetna’s willful breach of its obligations described under “—Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant” beginning on page
194 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Exclusive Remedy

Except in the case of fraud, if either party receives a termination fee in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement, the receipt of the
termination fee (together with any applicable amounts referred to in the immediately following paragraph) will be the receiving party’s sole and
exclusive remedy against the paying party and its subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners, shareholders, stockholders,
managers, members, affiliates and representatives, and none of the paying party, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future partners, shareholders, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or representatives will have any further liability or obligation, in each case
relating to or arising out of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

To the extent that a termination fee is not promptly paid by any party when due, the party failing to pay the termination fee is also required to pay
any costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the other party in connection with legal action taken to enforce the
merger agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount, together with interest on the unpaid
fee.

Other Expenses

Table of Contents

INTERESTS OF AETNA’S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

In considering the recommendation of the Aetna board of directors to approve and adopt the merger agreement, Aetna shareholders should be
aware that Aetna’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Aetna
shareholders generally. Aetna’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating
the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including
the merger), and in recommending to Aetna shareholders that the merger agreement be approved and adopted. These interests include those described
below.

Completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will constitute a change in control of Aetna under all of the Aetna
agreements and arrangements described below.

Continuing Board Service

At completion of the merger, the size of the board of directors of CVS Health will be increased by three and the vacancies created thereby will be
filled by Mark T. Bertolini, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aetna, and two other individuals who are serving on the board of directors of
Aetna immediately prior to completion of the merger who meet CVS Health’s independence criteria as in effect as of such time and who will be jointly
designated by Aetna and CVS Health prior to completion of the merger.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CVS Health and Aetna have not made a determination as to which two additional members
of the board of directors of Aetna will be designated to CVS Health’s board of directors at completion of the merger.

Treatment of Outstanding Aetna Equity Awards

If the merger is consummated, any then outstanding equity awards (including Aetna stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs)
granted by Aetna to executive officers will be treated as described under “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Aetna Equity Awards” beginning on
page 180 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If the merger is consummated, any Aetna RSUs held by Aetna’s non-employee directors, including
RSUs granted annually and any deferred stock units, will be settled in cash at a value equal to the fair market value of Aetna common shares on the
effective date of the merger pursuant to the terms of Aetna’s 2010 Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan.

Vested Equity Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers

Each of Aetna’s executive officers and non-employee directors currently holds equity awards that have either vested or that are scheduled to vest
before completion of the merger, assuming that completion of the merger occurs on December 3, 2018, which is referred to in this section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the assumed completion date of the merger. Aetna PSUs held by Aetna’s executive officers that are based on 2015 – 2017
performance will be earned at the actual performance level of 120% of target, and any other Aetna PSUs held by Aetna’s executive officers that are
scheduled to vest before the completion of the merger will be earned in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements. For purposes of
the quantifications in this section, the number of Aetna common shares acquired by Aetna’s executive officers for Aetna PSUs that are based on 2015 –
2017 performance has been determined at a performance level of 120% of the target value, representing the actual performance for these units, and the
number of Aetna common shares acquired by Aetna’s executive officers through the vesting of all other Aetna PSUs between the execution of the
merger agreement and the assumed completion date of the merger has been determined assuming that all such other Aetna PSUs vest at target level.

awards that are vested or scheduled to vest before the assumed completion

Table of Contents

date of the merger are quantified below. As previously described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the exchange ratio is fixed, which means that
it will not change between now and the date of completion of the merger, regardless of whether the market price of either shares of CVS Health common
stock or Aetna common shares changes. Therefore, the value of the stock component of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of
shares of CVS Health common stock at the time Aetna shareholders receive shares of CVS Health common stock in the merger. For purposes of
quantifying the estimated values in this section, the calculations were done using a value per Aetna common share of $205.03, which is calculated based
on the price of a share of CVS Health common stock of $71.65, which (consistent with the rules set forth for Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K) is the
average closing price of a share of CVS Health common stock over the five-business-day-period following the first public announcement of the merger
agreement.

For each of Aetna’s non-employee directors, the respective estimated value of the Aetna common shares (whether held directly or indirectly),
vested deferred stock units (as described below) and unvested annual Aetna RSUs that are scheduled to vest before the assumed completion date of the
merger is: Mr. Aguirre ($4,460,939); Mr. Clark ($8,691,684); Mrs. Cohen ($28,718,593); Dr. Coye ($4,966,393); Mr. Farah ($12,303,508); Mr. Garten
($7,599,232); Mrs. Hancock ($31,984,852); Mr. Harrington ($10,055,340); Mr. Ludwig ($11,918,714); Dr. Newhouse ($17,061,070); and Senator
Snowe ($855,673).

For each of Aetna’s executive officers, the respective estimated value of the Aetna common shares (whether held directly or indirectly) and Aetna
equity awards that are currently vested or scheduled to vest before the assumed completion date of the merger (with the value of each vested Aetna stock
appreciation right calculated based on $205.03 minus the applicable per share exercise price for the Aetna stock appreciation right), and, in the case of
Messrs. Bertolini and Soistman and Ms. McCarthy, vested deferred stock units (as described below) is: Mr. Bertolini ($465,266,762); Mr. Guertin
($20,355,924); Mr. Loveman ($22,512,574); Ms. Lynch ($38,181,591); Mr. Sabatino ($10,317,584); Mr. Jelinek ($12,008,732); Ms. McCarthy
($42,293,601); Dr. Paz ($13,468,703); and Mr. Soistman ($26,510,383).

On January 25, 2018, Aetna announced that Mr. Loveman will be leaving the company. Because Mr. Loveman’s last day of employment and the
terms of any additional agreement between him and Aetna have not been agreed upon as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the values
of Mr. Loveman’s equity interests and severance benefits have been calculated based on the terms of his arrangements as in effect as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus in the same manner as Aetna’s other named executive officers.

Unvested Equity Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers

As discussed under the heading “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Aetna Equity Awards,” beginning on page 180 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, certain outstanding unvested Aetna equity awards, by their terms, automatically vest either immediately upon completion of the
merger or upon an involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) in connection with completion of the merger. Aetna PSUs held by
Aetna’s executive officers will be earned either at target or higher actual performance as of the date of completion of the merger, depending on the
applicable terms and the ability of Aetna to determine actual performance as of completion of the merger. For purposes of the quantifications in this
section, the number of Aetna common shares acquired by Aetna’s executive officers through the vesting of Aetna PSUs upon completion of the merger
or upon an involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) in connection with completion of the merger has been determined assuming
that all Aetna PSUs vest at target level.

With respect to Aetna’s named executive officers, for the quantification of the equity awards that are expected to vest as of the assumed
completion date of the merger, including as a result of an assumed involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) in connection with
completion of the merger on that date (without taking into account any potential grants in the ordinary course of business to the extent permitted under
the merger agreement between the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the assumed completion date of the merger), see “—Quantification
of Potential Payments to Aetna Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 216 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

For the four Aetna executive officers who are not named executive officers, the estimated values of the unvested equity awards (including Aetna
stock appreciation rights, Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs) held by each such executive officer that are expected to vest as of the assumed completion date
of the merger, including as a result of an assumed involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) in connection with completion of the
merger on that date (without taking into account any potential grants in the ordinary course of business to the extent permitted under the merger
agreement between the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the assumed completion date of the merger) (with the value of each unvested
Aetna stock appreciation right calculated based on $205.03 minus the applicable per share exercise price for the Aetna stock appreciation right) is as
follows: Mr. Jelinek ($11,410,692); Ms. McCarthy ($2,181,439); Dr. Paz ($1,185,174) and Mr. Soistman ($2,566,842). For Ms. McCarthy, Dr. Paz and
Mr. Soistman, the amounts exclude the portion of awards the executive is entitled to receive as a result of reaching retirement eligibility under the award
terms, regardless of the merger.

All of the unvested Aetna RSUs held by Aetna’s non-employee directors as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus will vest and be
settled prior to the assumed completion date of the merger, and the value of these awards is included for each non-employee director under “Vested
Equity Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers” above. At the close of business on February 5, 2018, the most recent practicable date for
which such information was available, each of Aetna’s non-employee directors held Aetna RSUs with respect to 1,203 Aetna common shares.

Deferred Compensation Programs

Aetna maintains nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements for its non-employee directors. Such directors may defer all or any portion of
their compensation for a given plan year. In the event of a change in control, a participating director will be entitled to a lump-sum cash payout of the
entire cash and stock balances, with the cash payout of the stock balance determined using Aetna’s fair market value on the effective date of the merger.

Aetna also permits executives to defer up to 100% of their annual bonus and such amounts may be invested in either an interest account or a stock
unit account, at the executive’s election. The arrangement pays out on a date selected by the executive at the time of deferral. Executives may also elect
to defer vested RSU and PSU awards, and such amounts pay out according to the award terms at the time of deferral.

The value of the vested deferred stock units for each non-employee director and Messrs. Bertolini and Soistman and Ms. McCarthy is included in
the applicable amounts disclosed under “Vested Equity Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers” above. No other executive officer has
deferred amounts under this arrangement.

Arrangements with CVS Health

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, none of Aetna’s executive officers has entered into any agreement with CVS Health or any
of its affiliates regarding employment or other compensation arrangements with the surviving corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or
following completion of the merger, however, some or all of Aetna’s executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with CVS Health or any of
its affiliates regarding employment or other compensation arrangements with the surviving corporation or one or more of its affiliates. In addition, as
described in more detail above, at completion of the merger, Mr. Bertolini and two other individuals who are serving on the Aetna board of directors
immediately prior to completion of the merger will fill newly created vacancies on the CVS Health board of directors and will receive compensation in
connection with their service on the same terms as other non-employee directors of CVS Health.

Table of Contents

Director and Officer Indemnification

Directors and executive officers of Aetna have rights to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that will survive
completion of the merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 201 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Mr. Bertolini’s Employment Agreement

Mr. Bertolini is party to an employment agreement with Aetna that provides that all of his unvested equity-based compensation outstanding at
completion of the merger will become immediately vested, nonforfeitable and exercisable. In addition, he is entitled to receive certain benefits if his
employment is involuntarily terminated by Aetna other than for Cause (as defined below) or due to his death or disability, or terminated by Mr. Bertolini
for Good Reason (as defined below), whether or not in connection with the merger, including: (i) 24 months of cash compensation, calculated as two
times the sum of (a) Mr. Bertolini’s highest annual base salary in effect during the six months prior to his termination and (b) his target annual cash
bonus opportunity (which equals 120% of his annual base salary then in effect) and (ii) a pro rata portion of his target cash bonus opportunity for the
year of termination (subject in certain circumstances to meeting applicable performance requirements). Such amounts are payable in equal installments
over two years following Mr. Bertolini’s termination of employment.

Under Mr. Bertolini’s employment agreement, “Cause” means the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (i) Mr. Bertolini’s willful and
continued failure to attempt in good faith to perform the duties of his position (other than as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness or
injury) which failure is not remedied within 15 business days of written notice from Aetna; (ii) Mr. Bertolini’s material gross negligence or willful
malfeasance in the performance of his duties under the employment agreement; (iii) with respect to Aetna, Mr. Bertolini’s commission of an act
constituting fraud, embezzlement, or any other act constituting a felony; or (iv) Mr. Bertolini’s commission of any act constituting a felony (other than a
speeding violation or by virtue of vicarious liability) which has or is likely to have a material adverse economic or reputational impact on Aetna;
provided that, no act or failure to act shall be deemed “willful” unless effected by Mr. Bertolini without reasonable belief that such action or failure to
act was lawful and in the best interests of Aetna.

Under Mr. Bertolini’s employment agreement, “Good Reason” means, without Mr. Bertolini’s express written consent, the occurrence of any one
or more of the following: (i) a reduction by Aetna of Mr. Bertolini’s annual base salary in effect immediately prior thereto or target cash bonus
opportunity, except in the event of a ratable reduction prior to a change in control (as defined in any plan in which Mr. Bertolini participates or in any
award that Mr. Bertolini has been given) affecting all senior officers of Aetna; (ii) within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in any
plan in which Mr. Bertolini participates or in any award that Mr. Bertolini has been given), a reduction in the level of Mr. Bertolini’s long-term incentive
plan opportunity from that afforded to him immediately prior to the change in control; (iii) any failure of a successor of Aetna to assume and agree to
perform Aetna’s entire obligations under the employment agreement; provided that such successor has received at least 10 days’ written notice from
Aetna or Mr. Bertolini of such requirements; (iv) a reporting relationship for Mr. Bertolini other than to Aetna’s Board of Directors; (v) any action or
inaction by Aetna that constitutes a material breach of the terms of the employment agreement; (vi) removal of Mr. Bertolini as President, Chief
Executive Officer, or director of Aetna other than in connection with the termination of his employment for Cause, provided, however, that if the failure
to be elected a director of Aetna by its shareholders is solely related to a regulatory requirement prohibiting Aetna executives from serving on Aetna’s
Board of Directors, then such failure to be elected shall not constitute “Good Reason”; or (vii) following the appointment of Mr. Bertolini as Chairman,
the appointment of any other person to the position of executive Chairman, it being understood and agreed that the appointment by Aetna of a
non-executive Chairman shall not constitute “Good Reason.”

Ms. Lynch’s Employment Agreement

Ms. Lynch is party to an employment agreement with Aetna that provides that she is entitled to receive certain benefits if her employment is
involuntarily terminated by Aetna other than for Cause (as defined below) or due to her death or disability, or terminated by Ms. Lynch for Good Reason
(as defined below), whether or not in connection with the merger, including: (i) 24 months of cash compensation, calculated as two times the sum of (a)
Ms. Lynch’s highest annual base salary in effect during the six months prior to her termination and (b) her target cash bonus opportunity for the year of
termination of employment (which equals at least 120% of her annual base salary) and (ii) a pro rata portion of her target cash bonus opportunity for the
year of termination of employment (subject in certain circumstances to meeting applicable performance requirements). Such amounts are payable in
equal installments over two years following Ms. Lynch’s termination of employment. In addition, upon a qualifying termination, Ms. Lynch will be
treated as retirement eligible for purposes of the vesting and exercise terms of all her outstanding equity awards.

Under Ms. Lynch’s employment agreement, “Cause” means the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (i) Ms. Lynch’s willful and
continued failure to attempt in good faith to perform the duties of her position (other than as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness or
injury) which failure is not remedied within 15 business days of written notice from Aetna; (ii) Ms. Lynch’s material gross negligence or willful
malfeasance in the performance of her duties under the employment agreement; (iii) with respect to Aetna, Ms. Lynch’s commission of an act
constituting fraud, embezzlement, or any other act constituting a felony; or (iv) Ms. Lynch’s commission of any act constituting a felony (other than a
speeding violation or by virtue of vicarious liability) which has or is likely to have a material adverse economic or reputational impact on Aetna;
provided that, no act or failure to act shall be deemed “willful” unless effected by Ms. Lynch without reasonable belief that such action or failure to act
was lawful and in the best interests of Aetna.

Under Ms. Lynch’s employment agreement, “Good Reason” means, without Ms. Lynch’s express written consent, the occurrence of any one or
more of the following: (i) a reduction by Aetna of Ms. Lynch’s annual base salary or target annual cash bonus opportunity from the level in effect
immediately prior thereto, except in the event of a ratable reduction affecting all senior officers of Aetna; (ii) any failure of a successor of Aetna to
assume and agree to perform Aetna’s entire obligations under the employment agreement; provided that such successor has received at least 10 days’
written notice from Aetna or Ms. Lynch of the requirement to do so under the employment agreement; (iii) Ms. Lynch reporting to any Aetna officer
other than Aetna’s Chief Executive Officer; (iv) removal of Ms. Lynch as President (other than in connection with a termination of Ms. Lynch’s
employment for Cause); and (v) any action or inaction by Aetna that constitutes a material breach of the terms of the employment agreement.

For the quantification of Ms. Lynch’s severance benefits assuming a termination of employment following the merger, see “—Quantification of
Potential Payments to Aetna Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 216 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Letter Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers

Messrs. Guertin, Loveman and Sabatino (Aetna’s other named executive officers, as defined below) are parties to letter agreements with Aetna
that provide for annual base salary continuation for 52 weeks on certain terminations of employment by Aetna in lieu of amounts payable under any
Aetna severance and salary continuation plan, whether or not in connection with the merger, as described below.

Under his letter agreement, Mr. Guertin is entitled to receive salary continuation payments if he is involuntarily terminated under circumstances
that would call for severance pay benefits and/or salary continuation benefits under any Aetna severance and salary continuation plan. While his letter
agreement provides for 52 weeks of base salary continuation, due to his tenure with Aetna, Mr. Guertin is entitled to 68 weeks of base salary
continuation under Aetna’s Job Elimination Benefits Plan (assuming seven years of service at completion of the merger) upon a termination following a
change in control, and the tables below reflect this higher value.

Table of Contents

Mr. Loveman is entitled to receive such payments if Aetna terminates his employment for reasons other than Cause or if he resigns because he is
required to report to an Aetna officer other than Aetna’s Chief Executive Officer. In the case of Mr. Loveman’s letter agreement, “Cause” means
Mr. Loveman’s: (i) willful failure to perform substantially his duties as an employee of Aetna (other than due to physical or mental illness) after
reasonable notice from Aetna; (ii) engagement in serious misconduct that is injurious to Aetna, any subsidiary or any affiliate, (iii) conviction of, or
entrance of a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony; (iv) breach of any written covenant or agreement not to compete with Aetna,
any subsidiary or any affiliate; or (v) breach of his duty of loyalty to Aetna which includes, without limitation: (a) disclosure by him of confidential
information pertaining to Aetna, any subsidiary or any affiliate; (b) harmful interference by him in the business or operations of Aetna, any subsidiary or
any affiliate; (c) an attempt by him to directly or indirectly induce any employee, insurance agent, insurance broker or broker-dealer of Aetna, any
subsidiary or any affiliate to be employed or perform services elsewhere; (d) an attempt by him, directly or indirectly, to solicit the trade of any customer
or supplier, or prospective customer or supplier, of Aetna to do business other than with Aetna; or (e) any breach or violation of Aetna’s code of conduct.

Mr. Sabatino is currently entitled to receive such payments if he is terminated for reasons other than Cause. In the case of Mr. Sabatino’s letter
agreement, “Cause” means: (i) his willful and material violation of any Aetna policies; (ii) his material and willful failure or refusal to perform any of
his duties or responsibilities to Aetna or any of its affiliates, in each case if and only if such failure or refusal is capable of cure and his failure or refusal
is not cured within 10 days following his receipt of written notice from Aetna specifying such failure or refusal; (iii) his failure to follow a lawful
instruction of Aetna if and only if such failure is capable of cure and his failure is not cured within 10 days following his receipt of written notice from
Aetna specifying such failure; or (iv) his commission of an act constituting a fraud, embezzlement or other act constituting a felony.

merger, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to Aetna Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 216 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Other Severance Arrangements with Executive Officers

Mr. Jelinek is party to a letter agreement with Aetna that provides, in lieu of amounts payable under any Aetna severance and salary continuation
benefits plan, that he is entitled to receive a cash severance amount equal to the sum of 52 weeks of his annual base salary and his target annual cash
bonus opportunity for the year of termination if his employment is terminated by Aetna other than for cause (which is undefined in the letter agreement)
or if he terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined below). Such amount is payable in equal installments over 52 weeks following
Mr. Jelinek’s termination of employment. In addition, Mr. Jelinek will be paid a cash lump sum pro rated target bonus for active service during the year
of termination within 45 days following his termination of employment. In the case of Mr. Jelinek’s letter agreement, “Good Reason” means:
(i) Mr. Jelinek no longer reports to the Chief Executive Officer of Aetna; (ii) a reduction by Aetna of his total annual target cash compensation from the
level in effect immediately prior thereto, except in the event of a ratable reduction affecting all senior officers of Aetna; or (iii) Mr. Jelinek’s principal
office location is required to be in a location other than the New York, NY metropolitan area. In addition, the “Good Reason” provision for Mr. Jelinek
was triggered when a prior acquisition did not close, and Mr. Jelinek may exercise this right until July 31, 2018, provided that he may not exercise this
right without Aetna’s consent prior to 120 days following the date he notifies Aetna.

Dr. Paz is party to a letter agreement with Aetna that provides that he is entitled to receive base salary continuation if his employment is
terminated by Aetna other than for cause (which is undefined in the letter agreement), whether or not in connection with the merger. While his letter
agreement provides for 52 weeks of base salary continuation, due to his tenure with Aetna, Dr. Paz is entitled to 56 weeks of base salary continuation
under Aetna’s Job Elimination Benefits Plan (assuming four years of service at completion of the merger) upon a termination following a change in
control, and the severance benefit amount below reflects this higher value.

Table of Contents

Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Soistman are not parties to letter agreements with Aetna that provide severance benefits, and instead are entitled to receive
severance benefits under Aetna’s Job Elimination Benefits Plan on certain terminations of employment by Aetna. Under the Job Elimination Benefits
Plan, upon a termination following a change in control, Ms. McCarthy is eligible to receive 100 weeks of base salary continuation (assuming 15 years of
service at completion of the merger) and Mr. Soistman is eligible to receive 60 weeks of base salary continuation (assuming five years of service at
completion of the merger), based on their current pay levels.

In addition, upon any termination of employment, all executive officers will continue to receive Aetna-provided benefits for nine weeks, and may
elect to continue coverage under Aetna’s medical plan at employee rates for an additional two months thereafter.

Assuming that all four of the executive officers who are not named executive officers experience a termination of employment immediately
following the assumed completion date of the merger that results in severance benefits pursuant to the letter agreements or Job Elimination Benefits
Plan, as applicable, the aggregate severance benefits to be paid or provided (including the value of continuing benefits) for each such executive officer
would be as follows: Mr. Jelinek ($1,684,714); Ms. McCarthy ($1,271,309); Dr. Paz ($780,277); and Mr. Soistman ($905,902).

Restrictive Covenants

Pursuant to the terms of their equity award agreements, each executive officer is subject to non-competition restrictions for 12 months following
termination of employment and non-solicitation of customers and employees restrictions for 24 months following termination of employment. These
restrictions are as strict as, or stricter than, the restrictive covenants in any other agreements between Aetna and its executive officers.

Annual Incentive Plans

The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the merger, Aetna will determine the performance under its annual incentive plans (as
defined in the merger agreement) through the date of completion and each participant will be eligible to earn (i) a pro-rated portion of his or her annual
incentive plan bonus based on actual performance through the date of completion of the merger and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the bonus with respect to
the portion of the year following the date of completion of the merger based on the participant’s target incentive level. Under the terms of Aetna’s
Amended and Restated 2001 Annual Incentive Plan, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Aetna’s 2001 Annual Incentive Plan,
an executive officer whose employment is terminated for any reason other than for cause (or any voluntary termination of employment) in connection
with completion of the merger will remain eligible to receive the payments described above for the full calendar year.

Assuming that the employment of all four of the executive officers who are not named executive officers is terminated immediately following the
assumed completion date of the merger, the aggregate value of the bonus paid for each such executive officer, assuming a target level of performance for
the portion of the year prior to the date of completion of the merger, would be approximately: Mr. Jelinek ($880,000); Ms. McCarthy ($594,000);
Dr. Paz ($576,800); and Mr. Soistman ($781,000).

For information on the bonus paid for the named executive officers, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to Aetna Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 216 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

280G Mitigation Payments

Pursuant to its authority under the merger agreement, and in order to mitigate the impact of Section 4999 of the Code, Aetna’s compensation
committee elected on December 19, 2017 to accelerate to December 27, 2017,

Table of Contents

the vesting of certain Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs held by Messrs. Jelinek and Loveman and certain Aetna RSUs held by Mr. Sabatino. The accelerated
Aetna RSUs and Aetna PSUs were originally scheduled to vest during 2018. Because these equity awards would have vested prior to the assumed
completion date of the merger under their original terms, they have been included in the amounts described under “—Vested Equity Interests of Aetna’s
Directors and Executive Officers” above.

Quantification of Potential Payments to Aetna Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of Aetna’s five named executive officers estimates of the
amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger and that will or may become payable to the named executive officer either
immediately at completion of the merger (i.e., on a “single trigger” basis) or on a qualifying termination of employment following the merger (i.e., on a
“double trigger” basis).

For the purposes of the disclosure in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Aetna’s named executive officers are determined in accordance with
Item 402(3)(a) of Regulation S-K with respect to Aetna’s most recent annual proxy statement. Accordingly, the named executive officers are (i) Mark T.
Bertolini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Aetna’s Principal Executive Officer), (ii) Shawn M. Guertin, Executive Vice President, Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Enterprise Risk Officer (Aetna’s Principal Financial Officer), and (iii) Gary W. Loveman, Executive Vice President,
Consumer Health and Services, Karen S. Lynch, President, and Thomas J. Sabatino, Jr., Executive Vice President and General Counsel, who were each
of Aetna’s three other highest compensated executive officers serving at December 31, 2016.

On January 25, 2018, Aetna announced that Mr. Loveman will be leaving the company. Because Mr. Loveman’s last day of employment and the
terms of any additional agreement between him and Aetna have not been agreed upon as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the values
of Mr. Loveman’s equity interests and severance benefits have been calculated based on the terms of his arrangements as in effect as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus in the same manner as Aetna’s other named executive officers.

Aetna shareholders are being asked to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation for these named executive officers specified
in the table below (see “Aetna Proposal III: Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 220 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus). Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Aetna or CVS
Health. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted by Aetna’s shareholders and the merger is completed, the compensation will be
payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in
the footnotes to the table and above under “Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 209 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.

Aetna continuously monitors its executive compensation programs and, from time to time, has made modifications to ensure they are consistent
with its philosophy and within the bounds of the competitive marketplace. Aetna believes that the potential cost of the change in control benefits
described in the table below is necessary to retain the employees needed to complete the merger.

Table of Contents

The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable assuming that a qualifying termination of each named executive
officer’s employment occurs immediately following the assumed completion date of the merger. These estimates are based on multiple assumptions that
may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Certain information is not currently available and thus
is not included in the table below, such as equity grants in the ordinary course of business to the extent permitted under the merger agreement between
the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the assumed completion date of the merger, and, as a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be
received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.
 

Name   Cash(1)    Equity(2)    Benefits(3)   Total

Thomas J. Sabatino, Jr.    750,000    750,000    1,500,000 

 

 
(a) For Mr. Bertolini and Ms. Lynch, the severance payment is based on 24 months of his or her cash compensation (calculated as annual base

salary and target cash bonus opportunity). For Mr. Guertin, the severance amount is based on 68 weeks of his annual base salary. For
Messrs. Loveman and Sabatino, the severance payment is based on 52 weeks of his annual base salary.

 
(b) Reflects each named executive officer’s annual incentive plan bonus for the full year of closing pursuant to the terms of the 2001 Annual

Incentive Plan, assuming a target level of performance for the portion of the year prior to the date of completion of the merger.
 

(2) Equity: The amounts in this column reflect the value of the accelerated vesting of unvested equity awards that would occur upon completion of
the merger and upon a qualifying termination of employment within 24 months following completion of the merger. The assumed per-share value
of Aetna common shares for purposes of determining the values in this column is $205.03. This value is calculated based on a price of a share of
CVS Health common stock of $71.65, which, as required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, is the average closing price of a share of CVS Health
common stock over the five business day period following the first public announcement of the merger agreement. For Mr. Bertolini, the amounts
exclude the portion of awards he is entitled to receive as a result of reaching retirement eligibility under the award terms,

(a) Aetna PSUs held by Aetna’s named executive officers will be earned either at target or higher actual performance as of the date of
completion of the merger, depending on the applicable terms and the ability of Aetna to determine actual performance as of completion of
the merger. Because actual performance is not measurable at this time, this disclosure assumes target performance through the date of the
applicable named executive officer’s termination.

 

(3) Benefits: The estimated amounts in this column reflect the value of the continuation of health, dental and vision insurance under the plans and
programs in which the named executive officer currently participates for a period of nine weeks following termination and the value of continued
coverage under Aetna’s medical plan at employee rates for an additional two months thereafter.

AETNA PROPOSAL II: ADJOURNMENT OF THE AETNA SPECIAL MEETING

Aetna shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give Aetna’s board of directors authority to adjourn the Aetna special meeting
one or more times if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
Aetna special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If this proposal is approved, the Aetna special meeting could be adjourned to any
date. Any determination of whether it is necessary to adjourn the Aetna special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) to solicit
additional proxies will be made solely by Aetna consistent with the terms of the merger agreement or with the consent of CVS Health.

If the Aetna special meeting is adjourned, Aetna shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time
prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in
favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on the Aetna adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in
favor of the Aetna adjournment proposal. But if you indicate that you wish to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, your
shares will only be voted in favor of the Aetna adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Aetna special meeting by Aetna shareholders will be required to approve the Aetna
adjournment proposal.

Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote “FOR” the Aetna adjournment proposal.

AETNA PROPOSAL III: ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

Aetna is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation that will or may be
paid or provided by Aetna to its named executive officers in connection with the merger, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

The compensation that Aetna’s named executive officers may be entitled to receive from Aetna in connection with the merger is summarized in
the table under “Interests of Aetna’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments to Aetna Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 216 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. That summary includes all compensation and
benefits that will or may be paid or provided by Aetna to its named executive officers in connection with the merger, including as a result of a
termination of employment in connection with the merger.

Aetna’s board of directors encourages you to review carefully the information regarding the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Aetna to its named executive officers in connection with the merger disclosed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Aetna approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Aetna approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may be paid or provided
by Aetna to its named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the Golden Parachute
Compensation table and the related narrative disclosures.”

The vote on the Aetna compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement. Accordingly, you may vote for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and vote against the Aetna compensation advisory
proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Aetna compensation advisory proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Aetna or CVS
Health. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation payments that are contractually
required to be paid by Aetna to its named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the
outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of Aetna shareholders.

A majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the proposal at the Aetna special meeting will be required to approve, on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

Aetna’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Aetna shareholders vote “FOR” the Aetna compensation advisory proposal.

CVS HEALTH PROPOSAL II: ADJOURNMENT OF THE CVS HEALTH SPECIAL MEETING

CVS Health stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give CVS Health’s board of directors authority to adjourn the CVS
Health special meeting one or more times if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the CVS Health special
meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, to approve the stock issuance. If this proposal is approved, the CVS Health special meeting could
be adjourned to any date. Any determination of whether it is necessary to adjourn the CVS Health special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof) to solicit additional proxies will be made solely by CVS Health consistent with the terms of the merger agreement or with the consent of Aetna.

If the CVS Health special meeting is adjourned, CVS Health stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at
any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to

reissued in the same manner as other authorized but unissued shares.

CVS Health Common Stock

The holders of shares of CVS Health common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters voted on by stockholders, including elections
of directors. Except as otherwise required by law, or by the provisions of the preferred stock or the preference stock, or provided in any resolution
adopted by the CVS Health board with respect to any subsequently created class or series of CVS Health shares, the holders of the shares of CVS Health
common stock exclusively possess all voting power. CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation precludes cumulative voting in the election of directors.

contested elections of directors. Subject to any rights of any outstanding series of CVS Health preferred shares, the holders of shares of CVS Health
common stock (i) are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the CVS Health board from funds available therefor, (ii) no
dividends may be declared, paid, or set aside for payment on shares of CVS Health common stock unless full cumulative dividends are paid on any

Health common stock is Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the CVS Health transfer agent
and registrar. It is a condition to the merger that the shares of CVS Health common stock issuable in the merger be approved for listing on the NYSE on
or before the effective time of the merger, subject to official notice of issuance. If the merger is completed, Aetna common shares will cease to be listed
on the NYSE.

No Preemptive Rights

Book-Entry Shareholding

Certificates representing the shares of CVS Health common stock will not be issued unless requested in writing or otherwise required under
applicable law. Holders of record of shares of CVS Health common stock have credited to a book-entry account established for them by, and maintained
at, the CVS Health transfer agent and registrar the number of shares of CVS Health common stock owned by them. Each holder of record receives an
ownership statement from the CVS Health transfer agent and registrar promptly following each transfer to or from such account. CVS Health
stockholders may request the issuance of a certificate representing the shares of CVS Health common stock owned of record by them by writing to the
CVS Health transfer agent and registrar.

CVS Preferred Stock and Preference Stock

As of February 5, 2018, the CVS Health record date, no shares of CVS Health preferred stock or preference stock were issued and outstanding.

Potential Issuances of CVS Health Preferred Stock and Preference Stock

As of February 5, 2018, CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation authorized 120,619 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share and
50,000,000 shares of preference stock, par value $1.00 per share. CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation also authorizes the CVS Health board of
directors to issue shares of preferred stock or preference stock, from time to time, in such class or classes, and such series within any class, and such
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as the board
may determine, including, for example, (i) the designation of the class or series; (ii) the number of shares of the class or series, which number the CVS
Health board of directors may thereafter (except where otherwise provided in the designation of any subsequently authorized class or series) increase or
decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding); (iii) whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative and the
dividend rate of the class or series; (iv) the dates on which dividends, if any, will be payable; (v) the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for
shares of the class or series; (vi) the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the class or series;
(vii) the amounts payable on shares of the class or series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of CVS Health; (viii) whether the shares of the class or series will be convertible into shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of CVS
Health or any other corporation, and, if so, the specification of such other class or series or such other security, the conversion price or prices or rate or
rates, any adjustments thereof, the date or dates as of which such shares will be convertible and all other terms and conditions upon which such
conversion may be made; (ix) restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same class or series or of any other class or series; and (x) the voting rights, if
any, of the holders of such class or series. The authorized capital stock of CVS Health, including preferred stock, preference stock and common stock,
will be available for issuance without further action by CVS Health stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any
stock exchange or automated quotation system on which CVS Health’s securities may be listed or traded. If the approval of CVS Health stockholders is
not so required, the CVS Health board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval.

Although the CVS Health board of directors has no intention at the present time of doing so, it could issue a class or series of CVS Health
preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such class or series, impede completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt that
some, or a majority, of CVS Health stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their
shares over the then-current market price of such shares.

Potential Issuances of Rights to Purchase Securities

CVS Health does not currently have a stockholder rights plan, although the CVS Health board of directors retains the right to adopt a new plan at
a future date. CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation grants the CVS

Health board of directors exclusive authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase from CVS Health shares of capital stock
or other securities and to elect to repurchase, redeem, terminate or amend any such rights. The times at which and terms upon which such rights are to be
issued, repurchased, redeemed, terminated or amended are to be determined exclusively by the CVS Health board of directors and set forth in the
contracts or instruments that evidence any such rights. The authority of the CVS Health board of directors with respect to such rights includes
determining, for example, (i) the purchase price of the capital stock or other securities or property to be purchased upon exercise of such rights;
(ii) provisions relating to the times at which and the circumstances under which such rights may be exercised or sold or otherwise transferred, either
together with or separately from any other shares or other securities of CVS Health; (iii) provisions which adjust the number or exercise price of such
rights or the amount or nature of the shares, other securities or other property receivable upon exercise of such rights in the event of a combination, split
or recapitalization of any shares of CVS Health, a change in ownership of CVS Health’s shares or other securities or a reorganization, merger,
consolidation, sale of assets or other occurrence relating to CVS Health or any shares of CVS Health, and provisions restricting the ability of CVS
Health to enter into any such transaction absent an assumption by the other party or parties thereto of the obligations of CVS Health under such rights;
(iv) provisions which deny the holder of a specified percentage of the outstanding securities of CVS Health the right to exercise such rights and/or cause
such rights held by such holder to become void; (v) provisions which permit CVS Health to redeem or exchange such rights; and (vi) the appointment of
the rights agent with respect to such rights. This provision is intended to confirm the CVS Health board of directors exclusive authority to issue,
repurchase, redeem, terminate or amend share purchase rights or other rights to purchase shares or securities of CVS Health or any other corporation.

Stockholder Action by Written Consent

CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation provides that stockholder action may be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by
written consent in lieu of a meeting, but only if such action is taken in accordance with the provisions of CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation and
by-laws. Any person other than CVS Health seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting are
required to deliver a written notice signed by holders of record of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock
of CVS Health entitled to express consent on the relevant action and request that a record date be fixed for such purpose.

Provisions Relating to Amendments to CVS Health’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws

Under Delaware law, stockholders have the right to adopt, amend or repeal the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of a corporation. However,
Delaware law requires that any amendment to CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation also be approved by the board of directors. Under Delaware law,
unless a higher vote is required in a corporation’s certificate of incorporation, amendments to the corporation’s certificate of incorporation will be
adopted upon receiving at a properly convened meeting the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all stockholders entitled to vote thereon,
and if any class or series is entitled to vote thereon as a class, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each class vote.

In addition, CVS Health’s by-laws may be amended by the board of directors with respect to all matters not exclusively reserved by law to the
stockholders. Amendments to CVS Health’s by-laws may be adopted and approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of a majority of the
outstanding shares of stock of CVS Health entitled to vote cast at any annual or special meeting, or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors
cast at any regular or special meeting at which a quorum is present.

Under CVS Health’s by-laws, the name of CVS Health can only be changed by a vote of at least three fourths of the members of the board of
directors of CVS Health and any amendment to such provision in CVS Health’s by-laws must also be approved by a vote of at least three fourths of the
members of the board of directors.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

The rights of CVS Health stockholders are currently governed by Delaware law and CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws. The
rights of Aetna shareholders are currently governed by Pennsylvania law and Aetna’s articles of incorporation and by-laws. Following completion of the
merger, the rights of Aetna shareholders who become stockholders of CVS Health in the merger will be governed by Delaware law and CVS Health’s
certificate of incorporation and CVS Health’s by-laws.

The following discussion summarizes the material differences between the current rights of Aetna shareholders and the current rights of CVS
Health stockholders. These differences arise in part from differences between Delaware law and Pennsylvania law. Additional differences arise from the
governing instruments of the two companies.

Although it is impracticable to compare all of the aspects in which Delaware law and Pennsylvania law and CVS Health’s and Aetna’s governing
instruments differ with respect to stockholder rights, the following discussion summarizes certain material differences between them. This summary is
not intended to be complete, and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to Delaware law, Pennsylvania law, CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation
and by-laws and Aetna’s articles of incorporation and by-laws. In addition, the identification of some of the differences in the rights of these
stockholders as material is not intended to indicate that other differences that are equally important do not exist. CVS Health and Aetna urge you to
carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, the relevant provisions of Delaware law and Pennsylvania law and the other documents to
which CVS Health and Aetna refer in this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete understanding of the differences between the rights of a
CVS Health stockholder and the rights of an Aetna shareholder. CVS Health and Aetna have filed with the SEC their respective governing documents
referenced in this comparison of stockholder rights and will send copies of these documents to you, without charge, upon your written or telephonic
request. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 254 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

of common stock, par value $0.01 per share and
(ii) 120,619 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share and (iii) 50,000,000 shares of
preference stock, par value $1.00 per share.   

As of February 5, 2018, the authorized capital stock

shares, par value $0.01 per share, (ii) 7,625,000
Class A voting preferred shares, par value $0.01 per

relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof as the CVS Health board of directors may
determine.   

The Aetna board of directors is authorized to provide
for the issuance of shares of Aetna capital stock in

   CVS Health Stockholder Rights   Aetna Shareholder Rights

  

As of February 5, 2018, there were outstanding
(i) 1,015,460,751 shares of CVS Health common
stock (ii) no shares of CVS Health preferred stock
and (iii) no shares of CVS Health preference stock.   

As of February 5, 2018, there were outstanding (i)
326,942,525 Aetna common shares and (ii) no Aetna
Class A voting preferred shares.

Number of Directors
  

CVS Health’s board of directors currently has 12
members.   

The Aetna board of directors currently has 12
members.

  

Under CVS Health’s by-laws, the number of
directors constituting the whole board of directors is
fixed by resolution of the board of directors and must
consist of not fewer than three nor more than 18
members.   

Under Aetna’s by-laws, the Aetna board of directors
must consist of not fewer than three nor more than
21 members.

  

Delaware law permits classified boards of directors.
CVS Health’s by-laws and CVS Health’s certificate
of incorporation do not provide for a classified board
of directors.   

Pennsylvania law permits classified boards of
directors, but Aetna does not have one.

Election of Directors

  

Under Delaware law, directors are elected annually.
CVS Health’s by-laws provide for a majority vote
standard for uncontested elections of directors and a
plurality of votes standard for contested elections of
directors. Under CVS Health’s by-laws, a majority of
votes cast means that the number of votes “for” a
director’s election must exceed fifty percent (50%)
of the votes cast with respect to that director’s
election. Votes “against” a director’s election will
count as votes cast, but “abstentions” and “broker
non-votes” will not count as votes cast with respect
to that director’s election.

  

Aetna’s articles provide for a majority vote standard
for uncontested elections of directors and a plurality
of votes standard for contested elections of directors.
Under Pennsylvania law and Aetna’s articles, if an
incumbent director nominee does not receive a
majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election,
the incumbent director will continue to serve on the
board of directors until his or her successor is elected
and qualified. To address this situation, Aetna’s
corporate governance guidelines require any
incumbent nominee for director in an uncontested
election who receives more “against” votes than
“for” votes to promptly submit his or her resignation
for consideration by the Aetna board of directors’
nominating committee.

Removal of Directors

  

Under Delaware law, directors may be removed with
or without cause by the affirmative vote of holders of
a majority of all the shares of stock outstanding and
entitled to vote for the election of directors.

  

Pennsylvania law provides that, unless otherwise
provided in a by-law adopted by the shareholders, in
the absence of cumulative voting or a classified
board of directors, any director may be removed with
or without cause by a vote of

classified board of directors.

Voting

  

Under Delaware law and CVS Health’s certificate of
incorporation, each holder of CVS Health common
stock is entitled to one vote per share of CVS Health
common stock.

  

Under Aetna’s articles, each holder of Aetna
common shares is entitled to one vote per Aetna
common share, and each holder of an Aetna Class A
voting preferred share is entitled to 100 votes per
Aetna Class A voting preferred share. The holders of
Aetna common shares and Aetna Class A voting
preferred shares vote together as a single class on all
matters submitted to a vote of Aetna shareholders.
No Aetna Class A voting preferred shares are
currently outstanding.

Under Delaware law, CVS Health stockholders are
not entitled to cumulative voting unless it is
expressly provided for in the certificate of
incorporation. CVS Health’s certificate of
incorporation does not provide for cumulative
voting.   

Pennsylvania law allows for cumulative voting, but
Aetna’s articles expressly preclude it in the election
of directors.

Vacancies on the Board of Directors

  

Under Delaware law and CVS Health’s by-laws,
vacancies in the CVS Health board of directors, from
any cause whatsoever, including vacancies created
by an increase in the number of directors, shall be
filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining
directors, even if less than a quorum.

  

Under Aetna’s by-laws, vacancies on the board of
directors may be filled by a majority vote of the
remaining directors, regardless of how the vacancy
was created. Shareholders may fill vacancies on the
board of directors, regardless of how the vacancy
was created, only if and when authorized by
resolution of the Aetna board of directors.

Special Meeting of the Board of
Directors

  

Under CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation and
by-laws, special meetings of the CVS Health board
of directors may be called only by the chairman of
the CVS Health board of directors, the chief
executive officer or by one-third of the directors then
in office.   

Under Aetna’s by-laws, special meetings of the
board of directors may be called by the Chairman of
the board of directors, the President, the Lead
Director or not less than one-third of the directors
then in office.

Stockholder Action by Written
Consent

and by-laws, any action that could be taken at a
stockholder meeting can be taken without a meeting,
upon the written consent of the holders of the
outstanding stock having at least the minimum
number of votes that would have been necessary to
authorize the action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote were present and voted. Under CVS
Health’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, any
stockholder of record seeking to have the
stockholders authorize or take corporate action by
written consent must, by written notice to the
secretary, request the CVS Health board of directors
to fix a record date to determine the stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting. The CVS Health board of
directors must promptly, but in all events within ten
days after the date on which such a request is
received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date,
which date may not be more than ten days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted by the CVS Health board of directors. If
no record date is fixed by the CVS Health board of
directors within such period, the record date will be
the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is delivered to CVS Health.   

or special meeting and not by written consent.

Amendment to Certificate of
Incorporation

  

Under Delaware law, an amendment to CVS Health’s
certificate of incorporation generally requires (i) the
approval of the CVS Health board of directors,
(ii) the approval of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding stock entitled to vote upon the
proposed amendment and (iii) the approval of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding stock of each
class entitled to vote thereon as a class, if any. Under
CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation, CVS
Health reserves the right to amend its certificate of
incorporation in any manner permitted by Delaware
law and, with the sole exception of the rights and
powers   

Under Pennsylvania law, unless a greater vote is
required by Aetna’s articles, an amendment to
Aetna’s articles can be proposed by a resolution by
Aetna’s board of directors and then approved by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all
shareholders entitled to vote thereon and the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in any
required class vote, except for amendments on
certain specified matters that do not require
shareholder approval. Aetna’s articles require that an
amendment changing the vote required to approve a

director, except for liability for: (i) any breach of the
director’s duty of loyalty to such corporation or its
stockholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law; (iii) willful or negligent
violation of provisions of Delaware law governing
payment of dividends and stock purchases or
redemptions; (iv) any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit; or
(v) any act or omission before the adoption of such a
provision in the certificate of incorporation.
 
Under CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation,
directors are not personally liable to CVS Health or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director as a director to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware law.   

Aetna’s articles provide that no directors or officers
of Aetna will have personal liability to Aetna or its
shareholders for monetary damages (other than under
criminal statutes and under federal, state and local
laws imposing liability on directors for the payment
of taxes) unless the person’s conduct constitutes self-
dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.
 
If Pennsylvania law is amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors or officers, the liability
of directors or officers of Aetna will be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by
Pennsylvania law, as amended.

Indemnification of Directors,
Officers Employees and Agents

  

Under CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation,
CVS Health will indemnify and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, any person

Under Aetna’s articles, Aetna will indemnify its
directors and officers and advance expenses (upon

CVS Health or is or was serving at the request of
CVS Health as a director or officer of another

CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation also
includes the right to be paid by CVS Health the
expenses incurred in connection with any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the
fullest extent authorized by Delaware law. The right
to indemnification conferred in CVS Health’s
certificate of incorporation is a contract right.
 
Additionally, under CVS Health’s certificate of
incorporation, CVS Health’s board of directors
provides indemnification to such of the employees
and agents of CVS Health to such extent and to such
effect as the CVS Health board of directors
determines to be appropriate and authorized by

action of Aetna’s board of directors, indemnification
and advancement of expenses to its employees and
agents as determined by the Aetna board of directors.

Appraisal Rights or Dissenters’
Rights

  

Under Delaware law, stockholders of a Delaware
corporation have the right in certain mergers or
consolidations to which the corporation is a party, to
demand payment for the fair value of their shares
pursuant to, and in compliance with procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, except in
connection with a merger or consolidation with
respect to shares (i) listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders and (ii) for which, pursuant to the plan of
merger or consolidation, stockholders will receive
only (a) shares or depository   

Under Pennsylvania law, unless the articles or
by-laws provide otherwise, shareholders of a
Pennsylvania corporation generally are not entitled
to dissenters’ rights if the shares that would
otherwise give rise to such rights are (i) listed on a
national securities exchange or (ii) held beneficially
or of record by more than 2,000 persons.
 
Neither Aetna’s articles nor Aetna’s by-laws contain
provisions in this regard.

receipts of another corporation which at the date the
merger or consolidation is completed will be either
listed on a national securities exchange or held of
record by more than 2,000 holders, (b) shares of
stock or depositary receipts of the surviving
corporation in the merger or consolidation, (c) cash
in lieu of fractional shares or (d) any combination of
the foregoing. Delaware law also provides that,
subject to certain exceptions, stockholders of a
surviving corporation do not have appraisal rights in
connection with a plan of merger if the merger did
not require for its approval the vote of the surviving
corporation’s stockholders. Delaware law permits the
certificate of incorporation of a Delaware
corporation to provide for appraisal rights in mergers
or consolidations in which appraisal rights are not
otherwise available and in connection with
amendments to the certificate of incorporation and
sales of all or substantially all assets. CVS Health’s
certificate of incorporation contains no provisions
giving rise to appraisal rights in such transactions.
 
Additionally, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
if immediately before a merger or consolidation the
shares of a class or series of stock of a corporation as
to which appraisal rights are available were listed on
a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of
Chancery must dismiss an appraisal proceeding as to
all stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless
(i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or
series eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or
consolidation for such total number of shares seeking
appraisal exceeds $1 million, or (iii) the merger was
approved pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267 of
the DGCL.

At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to
each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in
cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as
provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and
the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time.   

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

  

Under CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation and
by-laws, subject to the preferential rights of any
holders of outstanding preferred stock or preference
stock, holders of CVS Health common stock are
entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by law,
such dividends as the CVS Health board of directors
may declare from time to time from funds available
therefor.   

Subject to any rights of any outstanding series of
Aetna shares senior to the Aetna common shares, the
holders of Aetna common shares are entitled to such
dividends as may be declared from time to time by
the Aetna board of directors from funds available
therefor.

Stockholder Vote on Fundamental or
Extraordinary Corporate
Transactions

  

Under Delaware law, a sale, lease or exchange of all
or substantially all of a corporation’s assets, an
amendment to CVS Health’s certificate of
incorporation, a merger or consolidation of a
corporation with another corporation or a dissolution
of a corporation generally requires the affirmative
vote of CVS Health’s board of directors and, with
limited exceptions, the affirmative vote of a majority
of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding
stock entitled to vote on the transaction.
 
With respect to transactions with related persons
(persons who own at least 10% of the outstanding

corporation, a plan of interest exchange, division or
voluntary dissolution will be adopted upon receiving
at a properly convened meeting the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders
entitled to vote thereon and the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast in any required class vote.

State Anti-Takeover Provisions

  

CVS Health has not opted out of Section 203 of the
DGCL, which provides that, if a person acquires
15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a
Delaware corporation, thereby becoming an
“interested stockholder”, that person may not engage
in certain “business combinations” with the
corporation, including mergers, purchases and sales
of 10% or more of its assets, stock purchases and
other transactions pursuant to which the percentage
of the corporation’s stock owned by the interested
stockholder increases (other than on a pro rata basis)
or pursuant to which the interested stockholder
receives a financial benefit from the corporation, for
a period of three years after becoming an interested
stockholder unless one of the following exceptions
applies: (i) the CVS Health board of directors
approved the acquisition of stock pursuant to which
the person became an interested stockholder or the
transaction that resulted in the person becoming an
interested stockholder prior to the time that the
person

  

Under Aetna’s articles, Aetna has expressly opted
out of the protection provided pursuant to
Subchapter G of Chapter 25 of the PBCL, which
would otherwise block the voting rights of an
acquiring person who makes or proposes to make a
control-share acquisition, which is defined as
increasing ownership in the corporation above
certain thresholds. In opting out of Subchapter G of
Chapter 25 of the PBCL, Aetna also opted out of
Subchapter I of Chapter 25 (providing for a
minimum severance payment to certain employees
terminated within two years of the approval of a
control-share acquisition) and Subchapter J of
Chapter 25 (prohibiting, in connection with certain
“control-share acquisitions,” the abrogation of
certain labor contracts, if any, prior to their stated
date of expiration).
 
Aetna has opted out of Subchapter H of Chapter 25
of the PBCL, which would otherwise enable Aetna
to recover certain profits from the sale of shares by
shareholders who hold or

consummation of the transaction that resulted in the
person becoming an interested stockholder such
person owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting
stock of the corporation, excluding, for purposes of
determining the voting stock outstanding, voting
stock owned by directors who are also officers and
certain employee stock plans; or (iii) the transaction
is approved by the CVS Health board of directors
and by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the
interested stockholder. An “interested stockholder”
also includes the affiliates and associates of a 15% or
more owner and any affiliate or associate of the
corporation who was the owner of 15% or more of
the outstanding voting stock within the three-year
period prior to determine whether a person is an
interested stockholder.

  

will hold 20% of the voting power of Aetna or who
have evidenced an intent to acquire control of Aetna.
 
Aetna has opted out of Subchapter E of Chapter 25
of the PBCL, which would otherwise subject persons
who acquire at least 20% of the voting power in a
“control transaction” to an obligation to pay
objecting shareholders fair value for their shares
(including a proportionate amount of any control
premium), determined as provided in Section 2547
of the PBCL.
 
Aetna has not opted out of Subchapter F of Chapter
25 of the PBCL (which Subchapter is referred to in
this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Subchapter F), which applies to a transaction
between a publicly traded corporation and an
interested shareholder (defined generally to be any
beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s
voting shares). Subchapter F prohibits such a
corporation from engaging in a “business
combination” (as defined in the PBCL) with an
“interested shareholder” (as defined in the PBCL)
unless (i) the board of directors of such corporation
gives approval to the proposed transaction or gives
approval to the interested shareholder’s acquisition
of shares that gave such person beneficial ownership
of 20% of the shares entitled to vote in an election of
directors of such corporation, in either case prior to
the date on which the shareholder first becomes an
interested shareholder (which date is referred to in
this section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as the share acquisition date), (ii) the interested
shareholder owns at least 80% of the shares of such
corporation entitled to vote in an election of directors
and, no earlier than three months after such
interested shareholder reaches such 80% level, the
holders of a majority of the

remaining shares approve the proposed transaction
and shareholders receive a minimum “fair price” for
their shares (as set forth in the PBCL) in the

are met, (iii) holders of all outstanding common
shares approve the transaction, (iv) no earlier than
five years after the share acquisition date, a majority
of the shares held by shareholders other than the
interested shareholder and entitled to vote in an

acquisition date, a majority of all the shares approve
the transaction, all shareholders receive a minimum
“fair price” for their shares (as set forth in the PBCL)
and the other conditions of Subchapter F are met.

Stockholder Rights Plan

  

While Delaware law does not include a statutory
provision expressly authorizing stockholder rights
plans, such rights plans have generally been found to
be authorized by Delaware law and have been upheld
by Delaware courts where they are adopted in
response to a reasonably perceived threat to CVS
Health and its stockholders, and maintaining such
rights plans in response to such threat has been found
to be reasonable in relation to the threat posed.
 
CVS Health does not currently have a stockholder
rights plan, but CVS Health’s board of directors has
the power under Delaware law and its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws to adopt a stockholder
rights plan in the future, subject to its fiduciary
duties.
 
CVS Health’s by-laws provide that, unless ratified
by the stockholders of CVS Health, any stockholder
rights plan (i) requires the approval of 3/4 of   

Pennsylvania law expressly authorizes a corporation
to adopt a shareholder rights plan.
 
Aetna currently has no shareholder rights plan.
While Aetna has no present intention to adopt a
shareholder rights plan, the Aetna board of directors
retains the right to adopt such a plan at a future date
pursuant to its exclusive authority to create and issue
rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase from
Aetna shares of capital stock or other securities and
to elect to repurchase, redeem, terminate or amend
any such rights.

the CVS Health board of directors and (ii) expires if
not so amended no later than one year following the
later of the date of its adoption and the date of its last
such amendment.   

Preemptive Rights

  

Under Delaware law, stockholders of a corporation
do not have preemptive rights to subscribe for or
purchase any additional issue of stock or to any
security convertible into such stock, unless such
right is expressly included in the certificate of
incorporation.
 
CVS Health’s certificate of incorporation does not
provide holders of shares of CVS Health capital
stock with preemptive rights.   

Aetna’s articles provide that no holder of any class or
series of Aetna capital stock will have any
preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any
shares of Aetna or any security convertible into
Aetna shares of any class or series.

Duties of Directors

  

Under Delaware law, the standards of conduct for
directors of corporations are not statutory but are
based on fiduciary duty principles developed by the
Delaware courts. Generally, directors of Delaware
corporations are subject to a duty of loyalty and a
duty of care. The duty of loyalty requires directors to
act with the sole purpose of advancing the best
interests of the corporation and its stockholders and
the duty of care requires directors in managing the
corporation’s affairs to use the level of care that
ordinarily careful and prudent persons would use in
similar circumstances. Directors owe fiduciary duties
of loyalty and care to the corporation and its
stockholders. Fiduciary duties are not owed to
non-stockholder constituencies such as customers
and employees.

  

Under Pennsylvania law, the standard of conduct for
directors is governed by statute and case law.
Pennsylvania law requires that a director of a
Pennsylvania corporation perform his or her duties:
(i) in good faith, (ii) in a manner he or she
reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the
corporation, and (iii) with such care, including
reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of
ordinary prudence would use under similar
circumstances.
 
In discharging their duties, directors may, in
considering the best interests of their corporation,
consider, among other things, to the extent they
deem appropriate: (a) the effects of any action upon
any or all groups affected by the action, including
shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and
creditors of the corporation, and upon communities
in which offices or other establishments of the
corporation are located; (b) the short-term and long-
term interests of the corporation; (c) the resources,
intent and conduct (past, stated and potential) of any
person seeking to acquire control of the corporation;
and (d) all other pertinent factors. In considering the

incorporated by reference herein. Such consolidated financial statements and CVS Health management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 are incorporated by reference herein in reliance upon such reports given on the authority of

limited nature of the review procedures applied. Ernst & Young LLP is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act for their
reports on the unaudited interim financial information because those reports are not “reports” or “parts” of the registration statement prepared or

the attached exhibits and schedules, contains additional relevant information about CVS Health and the shares of CVS Health common stock. The rules
and regulations of the SEC allow CVS Health and Aetna to omit certain information included in the registration statement from this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

CVS Health and Aetna file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy
this information at the SEC’s Public Reference Room, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further
information on the operation of the Public Reference Room. The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy statements and other
information about CVS Health and Aetna. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov. The reports and other information filed by CVS Health and
Aetna with the SEC are also available at their respective websites, which are http://www.cvshealth.com and http://www.aetna.com. Information on these
websites is not part of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The SEC allows CVS Health and Aetna to “incorporate by reference” information into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This means that
important information can be disclosed to you by referring you to another document filed separately with the SEC. The information incorporated by
reference is deemed to be part of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, except for any information superseded by information in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or in later filed documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This joint proxy
statement/prospectus incorporates by reference the documents set forth below that CVS Health and Aetna have, respectively, previously filed with the
SEC and any additional documents that either company may file with the SEC under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act between the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the respective dates of the Aetna and CVS Health special meetings (other than, in each case, those
documents, or the portions of those documents or exhibits thereto, deemed to be furnished and not filed in accordance with SEC rules). These
documents contain important information about CVS Health and Aetna and their respective financial performance.
