PROPOSED MERGER OF
CAROLINA FINANCIAL CORPORATION

AND FIRST SOUTH BANCORP, INC.
 

The board of directors of Carolina Financial Corporation (“Carolina Financial”) is furnishing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the accompanying form of proxy to Carolina Financial stockholders to solicit proxies to vote at a special
meeting of Carolina Financial’s stockholders to be held on October 24, 2017, at 4:00 p.m., local time, at the Charleston Country Club,
1 Country Club Drive, Charleston, SC 29412, and at any adjournments of the special meeting. The board of directors of First South
Bancorp, Inc. (“First South”) is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the accompanying form of proxy to First South
stockholders to vote at a special meeting of First South’s stockholders to be held on October 26, 2017, at 11:00 a.m., local time, at the
First South Bank Operations Center, 220 Creekside Drive, Washington, NC 27889, and at any adjournments of the special meeting.

 
Carolina Financial and First South entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of June 9,

2017. Under the terms of the merger agreement, First South will be merged with and into Carolina Financial, with Carolina Financial
as the surviving corporation. The boards of directors of each of Carolina Financial and First South have unanimously adopted the
merger agreement and authorized and approved the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. At the special meetings,
the stockholders of each party to the merger agreement will be asked to approve, among other things, a proposal to approve the merger
agreement. Each of the boards of directors of Carolina Financial and First South unanimously recommend that their respective
stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement and “FOR” all of the remaining proposals to be voted
on at their respective special meetings as set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Completion of the merger is subject to regulatory approval, approval of the merger agreement by Carolina Financial and First

South stockholders, and other customary closing conditions. If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of First South common
stock will be exchanged for 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial common stock; provided, however, that if the closing price of Carolina
Financial common stock is greater than $35.14 just prior to closing of the merger and it has outperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by
15%, the exchange ratio will be decreased based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. If the closing price of Carolina
Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to closing and it has underperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more,
First South can terminate the merger agreement unless Carolina Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash
consideration, based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. Cash will also be paid in lieu of fractional shares.

 
The value of the Carolina Financial shares to be issued in the merger will fluctuate between now and the closing date of the

merger. Carolina Financial common stock and First South common stock are listed on NASDAQ under the symbols “CARO” and
“FSBK,” respectively. On June 9, 2017, the date of the merger agreement, the closing price per share of Carolina Financial common
stock was $32.49 and the closing price per share of First South common stock was $14.60. On August 28, 2017, the latest practicable
trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price per share of Carolina Financial common stock
was $34.15 and the closing price per share of First South common stock was $17.47. Thus, the equivalent value of the merger
consideration per share of First South common stock was approximately $17.76, and the aggregate merger consideration was
approximately $168.8 million on August 28, 2017. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for the shares of Carolina
Financial common stock and First South common stock.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER
 

The following are some questions that you may have regarding the merger and the special stockholders’ meetings and brief
answers to those questions. We urge you to carefully read the remainder of joint proxy statement/prospectus because the information in
this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger and the special stockholders’
meetings. 

 
Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus and what will I be asked to vote on?
 
A: Carolina Financial and First South have agreed to a merger pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, a copy of which is

included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. In order to complete the merger, among other things, Carolina
Financial stockholders must approve the merger agreement and the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial common stock to
First South stockholders in connection with the merger, and First South stockholders must approve the merger agreement. In
addition, while not a condition to the closing of the merger, Carolina Financial stockholders will vote on proposal to adjourn
the meeting under specified circumstances and First South stockholders will be asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on
merger-related compensation that will be received by certain First South executives and will vote on a proposal to adjourn the
meeting under specified circumstances.

 
Carolina Financial and First South will hold separate special meetings of their respective stockholders to vote on these
proposals.

 
Q: Why is my vote important?
 
A: The merger agreement must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of

Carolina Financial common stock and the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of First South
common stock. Accordingly, if a Carolina Financial or First South stockholder fails to vote on the merger agreement, or does
not instruct his or her broker how to vote any shares held for him or her in “street name,” it will have the same effect as a vote
against the merger agreement.

 
Q: Why is First South merging with Carolina Financial?
 
A: First South is merging with Carolina Financial because the boards of directors of both companies believe that the merger will

provide stockholders of both companies with substantial benefits and will enable the combined company to better serve its
customers. The combined company would have an increased presence in North Carolina. A detailed discussion of the
background of and reasons for the proposed merger is contained under the headings “Background of the Merger,” “First
South’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the First South Board of Directors,” and “Carolina Financial’s Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of the Carolina Financial Board of Director,” under “The Merger.”

 
Q: What will I receive in the merger?
 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: Whether or not the merger is completed, Carolina Financial stockholders will retain the

Carolina Financial common stock that they currently own. They will not receive any merger consideration, and they will not
receive any cash or any additional shares of Carolina Financial common stock in the merger.

 
First South stockholders: If the merger is completed, First South stockholders will receive 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial
common stock for each share of First South common stock that they hold at the effective time of the merger, plus cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Carolina Financial common stock; provided however, that if the closing price of Carolina Financial
common stock is greater than $35.14 just prior to closing of the merger and it has outperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by
15% or more between signing and closing, the exchange ratio will be decreased automatically based upon the change in the
NASDAQ Bank Index. If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to closing and it
has underperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, First South can terminate the
merger agreement unless Carolina Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash consideration to make up the
difference, based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index.

We urge you to obtain current market quotations for the shares of Carolina Financial common stock and First South common
stock.

 
Q: Will First South stockholders be taxed on the cash and Carolina Financial common stock that they receive in exchange

for their First South shares?
 
A: The merger is expected to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended

(the “Code”). Accordingly, we expect that First South stockholders will generally not recognize any gain or loss on the
conversion of shares of First South common stock into shares of Carolina Financial common stock but will recognize gain on
any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Carolina Financial common stock or in the event a price increase is triggered,
and Carolina Financial elects to pay the adjustment in cash. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences and
Opinion of Tax Counsel” beginning on page 94.

 
Q: When and where will the special meetings be held?
 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: The special meeting of Carolina Financial stockholders will be held at the Charleston

Country Club, 1 Country Club Drive, Charleston, SC 29412, on October 24, 2017, at 4:00 p.m., local time.
 

First South stockholders: The special meeting of First South stockholders will be held at the First South Bank Operations
Center, 220 Creekside Drive, Washington, NC 27889, on October 26, 2017, at 11:00 a.m., local time.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meetings?
 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: The record date for the Carolina Financial special meeting is August 28, 2017. Only record

holders of shares of Carolina Financial common stock at the close of business on such date are entitled to notice of, and to
vote at, the Carolina Financial special meeting.

 
First South stockholders: The record date for the First South special meeting is August 25, 2017. Only record holders of
shares of First South common stock at the close of business on such date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the First
South special meeting.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum at the special meetings?
 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: Stockholders who hold shares representing at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at

the Carolina Financial special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum. All shares of
Carolina Financial common stock represented at the Carolina Financial special meeting, either in person or by proxy,
including failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the
presence or absence of a quorum.

 
First South stockholders: Stockholders who hold shares representing at least one-third of the shares entitled to vote at the First
South special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum. All shares of First South
common stock represented at the First South special meeting, either in person or by proxy, including failures to vote, broker
non-votes and abstentions, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum.

 
Q: How many votes do I have?
 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: With respect to each proposal to be presented at the Carolina Financial special meeting,

holders of Carolina Financial common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Carolina Financial common stock
owned at the close of business on the Carolina Financial record date.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 17/222

 

First South stockholders: With respect to each proposal to be presented at the First South special meeting, holders of First
South common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of First South common stock owned at the close of business on the
First South record date.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal?
 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: The proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of

the issued and outstanding shares of Carolina Financial common stock entitled to vote at the Carolina Financial special
meeting. Failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. The
remaining proposals each require the approval of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Carolina Financial special
meeting. Failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the vote for three proposals.

 
First South stockholders: The proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
issued and outstanding shares of First South common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Failures to vote, broker
non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. The remaining proposals each require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the First South special meeting. Failures to vote, broker non-
votes and abstentions will have no effect on the vote for three proposals.

 
Q: How does the Carolina Financial board of directors recommend that Carolina Financial stockholders vote?
 
A: The Carolina Financial board of directors unanimously recommends that Carolina Financial stockholders vote “FOR” the

proposal to approve the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial
common stock to First South stockholders in connection with the merger, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: How does the First South board of directors recommend that First South stockholders vote?
 
A: The First South board of directors unanimously recommends that First South stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to

approve the merger agreement, “FOR” the First South merger-related compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal.

 
Q: How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?

 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: If you were a record holder of Carolina Financial common stock at the close of business on

the record date for the Carolina Financial special meeting, you may vote in person by attending the Carolina Financial special
meeting, or you may authorize a proxy to vote by:

 
· submitting your Carolina Financial proxy by mail by using the provided self-addressed, stamped envelope;

· visiting the internet site listed on the Carolina Financial proxy and following the instructions provided on that site
anytime until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 23, 2017; or

· calling the toll-free number listed on the Carolina Financial proxy and following the instructions provided in the
recorded message anytime until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 23, 2017.

First South stockholders: If you were a record holder of First South Class common stock at the close of business on the record
date for the First South special meeting, you may vote in person by attending the First South special meeting, or you may
authorize a proxy to vote by:
 

· submitting your First South proxy by mail by using the provided self-addressed, stamped envelope;

· visiting the internet site listed on the First South proxy and following the instructions provided on that site anytime
until 1:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on October 26, 2017; or

· calling the toll-free number listed on the First South proxy and following the instructions provided in the recorded
message anytime until 1:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on October 26, 2017.

Q: My shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee. Will my broker, bank or other nominee
automatically vote my shares for me?

 
A: No. If your shares are held through a stock brokerage account, bank or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial

holder” of the shares held for you in what is known as “street name.” The “record holder” of such shares is your broker, bank
or other nominee, and not you. If this is the case, this joint proxy statement/prospectus has been forwarded to you by your
broker, bank or other nominee. You must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your
shares. Otherwise, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of the proposals to be considered at
the Carolina Financial special meeting or the First South special meeting, as applicable, and a broker non-vote will result.

 
Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee so that it may vote your shares on your
behalf. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Carolina Financial or
First South or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you first obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or
other nominee.

 
Q: What will happen if I return my proxy without indicating how to vote?

 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: If you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of

Carolina Financial common stock should be voted on a proposal, the shares of Carolina Financial common stock represented
by your proxy will be voted as the Carolina Financial board of directors recommends and, therefore, “FOR” the proposal to
approve the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial common stock to
First South stockholders in connection with the merger, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

 
First South stockholders: If you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of First
South common stock should be voted on a proposal, the shares of First South common stock represented by your proxy will
be voted as the First South board of directors recommends and, therefore, “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, “FOR” the First South merger-related compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?

 
A: Yes. If you are the record holder of either Carolina Financial or First South stock, you can change your vote or revoke your

proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the applicable special meeting. You can do this by:
 

· timely delivering a signed written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Carolina Financial or First South, as
applicable;
 

· timely delivering a new, valid proxy bearing a later date;
 

· casting a subsequent vote via telephone or internet; or
 

· attending the special meeting and voting in person. Simply attending the Carolina Financial special meeting or the First
South special meeting without voting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or change your vote.

If you hold shares of either Carolina Financial or First South in “street name,” you must contact your broker, bank or other
nominee to change your vote.

 
Q: Do I need to do anything with my shares of common stock other than vote for the proposals at the special meeting?

 
A: Carolina Financial stockholders: If you are a Carolina Financial stockholder, after the merger is completed, you are not

required to take any action with respect to your shares of Carolina Financial common stock.
 

First South stockholders: If you are a First South stockholder, after the merger is completed, each share of First South
common stock that you hold will be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial
common stock, assuming that the exchange ratio is not adjusted under certain circumstances as provided by the merger
agreement and described herein, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share. You will receive instructions at that time
regarding exchanging your First South shares for shares of Carolina Financial common stock. You do not need to take any
action at this time. Please do not send your First South stock certificates with your proxy.

 
Q: Do I have the right to dissent and obtain the “fair value” for my shares?

 
A: No. Under Delaware law and Virginia law, as well as the governing instruments of each company, neither the holders of

Carolina Financial common stock nor the holders of First South common stock are entitled to appraisal rights or dissenters’
rights in connection with the merger.

 
Q: What if I hold shares in both Carolina Financial and First South?

 
A: If you are both a Carolina Financial stockholder and a First South stockholder, you will receive two separate packages of

proxy materials. A vote cast as a Carolina Financial stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a First South stockholder, and
a vote cast as a First South stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a Carolina Financial stockholder. Therefore, please
separately submit a proxy for each of your Carolina Financial and First South shares.

 
Q: When do you expect to complete the merger?

 
A: We presently expect to complete the merger by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. However, we cannot assure you when or

if the merger will occur. We must first obtain the approval of the Carolina Financial stockholders and the First South
stockholders at their respective special meetings as well as the necessary regulatory approvals.

 
Q: Who can help answer my questions?

meetings, or how to submit a proxy or who desire additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or additional

SUMMARY
 

This summary highlights material information regarding the merger and the special meetings contained later in joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and we urge you to carefully
read this entire document carefully, including the Annexes, exhibits and enclosures, to better understand the merger and its potential
impact on you before deciding how to vote. Each item in this summary includes a page reference directing you to a more complete

The Companies (page 105 for Carolina Financial and page 105 for First South)

 
Carolina Financial Corporation

288 Meeting Street
Charleston, South Carolina 29401

(843) 723-7700
Jerold L. Rexroad, President and Chief Executive Officer

 
Carolina Financial Corporation is a Delaware corporation and a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding

Company Act of 1956. Its primary business is to serve as the holding company for CresCom Bank, a South Carolina state-chartered
commercial bank with 34 branches located throughout the Carolinas, in addition to a loan production office in Greenville, South
Carolina. CresCom Bank is primarily engaged in the business of accepting demand deposits and savings deposits insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), and providing commercial, consumer and mortgage loans to the general public.
CresCom Bank operates Crescent Mortgage Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CresCom Bank based in Atlanta, Georgia, as a
wholesale and correspondent mortgage lender for community banks. Crescent Mortgage Company is licensed to originate loans in 48
states, partnering with community banks, credit unions and mortgage brokers. CresCom Bank also operates Carolina Services
Corporation of Charleston, a Delaware financial services company that provides financial processing services to, and otherwise
supports the operations of, CresCom Bank and Crescent Mortgage Company.

 
First South Bancorp, Inc.

1311 Carolina Avenue
Washington, North Carolina 27889

(888) 993-7664
Bruce W. Elder, President and Chief Executive Officer

 
First South Bancorp, Inc. is a Virginia corporation and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of

1956. Its primary business is to own and control all of the capital stock of First South Bank. First South Bank opened for business in
1902. First South Bank currently maintains a main office located at 1311 Carolina Avenue, Washington, North Carolina and 28 full-
service branch offices throughout eastern and central North Carolina.

 
The Merger (page 40)

 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, First South will merge with and into Carolina Financial, with Carolina Financial

being the surviving corporation (we refer to this as the “merger”). Simultaneously with the merger or immediately thereafter, First
South Bank will merge with and into CresCom Bank, and CresCom Bank will be the surviving bank (we refer to this as the “bank
merger”). Both Carolina Financial and CresCom Bank will continue their existence under Delaware and South Carolina law,
respectively, while First South and First South Bank will cease to exist. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A and is
incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully as it is
the legal document that governs the merger.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 22/222

 

What First South Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger (page 81)
 
If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of First South common stock will be exchanged for 0.5200 shares of

Carolina Financial common stock. If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is greater than $35.14 just prior to the
scheduled closing of the merger and it has outperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, the
exchange ratio will be decreased automatically based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. If the closing price of Carolina
Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to the scheduled closing of the merger and it has underperformed the NASDAQ
Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, First South can terminate the merger agreement unless Carolina Financial
elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash consideration to make up the difference, based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank
Index. First South stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Carolina Financial common stock. Instead, they will be paid
cash in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of Carolina Financial common stock otherwise issuable upon conversion multiplied
by the Carolina Financial Average Closing Price, as defined in the merger agreement.

 
Based on the number of shares of Carolina Financial common stock and First South common stock outstanding at the close of

business on August 28, 2017, and based on the number of shares of Carolina Financial common stock expected to be issued in the
merger, the former First South stockholders as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 23.4% of the
outstanding shares of Carolina Financial common stock immediately after the merger. As a result, the current Carolina Financial
stockholders as a group will own approximately 76.6% of the outstanding shares of Carolina Financial common stock immediately
after the merger.

 
Effect of the Merger on First South Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards (page 82)

 
As of the date of the merger agreement, there were outstanding options to purchase 144,350 shares of First South common

stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $9.96 per share. All unvested stock options outstanding at the time of the merger will
vest upon the effective date of the merger. In connection with entering into the merger agreement, First South has agreed to offer each
of the current holders of its stock options the opportunity to cancel, effective upon and subject to the merger, all of their respective
stock options covering shares of First South’s common stock having an exercise price per share less than the per share value of the
merger consideration in exchange for a cash payment equal to the per share value of the merger consideration minus the exercise price
for each share of First South’s common stock subject to such stock option. Any stock option not cashed out will convert into an option
to acquire shares of Carolina Financial common stock, as adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.

 
All unvested restricted stock awards outstanding at the time of the merger will vest upon the effective date of the merger. 
 

Regulatory Approvals (page 78)
 

Because the merger qualifies as a “waiver transaction” under the applicable rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), we are not required to file a formal merger application with the Federal Reserve
and must only make a notice filing with the Federal Reserve with respect to the merger. However, for the merger of First South Bank
with and into CresCom Bank, we must obtain approval from the FDIC, the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions (the
“SCBFI”), and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the “NCCOB”). As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we
have not received any of the required regulatory approvals for the bank merger, but the Federal Reserve has advised us of its non-
objection to characterization of the merger as a “waiver transaction.”

 
Carolina Financial’s Special Stockholders’ Meeting (page 32)

 
Carolina Financial will hold its special stockholders’ meeting on October 24, 2017, at 4:00 p.m., local time, at the Charleston

Country Club, 1 Country Club Drive, Charleston, SC 29412.
 

Carolina Financial’s Record Date and Voting (page 32-35)
 
If you owned shares of Carolina Financial common stock at the close of business on August 28, 2017, the record date for the

Carolina Financial special stockholders’ meeting, you are entitled to vote on the merger agreement as well as any other matters
considered at the special stockholders’ meeting. On the record date, there were 16,197,152 shares of Carolina Financial common stock
outstanding. You will have one vote at the meeting for each share of common stock you owned on the record date. The affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of Carolina Financial’s outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve the merger agreement.
As of August 28, 2017, Carolina Financial’s directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately
9.59% of the outstanding shares of Carolina Financial common stock.

Carolina Financial’s Board of Directors Recommends that Carolina Financial Stockholders Vote “FOR” the Approval of the
Merger Agreement (page 32)

 
Carolina Financial’s board of directors has determined that the merger, the merger agreement, and the transactions

contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Carolina Financial and its stockholders and has
adopted the merger agreement. Carolina Financial’s board of directors recommends that Carolina Financial stockholders vote “FOR”
the approval of the merger agreement. For the factors considered by Carolina Financial’s board of directors in reaching its decision to
adopt the merger agreement, see “The Merger—Carolina Financial’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Carolina
Financial Board of Directors.”

 
Opinion of Carolina Financial’s Financial Advisor (page 60 and Appendix B)
 

In connection with the merger, Carolina Financial’s financial advisor, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW”), delivered a
written opinion, dated June 9, 2017, to the Carolina Financial board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as
of the date of the opinion, to Carolina Financial of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger. The full text of KBW’s opinion, which
describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken
by KBW in preparing the opinion, is attached as Appendix B to this document. The opinion was for the information of, and was
directed to, the Carolina Financial board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the
financial terms of the merger. The opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Carolina Financial to engage in
the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Carolina Financial board of directors in
connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Carolina Financial common stock or
any stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter.

First South’s Special Stockholders’ Meeting (page 36)
 
First South will hold its special stockholders’ meeting on October 26, 2017, at 11:00 a.m., local time, at the First South Bank

Operations Center, 220 Creekside Drive, Washington, NC 27889.
 

First South’s Record Date and Voting (page 36-39)
 
If you owned shares of First South common stock at the close of business on August 25, 2017, the record date for the First

South special stockholders’ meeting, you are entitled to vote on the merger agreement as well as any other matters considered at the
special stockholders’ meeting. On the record date, there were 9,503,691 shares of First South common stock outstanding. You will
have one vote at the meeting for each share of common stock you owned on the record date. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-
thirds of First South’s outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve the merger agreement. As of August 25, 2017, First
South’s directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 6.68% of the outstanding shares of First
South common stock. Each of First South’s directors and named executive officers has agreed, subject to several conditions, to vote his
or her shares of First South common stock in favor of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

Opinion of First South’s Financial Advisor (page 52 and Appendix C)

At the June 9, 2017 meeting of the First South board of directors, representatives of Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
(“Raymond James”) delivered Raymond James’ written opinion, dated and as of June 9, 2017, to the First South board of directors as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of First South’s outstanding common stock of the exchange ratio to be
received by such holders in the merger, based upon and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and other matters considered in
connection with the preparation of its opinion.
 

The full text of the written opinion of Raymond James, dated June 9, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the various
qualifications, assumptions and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this document. Raymond
James provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the First South board (solely in each director’s capacity as such) in
connection with, and for purposes of, its consideration of the merger and its opinion only addresses whether the exchange ratio to be
received by the holders of First South common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders. The opinion of Raymond James did not address any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger
contemplated thereby. The Raymond James opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the First South board or any holder of
First South common stock as to how the First South board, such stockholder or any other person should vote or otherwise act with
respect to the merger or any other matter.

 
Interests of Executive Officers, Employees and Directors of First South that Differ from Your Interests (page 73)

When considering whether to approve the merger agreement, you should be aware that some officers and directors of First
South have interests in the merger that differ from the interests of other First South stockholders, including, among other things, the
following:

· two incumbent directors of First South will be invited to join the board of directors of Carolina Financial and the
remaining incumbent directors of First South will be invited to join a regional advisory board of CresCom Bank and will
receive certain advisory fees for their service;

· Bruce W. Elder, President and Chief Executive Officer of First South, will be invited to join the board of directors of
CresCom Bank, and will serve as CresCom Bank’s President of North Carolina Banking following the merger, pursuant
to an employment agreement entered into with CresCom Bank;

· Cornelius F. Sullivan, Senior Vice President and Area Executive of First South, will become CresCom Bank’s Senior Vice
President and Raleigh Area Executive, pursuant to an employment agreement entered into with CresCom Bank;



9/17/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm

· in connection with the closing of the merger, certain officers of First South will receive change in control payments under
their respective employment, change in control or other agreements with First South;

· certain officers and directors of First South may receive lump sum cash payments in exchange for the cancellation of their
outstanding stock options, and any stock options not cashed out will be converted into options to acquire shares of
Carolina Financial common stock, as adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio; and

· following the merger, Carolina Financial will generally indemnify and provide liability insurance to the present directors
and officers of First South, subject to certain exceptions.

Each First South board member was aware of these and other interests and considered them before approving and adopting the
merger agreement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences and Opinion of Tax Counsel (page 94)

The merger is expected to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Accordingly, we expect that First
South stockholders will generally not recognize any gain or loss on the conversion of shares of First South common stock into shares
of Carolina Financial common stock but will recognize gain (but not any loss) on any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of
Carolina Financial common stock, or in the event a price increase is triggered and Carolina Financial elects to pay the adjustment in
cash. Carolina Financial stockholders generally will have no direct tax consequences as a result of the merger. If the merger does not
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, First South’s stockholders generally will recognize gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the fair market value of the Carolina Financial common stock and
cash received in the merger and (2) the basis in their First South common stock. Tax matters are complicated, and the tax consequences
of the merger may vary among First South stockholders. We urge each First South stockholder to contact his or her own tax advisor to
fully understand the tax implications of the merger.

Comparative Rights of Stockholders (page 97)
 
The rights of First South’s stockholders are currently governed by Virginia corporate law and First South’s articles of

incorporation and bylaws. The rights of Carolina Financial’s stockholders are currently governed by Delaware corporate law and
Carolina Financial’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Upon consummation of the merger, the stockholders of First South will
become stockholders of Carolina Financial, and Delaware corporate law, as well as the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Carolina Financial, will govern their rights. Carolina Financial’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws differ somewhat from those of
First South.

 
Termination of the Merger Agreement and Termination Fee (page 91)

Notwithstanding the approval of the merger agreement by the Carolina Financial stockholders or the First South stockholders,
the parties can mutually agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement before completing the merger.

Either Carolina Financial or First South can also terminate the merger agreement:

· If the other party breaches any representation or warranty in the merger agreement which cannot be or is not cured within
30 days of notice of such breach; provided, that such breach is reasonably likely, in the opinion of the non-breaching
party, to permit such party to refuse to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

 
· If any regulatory authority whose approval is required for consummation of the merger makes a final non-appealable

decision not to approve the merger, if any final law or order permanently restrains, enjoins, or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the merger, if the requisite First South stockholder vote is not obtained at the First South special
meeting, or if the requisite Carolina Financial stockholder vote is not obtained at the Carolina Financial special meeting;
or

 
· If the merger is not completed by March 31, 2018.

Carolina Financial can also terminate the merger agreement if First South’s board of directors (i) withdraws or modifies its
recommendation that the First South stockholders approve the merger agreement or approves or recommends an acquisition proposal
by a third party, (ii) fails to reaffirm the merger agreement after being requested to do so following the announcement of an acquisition
proposal by a third party, or (iii) otherwise fails to comply with the terms of the merger agreement regarding obtaining stockholder
approval of the merger agreement and soliciting other offers for an acquisition of First South. In this event, First South must pay a
$5,750,000 termination fee to Carolina Financial.

If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to closing and it has underperformed the
NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, First South can terminate the merger agreement unless Carolina
Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash consideration to make up the difference, based upon the change in the
NASDAQ Bank Index.

 
First South can also terminate the merger agreement if First South’s stockholders do not approve the merger agreement at the

First South special meeting, and prior to the First South special meeting, First South received a superior proposal which did not result
from a breach of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, and First South’s board of directors determines to enter
into a definitive agreement for such proposal upon termination of the merger agreement and enters into such agreement concurrently
with its termination of the merger agreement. In this event, First South must pay a $5,750,000 termination fee to Carolina Financial.
 

In addition, if (i) an acquisition proposal with respect to First South is communicated to the stockholders, senior management,
or board of directors of First South or any person publicly announces an intention to make an acquisition proposal with respect to First
South after the date of the merger agreement, (ii) the merger agreement is then terminated due to a failure to obtain the First South
stockholder vote, a material breach of the merger agreement by First South, or failure to close the merger by March 31, 2018, and (iii)
within one year after the termination of the merger agreement, First South consummates an acquisition transaction or enters into an
acquisition agreement, then it must pay the $5,750,000 termination fee to Carolina Financial.

Accounting Treatment (page 96)
 
Carolina Financial will account for the merger using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this accounting method,

Carolina Financial will record the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair market value at the time the merger is
complete. Any excess of the cost of First South over the sum of the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets less
liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Based on an assumed purchase price of $169.9 million and utilizing information as of
August 28, 2017 estimated goodwill and other intangibles would total approximately $102.1 million. Carolina Financial’s reported
income would include the operations of First South after the merger. Financial statements of Carolina Financial after completion of the
merger will reflect the impact of the acquisition of First South. Financial statements of Carolina Financial issued before completion of
the merger will not be restated retroactively to reflect First South’s historical financial position or results of operations.

 
Market Price and Dividend Information

 
Carolina Financial’s common stock and First South’s common stock are currently listed on NASDAQ under the symbols

“CARO” and “FSBK,” respectively.
 
As of August 28, 2017, there were approximately 1,486 holders of record of common stock of Carolina Financial. The following

table presents the closing sale price per share of Carolina Financial common stock on June 9, 2017, the last trading day before we
publicly announced the merger agreement, and August 28, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to mailing joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The table also presents the equivalent value of the merger consideration per share of First South common stock
on those dates, calculated by multiplying the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock on those dates by the exchange ratio.  

 

Date

Closing Price 
Equivalent First South

Per Share Value
June 9, 2017  $32.49 $16.89

August 28, 2017  $34.15 $17.76

Because the exchange ratio is fixed unless the market price of Carolina Financial increases or decreases beyond a
specified range, and because the market price of Carolina Financial common stock is subject to fluctuation, the market value of
the shares of Carolina Financial common stock that First South stockholders may receive in the merger may increase or
decrease prior to and following the merger. First South stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for
Carolina Financial common stock, which are available at www.nasdaq.com.

The following table shows the high and low sales prices of Carolina Financial common stock published by NASDAQ since
2015. Carolina Financial paid quarterly dividends as shown below.

 Carolina Financial is authorized to pay dividends as declared by the board of directors, provided that no such distribution

results in insolvency on a going concern or balance sheet basis. On July 26, 2013, Carolina Financial’s board of directors approved the
initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to the common stockholders. However, future dividends will be subject to board approval. As
Carolina Financial is a legal entity separate and distinct from CresCom Bank, its principal source of funds with which it can pay
dividends to its stockholders is dividends it receives from CresCom Bank. For that reason, its ability to pay dividends is subject to the
limitations that apply to CresCom Bank. A South Carolina state bank may not pay dividends from capital. All dividends must be paid
out of undivided profits then on hand, after deducting expenses, including reserves for losses and bad debts. Unless otherwise
instructed by the SCBFI, CresCom Bank is generally permitted under South Carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends
of up to 100% of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the SCBFI. In addition, under the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, CresCom Bank may not pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, CresCom Bank
would be undercapitalized. The Federal Reserve may also prevent the payment of a dividend by CresCom Bank if it determines that the
payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

 
NASDAQ Listing

 
Carolina Financial will list the shares of Carolina Financial common stock to be issued to the stockholders of First South in

connection with the merger on NASDAQ under the symbol “CARO”.
 

Resale of Carolina Financial Common Stock (page 83)
 
The shares of Carolina Financial common stock to be issued to the stockholders of First South in connection with the merger

will be freely tradable by such stockholders, except that if any First South stockholders are deemed to be affiliates of Carolina
Financial, they must abide by certain transfer restrictions under the Securities Act.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and explanatory notes show the impact on the
historical financial positions and results of operations of Carolina Financial and First South and have been prepared to illustrate the
effects of the merger involving Carolina Financial and First South under the acquisition method of accounting with Carolina Financial
treated as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of First South, as of the effective date of
the merger, will be recorded by Carolina Financial at their respective fair values and the excess of the merger consideration over the
fair value of First South’s net assets will be allocated to goodwill. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives
effect to the merger as if the merger had been consummated on June 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and six months ended June 30, 2017 are presented as if the merger had
occurred on January 1, 2016. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually supportable items
that are directly attributable to the merger and, with respect to the income statements only, expected to have a continuing impact on
consolidated results of operations.

 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not

necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of the
periods presented. The adjustments included in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are preliminary
and may be revised. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not consider any potential impacts
of potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and expense efficiencies, or asset dispositions, among other factors.

 
As explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information,

the pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on
preliminary estimations and subject to adjustment and may vary from actual recorded purchase price allocation.

 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only. The

unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not necessarily, and should not be assumed to be, an indication of
the results that would have been achieved had the transaction been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the
future. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and related adjustments required
management to make certain assumptions and estimates.

information. All adjustments are based on current assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change.

J. Estimated fair market value adjustments associated with First South’s long-term debt based on the interest rate paid on similar

market products.

value of $32.32 per share (closing price on June 30, 2017), resulting in stock merger consideration of approximately $161.2
million and the elimination of the First South common stock and additional paid-in-capital as part of the accounting entries to
reflect the transaction.

L. Elimination of First South retained earnings as part of the accounting entries to reflect the transaction.
M. Elimination of accumulated other comprehensive income of First South as part of the accounting entries to reflect the

Note II – Merger Related Charges
 

The estimated transaction costs related to the merger are approximately $23.7 million or approximately $15.7 million net of
tax. This cost is included in the Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet and is assumed to be paid 50% by the buyer and
50% by the seller. These estimated transaction costs are still being developed and will continue to be refined over the next several
months, and will include assessing personnel, benefit plans, premises, equipment, and service contracts to determine where they may
take advantage of redundancies. These costs will be recorded as non-interest expense as incurred.
 
Note III – Preliminary Purchase Accounting Allocation
 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, First South shareholders have the right to receive 0.52 shares of Carolina Financial
common stock for each share of First South common stock they owned immediately prior to the merger, subject to the adjustment of
the exchange ratio under certain circumstances as provided by the merger agreement. In addition, in-the-money stock options may be
cashed out, net of exercise price. The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial information reflects the issuance of
approximately 4,942,000 shares of Carolina Financial common stock with an aggregate value of $160.8 million based on the closing
stock price of $32.32 per share at June 30, 2017. The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting;
accordingly, Carolina Financial’s cost to acquire First South will be allocated to the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and
liabilities of First South at their respective estimated fair values as of the merger date. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price was
preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of June 30, 2017 based on their estimated fair values, as
summarized in the following table.

RISK FACTORS
 
If the merger is consummated and you are a First South stockholder, you will receive shares of Carolina Financial common

stock in exchange for your shares of First South common stock. An investment in Carolina Financial common stock is subject to a
number of risks and uncertainties, many of which also apply to your existing investment in First South common stock. Risks and
uncertainties relating to general economic conditions are not summarized below. Those risks, among others, are highlighted on page
28 under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” In addition to the other information contained
in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the risk factors included in Carolina Financial’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, in First South’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended March 31, 2017 and the matters addressed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the heading “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding how to vote
on the merger agreement.

 
Carolina Financial and First South stockholders will experience a reduction in percentage ownership and voting power of their
shares as a result of the merger.

 
Carolina Financial stockholders and First South stockholders will experience a substantial reduction in their respective

percentage ownership interests and effective voting power relative to their respective percentage ownership interests in Carolina
Financial and First South compared to their ownership interests and voting power prior to the merger. Based on the number of shares of
Carolina Financial common stock and First South common stock outstanding at the close of business on August 28, 2017, and based on
the number of shares of Carolina Financial common stock expected to be issued in the merger, the former First South stockholders as a
group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 23.4% of the outstanding shares of Carolina Financial common
stock immediately after the merger. As a result, the current Carolina Financial stockholders as a group will own approximately 76.6%
of the outstanding shares of Carolina Financial common stock immediately after the merger. Accordingly, former First South
stockholders will own less than a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the combined company and could, as a result, be outvoted
by current Carolina Financial stockholders if such current Carolina Financial stockholders voted together as a group. Stockholders of
both companies will experience a reduction in percentage ownership and voting power of their shares as a result of the merger.

 
Because the market price of Carolina Financial common stock will fluctuate, First South stockholders cannot be sure of the exact
value of shares of Carolina Financial common stock they will receive.

 
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of First South common stock will be converted into the merger

consideration consisting of shares of Carolina Financial common stock, as provided in the merger agreement. The closing price of
Carolina Financial common stock on the date that the stockholder actually receives the shares of such stock after the merger is
completed and the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock the date on which the effective time of the merger is to occur may
vary from each other, as well as from the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock on the date that the Carolina Financial and
First South announced the merger, on the date that this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed to Carolina Financial and First
South stockholders, and on the date of the special stockholders’ meetings. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors,
including general market and economic conditions, changes in Carolina Financial’s business, operations and prospects, and regulatory
considerations, among other things. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Carolina Financial. Accordingly, at the time of the
First South special stockholders’ meeting, because of the above timing differences, First South stockholders will not be able to
calculate the exact value of Carolina Financial common stock they may receive upon completion of the merger.

 
Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than Carolina Financial or First South expects.

 
The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Carolina Financial’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost

savings from combining the businesses of Carolina Financial and First South. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost
savings, we must successfully combine the businesses of Carolina Financial and First South. If we are not able to achieve these
objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than
expected.

Carolina Financial and First South have operated, and, until completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently.
It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of each company’s ongoing business or
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that would adversely affect Carolina Financial’s ability to maintain
relationships with clients, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between
the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each
of Carolina Financial and First South during that transition period.

 
Carolina Financial and First South will incur significant transaction and merger-related integration costs in connection with the
merger.

 
Carolina Financial and First South expect to incur significant costs associated with completing the merger and integrating the

operations of the two companies. Carolina Financial and First South are continuing to assess the impact of these costs. Although
Carolina Financial and First South believe that the elimination of duplicate costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related
to the integration of the businesses, will offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be
achieved in the near term, or at all.

 
Carolina Financial has not previously operated in First South’s markets in eastern and central North Carolina.

 
First South’s service areas are eastern and central North Carolina. The banking business in these areas is extremely

competitive, and the level of competition may increase further. Carolina Financial has not previously participated in these markets, and
there may be unexpected challenges and difficulties that could adversely affect Carolina Financial following the merger.

 
The fairness opinion received by the Carolina Financial board of directors from KBW, and the fairness opinion received by the
First South board of directors from Raymond James, in each case prior to execution of the merger agreement, do not reflect any
changes in circumstances that may have occurred since the date of such opinions.

 
The fairness opinions of KBW and Raymond James were rendered to the parties’ respective board of directors on June 9,

2017. Changes in the operations and prospects of Carolina Financial or First South, general market and economic conditions and other
factors which may be beyond the control of Carolina Financial and First South may have altered the value of Carolina Financial or
First South or the sale prices of shares of Carolina Financial common stock and First South common stock as of the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, or may alter such values and sale prices by the time the merger is completed. The opinions from KBW and
Raymond James, each dated June 9, 2017, do not speak as of any date other than the dates of such opinions.

 
Carolina Financial and First South may not receive regulatory approvals or such approvals may take longer than expected or
impose conditions Carolina Financial and First South do not presently anticipate.

 
The merger of the two banks must be approved by the FDIC, the SCBFI, and the NCCOB. These regulatory agencies will

consider, among other things, the competitive impact of the bank merger, each of Carolina Financial and First South’s financial and
managerial resources, and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. As part of that consideration, Carolina Financial
and First South expect that the FDIC will review the capital position, safety and soundness, and legal and regulatory compliance
matters and Community Reinvestment Act matters. There can be no assurance as to whether the necessary regulatory approvals will be
received, the timing of such approvals, or whether any conditions will be imposed that might limit the combined company’s ability to
do business after the bank merger as presently anticipated.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 44/222

 

The merger agreement limits First South’s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.
 
The merger agreement contains provisions that limit First South’s ability to discuss competing third-party proposals to acquire

all or a significant part of First South. In addition, First South has agreed to pay Carolina Financial a termination fee of $5,750,000 if
the transaction is terminated because First South decides to pursue another acquisition transaction, among other things. These
provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of First
South from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price than
that proposed in the merger with Carolina Financial, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per
share price to acquire First South than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.

First South directors and officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
First South stockholders.

Officers of First South negotiated certain terms of the merger agreement with their counterparts at Carolina Financial, and
First South’s board of directors adopted the merger agreement by a unanimous vote and recommended that First South stockholders
vote to approve the merger agreement and the merger on the terms set forth in the merger agreement. In considering these facts and the
other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, First South stockholders should be aware that First South’s
directors and officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of First South
stockholders. For example, two of First South’s directors will be invited to join the Carolina Financial board of directors, and the
remaining First South directors will be entitled to participate on an advisory board of CresCom Bank following the merger and will
receive certain fees for their service, and Bruce W. Elder, President and Chief Executive Officer of First South, will be invited to join
the Board of Directors of CresCom Bank. In addition, certain officers of First South have entered into agreements with First South and
Carolina Financial that provide, among other things, retention, employment, consulting, severance and/or other benefits following the
merger. These and some other additional interests of First South directors and officers may create potential conflicts of interest and
cause some of these persons to view the proposed transaction differently than First South stockholders may view it. See “The Merger—
Interests of Executive Officers, Employees and Directors of First South in the Merger” for information about these financial interests.

If the merger is not completed, Carolina Financial common stock and First South common stock could be materially adversely
affected.

The merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the approval of the First South stockholders and the
Carolina Financial stockholders. In addition, Carolina Financial and First South may terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances. If Carolina Financial and First South do not complete the merger, the market price of Carolina Financial common stock
or First South common stock may fluctuate to the extent that the current market prices of those shares reflect a market assumption that
the merger will be completed. Further, whether or not the merger is completed, Carolina Financial and First South will also be
obligated to pay certain investment banking, legal and accounting fees, and related expenses in connection with the merger, which
could negatively impact results of operations when incurred. In addition, neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of
having completed the merger. If the merger is not completed, Carolina Financial and First South cannot assure their respective
stockholders that additional risks will not materialize or not materially adversely affect the business, results of operations and stock
prices of Carolina Financial and First South.

 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
preliminary and the actual financial condition and results of operations of Carolina Financial after the merger may differ
materially.

 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for

illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Carolina Financial’s actual financial condition or results of
operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information reflect adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the First South identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this
document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the
assets and liabilities of First South as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting
adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more information, see “Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

We may fail to realize the cost savings estimated for the merger.
 
Carolina Financial expects to achieve cost savings from the merger when the two companies have been fully integrated. The

cost savings estimates assume the ability to combine the businesses of Carolina Financial and First South in a manner that permits
those cost savings to be realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or if Carolina Financial is not able to successfully combine the
two companies, the anticipated cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

 
The merger may fail to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes, resulting in a stockholder’s recognition of
taxable gain or loss in respect of all of his or her First South common stock.

 
Carolina Financial and First South intend for the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of

the Code. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) will not be asked to provide a ruling on the matter. Carolina Financial and First South
will, as a condition to closing, obtain an opinion from Carolina Financial’s counsel that the merger will constitute a reorganization for
federal income tax purposes. However, this opinion does not bind the IRS or prevent the IRS from adopting a contrary position. If the
merger fails to qualify as a reorganization, First South stockholders generally would recognize gain or loss on each share of First South
common stock surrendered in an amount equal to the difference between the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in that share and the fair
market value of the Carolina Financial common stock plus any cash received in exchange for that share upon completion of the merger.
If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, First South stockholders may recognize taxable gain (but not loss) with respect to the
amount of cash received (i) upon completion of the merger in exchange for their fractional shares of Carolina Financial common stock,
or (ii) in the event Carolina Financial elects to pay an upward price adjustment in cash.

 
Risks Relating to Carolina Financial’s and First South’s respective businesses.

 
You should read and consider risk factors specific to Carolina Financial’s business that will also affect the combined company

after the merger. These risks are described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Carolina Financial’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in other documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You should also read and consider risk factors specific to First South’s business that will also affect the combined
company after the merger. These risks are described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in First South’s Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 and in other documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Please see “Where You Can Find More Information” for the location of information incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

· changes in economic conditions, either nationally or regionally and especially in Carolina Financial’s primary market
areas, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality;

· changes in interest rates, including an impact on Carolina Financial’s margin or a decline in its mortgage production and a
decrease in the profitability of it mortgage banking operations;

· greater than expected losses due to higher credit losses generally and specifically because losses in the sectors of Carolina
Financial’s loan portfolio secured by real estate are greater than expected due to economic factors, including, but not
limited to, declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in payment
behavior or other factors;

· changes in the amount of Carolina Financial’s loan portfolio collateralized by real estate and weaknesses in the South
Carolina, eastern and central North Carolina and national real estate markets;

· the adequacy of the level of Carolina Financial’s allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions
required in future periods;

· changes occurring in business conditions and inflation;
· increased funding costs due to market illiquidity, increased competition for funding, or increased regulatory requirements

with regard to funding;
· Carolina Financial’s business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate, resulting in a

material interruption in, or disruption to, business and a negative impact on results of operations;

applicable to it business;

· estimates and estimate methodologies used in preparing Carolina Financial’s consolidated financial statements and
determining option exercise prices; and

· other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Carolina Financial’s filings with the SEC.

Because of these and other risks and uncertainties, Carolina Financial’s or First South’s actual future results may be materially
different from the results indicated by any forward-looking statements. In addition, Carolina Financial’s and First South’s past results
of operations do not necessarily indicate their future results. Therefore, both companies caution you not to place undue reliance on their
forward-looking information and statements. Neither company undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

All forward-looking statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are based on information available to Carolina
Financial and First South as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Although both companies believe that the expectations
reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, neither company can guarantee you that these expectations will be
achieved. Both companies undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

THE FIRST SOUTH PROPOSALS
 

First South Proposal 1 – Approval of the Merger Agreement
 
At the First South special meeting, the First South stockholders will be asked to approve the merger agreement. Holders of

First South common stock should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the Annexes, for
more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

 
After careful consideration, the First South board of directors unanimously adopted the merger agreement, authorized and

approved the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined the merger agreement and the merger
to be advisable and in the best interests of First South and its stockholders.

 
The First South board of directors unanimously recommends that First South stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal

to approve the merger agreement.
 

First South Proposal 2 – First South Merger-Related Compensation Proposal
 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act require that First South seek a nonbinding

advisory vote from its stockholders to approve the “golden parachute” compensation that its named executive officers will receive in
connection with the merger discussed in “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers, Employees, and Directors of First South in the
Merger.” As required by these provisions, First South is asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption of the following resolution:

 
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to First South’s named executive

officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the table entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation” pursuant
to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, including the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements or understandings
pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED.”
 
The vote with respect to this proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on First South, Carolina Financial, or the

combined company. Therefore, regardless of whether First South stockholders approve this proposal, if the merger agreement is
approved by the stockholders and completed, the “golden parachute” compensation will still be paid to such named executive officers
to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of such compensation contracts and arrangements. Approval of this proposal is not a
condition to the closing of the merger.

 
The First South board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the First South merger-

related compensation proposal.
 

First South Proposal 3 – First South Adjournment Proposal
 
The First South special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place if there are insufficient votes represented at the

First South special meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the First South special meeting or if there are
insufficient votes necessary to obtain the approval of Proposal 1.

 
First South requests that its stockholders authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the First South board of directors on a

discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the First South special meeting to another time or place, if determined necessary or
appropriate by First South, to solicit additional proxies (including the solicitation of proxies from First South stockholders who have
previously voted). Approval of this proposal is not a condition to the closing of the merger.

 
The First South board of directors unanimously recommends that First South stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal

to adjourn the First South special meeting, if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies.

THE CAROLINA FINANCIAL SPECIAL MEETING
 

Date, Time and Place

At the close of business on the record date for the Carolina Financial special meeting, Carolina Financial directors and

executive officers and their affiliates were entitled to vote 1,568,005 shares of Carolina Financial common stock or approximately
9.59% of the shares of Carolina Financial common stock outstanding on that date.

 
Quorum and Adjournment

 
No business may be transacted at the Carolina Financial special meeting unless a quorum is present. Stockholders who hold

shares representing at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Carolina Financial special meeting must be present in person
or by proxy to constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the chairman may adjourn the meeting to solicit additional proxies. In
addition, if fewer shares are voted than the number of shares required to obtain the necessary Carolina Financial stockholder approvals,
then the special meeting may be adjourned to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies, if the approval of a majority of the
votes cast at the special meeting on the Carolina Financial adjournment proposal is obtained.

 
No notice of an adjourned meeting need be given if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the special

meeting unless, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At any adjourned meeting, all proxies will be voted
in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have
been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the adjourned meeting.

 
All shares of Carolina Financial common stock represented at the Carolina Financial special meeting, either in person or by

proxy, including failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence
or absence of a quorum.

 
Required Vote

 
The required votes to approve the Carolina Financial proposals are as follows:
 
· The approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of

Carolina Financial common stock entitled to vote at the Carolina Financial special meeting. Failures to vote, broker non-
votes and abstentions will have the same effect as votes against this proposal.

 
· The approval of the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial common stock to First South stockholders in connection with

the merger requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal at the Carolina Financial special meeting,
assuming a quorum. Failures to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the vote for this proposal.

 
· The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal at the

Carolina Financial special meeting, regardless of whether or not there is a quorum. Failures to vote, broker non-votes and
abstentions will have no effect on the vote for this proposal.

 
Voting of Proxies by Holders of Record

 
If you were a record holder of Carolina Financial common stock at the close of business on the record date of the Carolina

Financial special meeting, a proxy card is enclosed for your use. Carolina Financial requests that you vote your shares as promptly as
possible by (i) visiting the internet site listed on the Carolina Financial proxy card, (ii) calling the toll-free number listed on the
Carolina Financial proxy card or (iii) submitting your Carolina Financial proxy card by mail by using the provided self-addressed,
stamped envelope. Information and applicable deadlines for voting through the internet or by telephone are set forth on the enclosed
proxy card. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly executed, the shares of Carolina Financial common stock represented
by it will be voted at the Carolina Financial special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting in accordance with the
instructions contained in the proxy card. Your internet or telephone vote authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same
manner as if you had marked, signed and returned a proxy card.

If a proxy is returned without an indication as to how the shares of Carolina Financial common stock represented are to be
voted with regard to a particular proposal, the Carolina Financial common stock represented by the proxy will be voted in accordance
with the recommendation of the Carolina Financial board of directors and, therefore, “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial common stock to First South stockholders in
connection with the merger, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

 
As of the date hereof, the Carolina Financial board of directors has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for

consideration at the Carolina Financial special meeting and that would be required to be set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or the related proxy card other than the matters set forth in Carolina Financial’s Notice of Special Meeting of
Stockholders. If any other matter is properly presented at the Carolina Financial special meeting for consideration, the persons named
in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their discretion on such matter.

 
Your vote is important. If you were a record holder of Carolina Financial common stock on the record date of the

Carolina Financial special meeting, please sign and return the enclosed proxy card, or vote via the internet or telephone,
regardless of whether or not you plan to attend the Carolina Financial special meeting in person. Proxies submitted through the
specified internet website or by phone must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 23, 2017.

 
Shares Held in Street Name

 
If you hold shares of Carolina Financial common stock through a stock brokerage account, bank or other nominee, you are

considered the “beneficial holder” of the shares held for you in what is known as “street name.” The “record holder” of such shares is
your broker, bank or other nominee, and not you, and you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to
vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Please note that you may not
vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Carolina Financial or by voting in person at the Carolina Financial
special meeting unless you have a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Please also note that
brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Carolina Financial common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a
proxy to Carolina Financial to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.

 
If you are a Carolina Financial stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your

shares, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of the Carolina Financial proposals.
 

Attending the Meeting; Voting in Person
 
Only Carolina Financial stockholders, their duly appointed proxies and invited guests may attend the meeting. All attendees

must present government-issued photo identification (such as a driver’s license or passport) for admittance. The additional items, if
any, that attendees must bring depend on whether they are stockholders of record, beneficial owners, or proxy holders.

 
A Carolina Financial stockholder who holds shares directly registered in such stockholder’s name with Carolina Financial’s

transfer agent, Computershare, and who wishes to attend the special meeting in person should bring government-issued photo
identification.

 
A stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee (referred to in this joint

proxy statement/prospectus as a “beneficial owner”) and who wishes to attend the special meeting in person must bring proof of
beneficial ownership as of the record date, such as a letter from the broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that is the record owner of
such beneficial owner’s shares, a brokerage account statement or the voting instruction form provided by the broker.

A person who holds a validly executed proxy entitling such person to vote on behalf of a record owner of Carolina Financial
shares and who wishes to attend the special meeting in person must bring the validly executed proxy naming such person as the proxy
holder, signed by the Carolina Financial stockholder, and proof of the signing stockholder’s record ownership as of the record date.

 
No cameras, recording equipment or other electronic devices will be allowed in the meeting room. Failure to provide the

requested documents at the door or failure to comply with the procedures for the special meeting may prevent stockholders from being
admitted to the Carolina Financial special meeting.

 
Revocation of Proxies

 
A Carolina Financial stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted at the meeting by taking any of the

following four actions:
 
· delivering written notice of revocation to Carolina Financial’s Corporate Secretary, M. J. Huggins III, 288 Meeting Street,

Charleston, South Carolina 29401;

· delivering a proxy card bearing a later date than the proxy that you wish to revoke;

· casting a subsequent vote via telephone or the internet, as described above; or

· attending the meeting and voting in person.

Merely attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must cast a subsequent vote at the meeting using
forms provided for that purpose. Your last valid vote that we receive before or at the special meeting is the vote that will be counted.

 
Solicitation of Proxies

 
Carolina Financial is soliciting proxies for the Carolina Financial special meeting from its stockholders. In accordance with

the merger agreement, Carolina Financial will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies from its stockholders, including the cost of
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by Carolina
Financial’s officers, directors and regular employees, without additional remuneration, by personal interview, telephone or other means
of communication.

 
Carolina Financial will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy

solicitation materials to beneficial owners of Carolina Financial common stock. Carolina Financial may reimburse these brokerage
houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy materials.

street name by returning a proxy card directly to First South or by voting in person at the First South special meeting unless you have a
“legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Please also note that brokers, banks or other nominees
who hold shares of First South common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to First South to vote those shares
without specific instructions from their customers.

 
If you are a First South stockholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares,

your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of the First South proposals.

Computershare, and who wishes to attend the special meeting in person should bring government-issued photo identification.

Revocation of Proxies
 
If you are a First South record holder (i.e., you hold your shares directly instead of through a brokerage account, bank or other

nominee) and you change your mind after you return your proxy, you may revoke it and change your vote at any time before the polls
close at the First South special meeting. You may do this by:

 
· delivering written notice of revocation to First South’s Corporate Secretary, William L. Wall, 1311 Carolina Avenue

Washington, North Carolina 27889 

· delivering a proxy card bearing a later date than the proxy that you wish to revoke;

· casting a subsequent vote via telephone or the internet; or

· attending the meeting and voting in person.

Merely attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must cast a subsequent vote at the meeting using
forms provided for that purpose.

 
If you hold your shares through a brokerage account, you must contact your brokerage firm to revoke your proxy.
 

Solicitation of Proxies
 
First South is soliciting proxies for the First South special meeting from its stockholders. In accordance with the merger

agreement, First South will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies from its stockholders, including the cost of mailing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by First South’s officers, directors and
regular employees, without additional remuneration, by personal interview, telephone or other means of communication.

 
First South will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation

materials to beneficial owners of First South common stock. First South may reimburse these brokerage houses, custodians, nominees
and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy materials.

 
To help assure the presence in person or by proxy of the largest number of stockholders possible, we have engaged Morrow

Sodali LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, which we refer to as “Morrow”, to solicit proxies on First South’s behalf. We have agreed to pay
to Morrow a proxy solicitation fee of $10,000. We will also reimburse Morrow for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

THE MERGER
 

The descriptions of the terms and conditions of the merger, the merger agreement, and any related documents in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, to the registration statement, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, and to the
exhibits to the registration statement. 

 
General

 
The Carolina Financial board of directors is using this joint proxy statement/prospectus to solicit proxies from the holders of

Carolina Financial common stock for use at the Carolina Financial special stockholders’ meeting. At the same time, the First South
board of directors is using this joint proxy statement/prospectus to solicit proxies from the holders of First South common stock for use
at the First South special stockholders’ meeting.

 
At the Carolina Financial special stockholders’ meeting and the First South special stockholders’ meeting, holders of Carolina

Financial common stock and holders of First South common stock, respectively, will be asked to vote upon the adoption of the merger
agreement, among other things. The merger will not be completed unless Carolina Financial’s stockholders and First South’s
stockholders adopt the merger agreement and, by doing so, approve the proposed merger.

 
Effects of the Merger

 
At the effective time of the merger, First South will merge with and into Carolina Financial. Carolina Financial will be the

surviving entity following the merger.
 
In the merger, each outstanding share of First South common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.5200 shares of

Carolina Financial common stock, together with cash paid in lieu of any fractional share of Carolina Financial common stock. If the
closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is greater than $35.14 just prior to closing of the merger and it has outperformed the
NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, the exchange ratio will be decreased automatically based upon
the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to
closing and it has underperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, First South can terminate
the merger agreement unless Carolina Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash consideration to make up the
difference, based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. Carolina Financial stockholders will continue to hold their existing
Carolina Financial shares.

Background of the Merger
 

As part of the ongoing oversight and management of their respective companies, the Carolina Financial board of directors and
the First South board of directors each regularly review and assess their respective companies’ long-term strategic goals and
opportunities, and consider ways to enhance their respective company’s performance and prospects in light of competitive and other
relevant developments, all with the goal of enhancing stockholder value. For each company, these reviews have included periodic
discussions with respect to strategic alternatives, including potential business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions.

Members of First South’s senior management team have regularly met with representatives of various investment banking
firms experienced in the banking industry to discuss market conditions, current industry trends, First South’s performance, and
potential transaction opportunities. In June 2016, First South engaged Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P., or Sandler, to conduct a
strategic review and to determine an approximate valuation of First South. The First South board decided to engage Sandler following
a series of events beginning in December 2015. On December 18, 2015, First South received a letter from a stockholder dated
December 16, 2015 requesting that First South include in its proxy statement for its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders a proposal for
a stockholder resolution recommending that the First South board take the necessary steps to achieve a sale, merger, or other
disposition of First South. The First South board opposed the proposal and recommended that stockholders vote against it at the 2016
annual meeting held on May 26, 2016. The proposal was defeated. Although the First South board did not believe the time was
appropriate to pursue a strategic transaction in the spring of 2016, it thought it prudent to obtain an independent review and valuation in
light of the stockholder proposal and its potential impact in the market. The First South board wished to be prepared in the event it was
approached to consider merger discussions in the wake of the defeated stockholder proposal. Representatives of Sandler presented and
discussed their completed strategic review and valuation with the First South board at a meeting on July 11, 2016. Following this
meeting, First South’s management and board determined that the appropriate course of action was to take steps to improve First
South’s financial results while remaining open to discussions with potential strategic partners should such opportunities arise.

On September 30, 2016, First South’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bruce W. Elder, spoke with a representative of
another financial institution, which we refer to as Bank A. At the time, Bank A was actively involved in acquiring another financial
institution, but indicated it had an interest in acquiring First South and expected to be able to entertain more serious discussions in the
first quarter of 2017. On October 5, 2016, another representative of Bank A indicated to a representative of Raymond James that Bank
A would be willing to offer consideration equivalent to $12.00 per common share of First South.

On the morning of October 13, 2016, representatives of another financial institution, which we refer to as Bank B, contacted
Mr. Elder and requested a meeting that afternoon. At this meeting, the representatives of Bank B delivered a written indication of
interest outlining Bank B’s desire to acquire First South for $11.50 per share in cash or a combination of cash and preferred stock of
Bank B. Mr. Elder informed the chairman of the First South board, Frederick N. Holscher, of this development on the evening of
October 13, 2016. On October 14, 2016, Mr. Elder spoke by telephone with a representative of Bank B. Mr. Elder informed Bank B
that the First South board would consider Bank B’s indication of interest at a special meeting to be held on October 17, 2016. However,
based on the recently completed valuation analysis, Mr. Elder indicated that the consideration offered by Bank B was not likely to be
sufficient. The representative of Bank B verbally increased the offer to $12.50 per share in cash or a combination of cash and preferred
stock in Bank B. Bank B requested a response from First South no later than October 27, 2016.

The First South board held a special meeting on October 17, 2016. Representatives of Raymond James and of Wyrick Robbins
Yates & Ponton LLP, or Wyrick Robbins, First South’s outside legal counsel, were also in attendance. The First South board considered
and discussed the preliminary offers of Bank A and Bank B. In light of these offers, the First South board directed Raymond James to
perform a thorough market analysis using financial data as of September 30, 2016, with the goal of providing the First South board
with an up-to-date estimate of how First South might be valued in a merger or acquisition situation. Mr. Elder requested that Bank B
extend its deadline for a response from First South beyond the October 27 date previously indicated by Bank B. Bank B agreed to
extend the deadline to November 15, 2016. The First South board agreed to reconvene on November 14, 2016 to review Raymond
James’s analysis and formulate a response to Bank B. On November 2, 2016, First South formally engaged Raymond James to perform
the requested analysis and to serve as First South’s financial advisor in connection with any strategic transaction involving First South.

The First South board held a special meeting on November 14, 2016. Representatives of Raymond James attended the meeting
in order to present the results of their market analysis of First South and its potential valuation in a merger or acquisition transaction. In
the opinion of Raymond James, First South’s value in a potential merger or acquisition transaction was between $13.00 and $15.50 per
share. Following discussion and based on the valuation analysis, the First South board elected not to pursue any further discussions
with Bank B at the price level proposed by Bank B in its October 13, 2016 communication with Mr. Elder. The First South board
indicated to Bank B that it would reconsider its strategic alternatives after First South’s 2016 financial results were available.

Given that (1) the First South board believed that an offer of a combination of cash and preferred stock was not in the best
interest of stockholders and (2) that the First South board believed Bank B was likely to make additional overtures in the first quarter of
2017, the First South board also decided to explore opportunities with other financial institutions in an effort to maximize stockholder
value. Specifically, the First South board instructed Raymond James to contact Carolina Financial and arrange a meeting between Mr.
Elder and representatives of Carolina Financial’s management team. As part of its analysis, Raymond James had identified Carolina
Financial as an emerging acquirer and potential merger partner for First South. Raymond James believed Carolina Financial would be
able to offer consideration on the higher end of the valuation range of $13.00 to $15.50 per share.

In early November 2016, an electronic data room was established by Raymond James for the purpose of housing certain
information regarding First South to be used by potential merger partners in their due diligence investigations of First South.

The First South board also discussed Bank A at its November 14, 2016, meeting. The analysis prepared by Raymond James
indicated that Bank A had the ability to pay a per share acquisition price in the lower half of the valuation range. After discussion, the
First South board decided to pursue discussions with Carolina Financial prior to re-engaging with Bank A. At this point in time, the
First South board’s goal was to explore an all-stock alternative to a potential future offer that Bank B might make of cash or mixed
stock and cash consideration. Since the analysis indicated Carolina Financial had the most capacity to pay, the First South board
decided to explore that opportunity, while leaving open the option of renewing contact with Bank A.

On November 18, 2016, First South entered into a confidentiality agreement with a third financial institution, which we refer
to as Bank C. Under the terms of the confidentiality agreement, Bank C agreed to not to disclose First South’s confidential information
and also agreed not to solicit to employ any of First South’s employees for a period of one year from the date of the agreement. The
confidentiality agreement also contained a “standstill” provision whereby Bank C agreed that for a period of one year from the date of
the agreement, it would not, without First South’s prior written consent, (i) either in its own capacity or as part of a group, acquire,
offer to acquire, or agree to acquire more than 5% of the outstanding shares of First South’s common stock or securities exercisable for
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of First South’s common stock; (ii) make a stockholder proposal or participate in any
solicitation of proxies to vote any of First South’s voting securities against any proposal supported by First South’s management; (iii)
seek to “control” (as defined in federal banking regulations) the management, board of directors, or policies of First South; (iv) seek or
propose any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale or purchase of assets or securities, or similar transaction of or involving
First South or any of its subsidiaries; (v) have any discussions or enter into any arrangements, understandings, or agreements (whether
written or oral) with, or advise, finance, assist or encourage any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing, or make any
investment in any other person that engages, or offers or proposes to engage, in any of the foregoing; (vi) make any publicly disclosed
proposal regarding any of the foregoing; or (vii) assist any other party, directly or indirectly, in taking any action which would be
prohibited by the foregoing provisions.

On December 14, 2016, First South received a letter from a stockholder, dated December 14, 2016, requesting that First South
include in its proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders a proposal for a stockholder resolution recommending that
the First South board take the necessary steps to achieve a sale, merger, or other disposition of First South. This request was
substantially identical to the request that led to the stockholder proposal being included in the proxy materials for First South’s 2016
annual meeting of stockholders.

In December of 2016, Mr. Elder contacted Bank C to determine if Bank C had any interest in a potential business combination
transaction with First South. After consideration, Bank C elected not to pursue a transaction with First South.

On December 29, 2016, First South entered into a confidentiality agreement with Bank A. The terms of the confidentiality
agreement, including the standstill provision, were similar to those contained in the confidentiality agreement between First South and
Bank C described above.

Following the U.S. presidential election on November 8, 2016, and continuing into the new year, there was a general increase
in the prices of financial institution stocks and a material increase in valuations in the financial institutions sector. This economic
environment served as a backdrop for the First South board’s continued consideration of its strategic alternatives in 2017.

On January 13, 2017, representatives of Bank A verbally indicated that Bank A would be willing to pay $12.00 to $15.50 per
share in an all-stock transaction to acquire First South. At a January 26, 2017 meeting, the First South board agreed to a meeting with
representatives of Bank A to discuss Bank A’s verbal indication of interest in acquiring First South. Also during this time, Mr. Elder
had been in contact with Jerold L. Rexroad, President and Chief Executive Officer of Carolina Financial. Mr. Rexroad indicated that
Carolina Financial remained highly interested in a transaction with First South, but would not be in a position to deliver a written
indication of interest until later in the first quarter of 2017 due to an ongoing acquisition transaction. The First South board approved of
Mr. Elder scheduling additional meetings with Mr. Rexroad.

On February 10, 2017, the First South board and representatives from Raymond James met with an executive officer of Bank
A to gain a better understanding of Bank A’s long-term strategic plans and further discuss the benefits of a business combination.
Following this presentation, the parties attempted to schedule a meeting between Mr. Elder and the executive officer of Bank A to
whom Mr. Elder would report in the event First South merged with Bank A. Due to scheduling conflicts, this meeting never occurred.
Bank A subsequently announced it was entering into a transaction with another financial institution.

On February 16, 2017, First South entered into a confidentiality agreement with a fourth financial institution, which we refer
to as Bank D. The standstill provision of the confidentiality agreement with Bank D was different from the standstill provisions in the
confidentiality agreements with Banks A and C. Under the standstill provision in the agreement with Bank D, Bank D agreed that, for a
period of one year from the date of the agreement, it would not, without the prior written consent of First South: (i) either in its own
capacity or as part of a group, acquire, offer to acquire or agree to acquire by purchase, tender offer or otherwise more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of common stock of First South; (ii) seek to “control” (as defined in federal banking regulations) the management,
board of directors, or policies of First South; (iii) seek or propose any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale or purchase of
assets or securities, or similar transaction of or involving First South or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) make a stockholder proposal or
participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote any voting securities of First South against any proposal supported by First South’s
management regarding any of the foregoing; (v) have any discussions or enter into any arrangements, understandings or agreements
(written or oral) with, or advise, finance, assist or encourage, any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing; (vi) make any
publicly disclosed proposal regarding any of the foregoing; or (vii) assist any other party, directly or indirectly in taking any action
which would be prohibited by the foregoing provisions. The confidentiality agreement with Bank D also provided that the restrictions
in the standstill provision would terminate if First South entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, or publicly announced that
it planned to enter into, a transaction involving all or a controlling portion of its equity securities or all or substantially all of its assets,
whether by merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer, recapitalization, restructuring, sale, equity issuance
or otherwise. Mr. Elder met with a representative of Bank D on February 16, 2017, at the request of Bank D. Discussions were held
regarding a possible merger of equals of First South and Bank D. Because of timing with respect to other ongoing discussions,
representatives of First South and Bank D discussed pricing expectations and quickly determined that further conversations were not
likely to lead to any meaningful results.

On February 22, 2017, the First South board and representatives from Raymond James met with Mr. Rexroad and William A.
Gehman, III, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Carolina Financial, to gain a better understanding of Carolina
Financial’s long-term strategic plans and to further discuss the benefits of a business combination.

On February 23, 2017, the First South board met and was joined by representatives of Raymond James. Raymond James had
prepared an analysis comparing potential transactions between First South and Bank A or Carolina Financial. At the time of this
meeting, Carolina Financial had verbally indicated it would be willing to pay $15.00 to $15.50 per share to acquire First South and
Bank A had verbally indicated it would be willing to pay $15.50 to $17.00 per share. The First South board engaged in discussion with
Raymond James on the merits of a potential transaction with either Bank A or Carolina Financial. Following this discussion, the First
South board instructed Raymond James to inform Carolina Financial of Bank A’s verbal indication of interest with a range up to $17.00
per share and to provide Carolina Financial with an opportunity to reconsider its verbal indication. The First South board also
instructed Raymond James to inform Bank A that it would reconvene at a future date to consider its strategic alternatives.

As a result of Raymond James’s communication with Carolina Financial subsequent to the February 23, 2017 board meeting,
Carolina Financial requested access to a significant amount of additional information regarding First South. In late February, an
additional electronic data room was opened and access to given solely to Carolina Financial. On February 28, 2017, Mr. Elder and
Scott C. McLean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of First South, met with Messrs. Rexroad and Gehman, along
with a representative of Raymond James, to discuss, among other things, due diligence findings as well as operational and corporate
integration issues. Following this additional investigation and discussion, Carolina Financial verbally indicated a proposed exchange
ratio of 0.5150 to 0.5175 shares of Carolina Financial common stock for each share of First South common stock.

On March 12, 2017, a special meeting of the First South board was convened for the purpose of determining whether First
South should pursue a path to remain independent or to actively pursue a partnership with Carolina Financial or Bank A.
Representatives from Raymond James made a presentation outlining the future value of First South on a standalone basis compared to
the value as a partner with the other banks. The board determined that a partnership with either Bank A or Carolina Financial had the



9/17/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm

potential to increase stockholder value more than First South might accomplish as an independent bank. Raymond James presented an
analysis comparing the two verbal indications. Bank A’s verbal indication was converted to a range of fixed exchange ratios. The
analysis, using each company’s 10-day average closing price as of March 10, resulted in a per share price range for Carolina Financial
of $15.62 to $15.70 and a range of $15.14 to $16.60 for Bank A. Both verbal indications were subject to due diligence findings. Due to
the amount of due diligence conducted by Carolina Financial, the resulting tightening of the range of the proposed exchange ratio and
Carolina Financial’s current and future projected performance, the board determined that pursuing a merger transaction with Carolina
Financial was in the best interest of stockholders.

The First South board next met on March 23, 2017. Representatives of Raymond James presented a draft letter of intent from
Carolina Financial dated March 17, 2017 for the acquisition of First South and provided a more detailed overview of a potential
transaction with Carolina Financial, including price protection features, representation on the board of the combined company,
treatment of First South equity awards, personnel issues, and the creation of a Carolina Financial regional advisory board for North
Carolina. The First South board directed Raymond James to discuss and clarify these issues with Carolina Financial in anticipation of
Carolina Financial submitting a written letter of intent to acquire First South in the near future.

On April 3, 2017, Carolina Financial provided Raymond James with a non-binding letter of intent to acquire First South. The
financial terms provided for an all-stock transaction with an exchange ratio of 0.5150 to 0.5175 shares of Carolina Financial common
stock for each share of First South common stock. This exchange ratio would be finalized subject to completion of Carolina Financial’s
due diligence on First South. The letter indicated that the merger consideration would include possible adjustments based on 15%
thresholds for (A) the trading price of Carolina Financial’s common stock and (B) the price performance of Carolina Financial’s
common stock against the Nasdaq Bank Index. The letter further indicated that two directors of First South would be invited to join the
Carolina Financial board and that the other First South directors would be asked to serve on an Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board
for CresCom Bank. The letter also contained an exclusivity provision. This provision required that First South refrain from (A)
participating in any negotiations or soliciting, initiating or seeking to encourage submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from any
potential buyer of First South; (B) entering into any agreement or taking any action that by its terms or effect was intended to adversely
affect the ability of Carolina Financial and First South to consummate a merger; or (C) furnishing or authorizing any agent or
representative to furnish any information concerning the proposed merger to any party. The exclusivity period began on the date the
proposal was accepted by First South and ended on the earlier of (A) 45 days thereafter or (B) Carolina Financial’s written notification
to First South that it did not intend to consummate the proposed transaction. During the exclusivity period, First South was required to
notify Carolina Financial of any unsolicited inquiries, proposals, or offers from any other potential buyer of First South. Carolina
Financial requested a response to its letter no later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 7, 2017. First South accepted Carolina
Financial’s non-binding letter of intent on April 4, 2017 at a special meeting of the First South board.

On April 28, 2017, a representative of Bank B contacted Raymond James and Mr. Elder by e-mail. The representative
indicated Bank B’s desire to continue discussions regarding the acquisition of First South and that Bank B would like to increase its
proposed consideration and further indicated that Bank B would deliver a letter containing its updated proposal on or after May 16,
2017.

The expiration date of the exclusivity period under the Carolina Financial letter of intent was May 19, 2017. On May 4, 2017,
the First South board met to consider Carolina Financial’s request to extend the exclusivity period to June 10, 2017. In light of the
verbal indication from Bank B that an updated offer proposal would be forth coming on May 16, 2017, the board elected to not extend
the exclusivity period in order to potentially enter into conversations with Bank B.

On May 16, 2017, Bank B delivered a non-binding indication of interest letter to First South. The letter indicated that each
share of First South’s common stock would be converted into the right to receive consideration of between $14.50 and $17.50 per
share. The consideration would be, at the holder’s option, in the form of cash, Bank B preferred stock (5.75% fixed rate dividend for
ten years, non-callable for ten years), or a combination of cash and Bank B preferred stock. The specific amount of the consideration
was subject to reduction and would be established at the conclusion of Bank B’s due diligence. The letter had an expiration date of 5:30
p.m. on May 31, 2017 if not accepted prior to then by First South.

Upon receipt, First South reviewed Bank B’s indication of interest letter with its financial and legal advisors. Per the terms of
the Carolina Financial letter of intent, First South also notified Carolina Financial in writing of the existence of Bank’s B’s indication
of interest and provided a summary of its material terms to Carolina Financial.

Also on May 16, 2017, Raymond James received an updated letter of intent from Carolina Financial offering a fixed exchange
ratio of 0.5163 shares of Carolina Financial common stock for each share of First South common stock. The letter also asked for an
exclusivity period running from the date the proposal was accepted until June 12, 2017. First South did not accept this letter of intent
and allowed the exclusivity period under the original letter of intent to expire on May 19, 2017.

On May 22, 2017, after the expiration of the exclusivity period with Carolina Financial, Mr. Elder, along with representatives
of Raymond James and Wyrick Robbins, met with representatives of Bank B to discuss Bank B’s indication of interest and a proposed
acquisition of First South by Bank B.

On May 24, 2017, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP, or Nelson Mullins, legal counsel to Carolina Financial,
provided a draft merger agreement to Wyrick Robbins. The following day, May 25, 2017, Nelson Mullins provided draft employment
agreement for Mr. Elder and for Cornelius J. Sullivan to Wyrick Robbins. Over the succeeding days, First South and Carolina
Financial, with the assistance of their respective legal counsel and financial advisors, negotiated the provisions of the merger agreement
and ancillary documents. Key terms negotiated between the first draft of the merger agreement delivered on May 24, 2017 and the draft
of the merger agreement presented to the First South board on June 9, 2017 included, among others: (A) covenants regarding the
conduct of First South’s business prior to the closing of the merger, (B) the amount of the termination fee payable by First South if the
merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances, (C) the circumstances in which the merger agreement may be
terminated, and (D) the representations and warranties of First South and Carolina Financial.

On May 25, 2017, the First South board met with its advisors from Raymond James and Wyrick Robbins to discuss the May
22nd meeting with Bank B, the draft definitive merger agreement received from Carolina Financial on May 24th and to receive current
information on the general state of bank mergers and acquisitions in the Carolinas. Over an eight-day period from the end of April to
the beginning of May, four bank mergers had occurred involving North Carolina banks which impacted certain merger pricing metrics
since the board last reviewed merger and acquisition data. The board concluded that based on the amount of time that had transpired
since negotiations with Carolina Financial began, the growth in First South’s balance sheet and earnings projected for the second
quarter of 2017 and the pricing for recently announced merger transactions, that the fixed exchange ratio of 0.5163 was too low and
instructed Raymond James to request that Carolina financial consider increasing the exchange ratio to 0.5263.

On May 26, 2017, Carolina Financial verbally agreed to increase the exchange ratio to 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial
common stock for each share of First South common stock. The board of First South agreed to the verbal indication. Carolina Financial
delivered a letter to Raymond James wherein it reaffirmed the terms of its letter of intent dated April 3, 2017. The May 26 letter
proposed an exchange ratio of 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial common stock for each share of First South common stock in an all-
stock transaction. The May 26 letter also contained an exclusivity provision similar to that contained in Carolina Financial’s April 3
letter. The exclusivity period began on the date the proposal was accepted by First South and ended on the earlier of (A) June 10, 2017
or (B) Carolina Financial’s written notification to First South that it did not intend to consummate the proposed transaction. The
exclusivity provision was subject to an automatic ten-day extension if Carolina Financial and First South were still actively pursuing a
transaction on June 10, 2017.

On May 31, 2017, the deadline for First South to respond to Bank B’s indication of interest expired. After consulting with the
First South board and its financial and legal advisors, First South’s management had determined to allow Bank B’s indication of
interest to expire. The reasons for this decision are summarized below.

On June 1, 2017, First South accepted Carolina Financial’s May 26 updated letter of intent.

Subsequently, Carolina Financial and First South also continued to conduct due diligence and Messrs. Elder and Sullivan
continued to negotiate and finalize their respective employment agreements with Carolina Financial. On June 2, 2017, representatives
of First South and Raymond James conducted due diligence interviews of representatives of Carolina Financial.

On June 5, 2017, the First South board received a letter from Bank B. The letter referenced Bank B’s May 16, 2017 indication
of interest to acquire First South and the fact that First South had allowed the indication of interest to expire. In the June 5 letter, Bank
B reiterated its interest in First South and stated it was prepared to make an offer to acquire First South at a price of $17.00 per share to
be paid either in all cash or, as previously indicated, in the form of a combination of cash and Bank B preferred stock. The amount of
the consideration was subject to Bank B’s due diligence investigation of First South. Bank B also indicated in its letter that it intended
to publicly announce its proposal to acquire First South on June 15, 2017. As required by the letter of intent with Carolina Financial,
First South notified Carolina Financial of Bank B’s letter and reviewed the letter with First South’s financial and legal advisors.

On the afternoon of June 7, 2017, the First South board held a meeting at which the potential merger transaction with Carolina
Financial and the proposal from Bank B were discussed. It was made clear at the outset of the meeting that the First South board would
not be voting to approve any transaction at this meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to provide the First South board with an
opportunity to review, consider, and discuss the situation. Representatives from Raymond James and Wyrick Robbins were also present
at this meeting and provided an update on the status of merger discussions. Raymond James presented a financial analysis of the
proposed merger with Carolina Financial and a description and analysis of the price protection features of the merger agreement.
Wyrick Robbins reviewed the proposed merger agreement with Carolina Financial in detail with the board. The board, with the
assistance of Raymond James and Wyrick Robbins, engaged in extensive discussion of the proposed merger with Carolina Financial
and the advantages and disadvantages of a merger with Carolina Financial as compared to a potential transaction with Bank B. The
board discussed, among other things, the advantages and disadvantages of cash versus stock consideration, the status of due diligence,
the risk of losing the potential transaction with Carolina Financial to pursue a more uncertain potential transaction with Bank B, pro
forma ownership percentages, and tax considerations.

First South and Carolina Financial, with the assistance of their respective advisors, continued negotiation of the merger
agreement. On June 9, 2017, the First South board met and further considered the proposed merger with Carolina Financial and
reviewed the latest draft of the merger agreement. Representatives of Raymond James attended the meeting and representatives of
Wyrick Robbins joined the meeting by telephone. Raymond James presented the financial analysis supporting its fairness opinion,
including a review of selected regional transactions, a review of selected national transactions, an analysis of the proposed
consideration in the form of common stock of Carolina Financial, pro forma ownership percentages, and tax considerations. Based on
this analysis, Raymond James stated it was prepared to deliver a written opinion stating that the proposed exchange ratio in the merger
of 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial common stock for each share of First South’s common stock was fair to First South’s
stockholders from a financial point of view. On June 9, the value of the proposed merger consideration from Carolina Financial was
approximately $16.89 per share, based on Carolina Financial’s closing price that day. The closing price of First South common stock
on that day was $14.60.

The First South board also discussed the indication of interest and follow-up letter from Bank B. After having discussed and
considered Bank B’s offer over a period of several weeks and a series of meetings, the First South board determined not to pursue a
transaction with Bank B. The First South board’s decision was based on the following factors, among others:

· The limited potential upside to First South’s stockholders of a cash transaction.

· The illiquidity of any preferred stock consideration.

· The lack of ownership by First South’s stockholders in the combined company on a going-forward basis.
 

· The risk of losing the proposed merger with Carolina Financial, for which due diligence and negotiations were
substantially complete.
 

· Market overlap and anti-competitive concerns that would be present in a transaction with Bank B that are not present in
the proposed merger with Carolina Financial.
 

· The tax consequences to First South’s stockholders of a cash transaction.

Following extensive review and discussion, including consideration of the factors described under “— First South’s Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of First South’s Board of Directors” beginning on page 47, and consideration of the above referenced
presentations, the First South board unanimously voted to approve the merger and the merger agreement with Carolina Financial, and
directed First South’s management to finalize and execute a definitive merger agreement on the terms presented at the meeting.

 
Carolina Financial’s board also met on June 9, 2017 and unanimously approved the merger. At this meeting, KBW reviewed

the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered to the Carolina Financial’s board of directors an opinion to the effect that, as
of that date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Carolina Financial.

 
Carolina Financial and First South executed the merger agreement after their respective board meetings on June 9, 2017 and,

before the financial markets opened on the morning on June 12, 2017, issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the
merger agreement and the terms of the merger.

 
First South’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the First South Board of Directors
 

After careful consideration, First South’s board of directors, at a meeting held on June 9, 2017, unanimously
determined the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby to be fair and in the best interest of First South
and its stockholders. Accordingly, First South’s board of directors adopted and approved the merger agreement and
unanimously recommends that First South’s stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement.
 

In evaluating the merger agreement and reaching its decision to adopt and approve the merger agreement and recommend that
First South’s stockholders approve the merger agreement, First South’s board consulted with First South’s management, as well as its
outside legal and financial advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (not in any relative
order of importance):
 

· First South’s board’s knowledge and understanding of First South’s business, operations, financial condition, asset
quality, earnings and prospects, and of Carolina Financial’s business, operations, financial condition, asset quality,
earnings and prospects, taking into account the presentations made by Carolina Financial officers and information
provided by First South’s financial advisors;
 

· its understanding of Carolina Financial’s commitment to enhancing its strategic position in eastern North Carolina, its
prospects for the future and its projected financial results and First South’s board’s belief that the combined enterprise
would benefit from Carolina Financial’s ability to take advantage of economies of scale and grow in the current economic
environment;

· Carolina Financial’s earnings track record and the market performance of its common stock;

· the ability of First South’s stockholders to benefit from Carolina Financial’s potential growth and stock appreciation since
it is more likely that the combined entity will have superior future earnings and prospects compared to First South’s
earnings and prospects on an independent basis as the result of greater operating efficiencies and better penetration of
commercial and consumer markets;

· the perceived ability of Carolina Financial to complete a merger transaction from a financial and regulatory perspective;

· the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including the exchange ratio and tax treatment, which First South’s
board reviewed with its outside financial and legal advisors, including:

· First South’s ability, under certain circumstances specified in and prior to the time First South’s stockholders
approve the merger agreement (i) to provide non-public information in response to a written acquisition proposal
from a third party and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with a third party making such proposal, if,
in each case, the acquisition proposal was not the result of a material violation of the provisions of the merger
agreement relating to the solicitation of acquisition proposals, and if First South’s board, prior to taking any such
actions, determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
actions would violate First South’s board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law and, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal;

· the fact that the outside date under the merger agreement allows for sufficient time to complete the merger;

· First South’s board’s belief, based on the then-current market price of Carolina Financial common stock, that the

proposed merger with Carolina Financial would generally be a tax-free transaction to First South’s stockholders;

· the level of effort that Carolina Financial must use under the merger agreement to obtain required regulatory
approvals, and the prospects for such approvals being obtained in a timely fashion and without the imposition of
any adverse conditions; and

· its review of the potential costs associated with executing the merger agreement, including change in control,
severance and related costs, as well as estimated advisor fees, which First South’s board concluded were
reasonable and would not affect the advice from, or the work performed by senior management of First South or
First South’s financial advisors in connection with the evaluation of the merger and the merger agreement by
First South’s board;

· the complementary aspects of the First South and Carolina Financial businesses, including customer focus, geographic
coverage, business orientation and compatibility of the companies’ management operating styles;

· the potential expense-saving and revenue-enhancing opportunities in connection with the merger, the related potential
impact on the combined company’s earnings and the fact that the nature of the merger consideration would allow former
First South stockholders to participate in the potential future upside as Carolina Financial stockholders;

· the anticipated effect of the acquisition on First South’s retained employees and the terms of severance for employees
who would not be retained;

· the long-term and short-term interests of First South and its stockholders, and the interests of First South’s employees,
customers, creditors and suppliers, and the community and societal considerations of the communities in which First
South maintains offices;

· the financial analyses provided by Raymond James, First South’s financial advisor, regarding the merger, and its opinion,
delivered to First South’s board on June 9, 2017, that as of that date, the merger consideration to be received under the
terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to First South’s stockholders;

· its knowledge of the current environment in the financial services industry, including national, regional and local
economic conditions, continued industry consolidation, increased regulatory burdens, evolving trends in technology and
increasing nationwide and global competition, the current financial market conditions, the current environment for
community banks, particularly in the Carolinas, and the likely effects of these factors on First South’s and the combined
company’s potential growth, development, productivity, profitability and strategic options, and the historical prices of
First South and Carolina Financial common shares;

· its knowledge of First South’s prospects as an independent entity, including challenges relating to increasing regulatory
burdens and overhead expense, and First South’s ability to increase capital to support growth;

· its knowledge of the strategic alternatives available to First South, including the challenges for organic growth by a
financial institution of First South’s size; and

· its belief that the merger is more favorable to First South’s stockholders than the alternatives to the merger, which belief
was formed based on the careful review undertaken by First South’s board of directors, with the assistance of its
management, outside legal and financial advisors.

With respect to the indication of interest received from Bank B as described above, the First South’s board’s reasons for
pursing the merger with Carolina Financial as opposed to a transaction with Bank B included the following (not in any relative order of
importance):

 
· The limited potential upside to First South’s stockholders of a cash transaction such as the one proposed by Bank B.

· The illiquidity of any preferred stock consideration as was proposed by Bank B.

· The lack of ownership by First South’s stockholders in the combined company on a going-forward basis.

· The risk of losing the proposed merger with Carolina Financial, for which due diligence and negotiations were
substantially complete at the time of Bank B’s indication of interest letter.

· Market overlap and anti-competitive concerns that would be present in a transaction with Bank B that are not present in
the proposed merger with Carolina Financial.

· The tax consequences to First South’s stockholders of a cash transaction such as the one proposed by Bank B.

· The recent strong performance of Carolina Financial’s common stock.

First South’s board also considered potential risks and a variety of potential negative factors in connection with its
deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the merger, including the following material factors (not in any relative order of
importance):
 

· the fact that, while First South expects that the merger will be consummated, there can be no assurance that all conditions
to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger agreement will be satisfied, including the risk that certain regulatory
approvals, the receipt of which are conditions to the consummation of the merger, might not be obtained, and, as a result,
the merger may not be consummated;

· the restrictions on the conduct of First South’s business prior to the completion of the merger, which are customary for
public company merger agreements involving financial institutions, but which, subject to specific exceptions, could delay
or prevent First South from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take
with respect to the operations of First South absent the pending completion of the merger;

· the significant risks and costs involved in connection with entering into or completing the merger, or failing to complete
the merger in a timely manner, or at all, including as a result of any failure to obtain required regulatory approvals or
stockholder approval, such as the risks and costs relating to diversion of management and employee attention from other
strategic opportunities and operational matters, potential employee attrition, and the potential effect on business and
customer relationships;

· the fact that First South would be prohibited from soliciting acquisition proposals after execution of the merger
agreement, and the possibility that the $5,750,000 termination fee payable by First South upon the termination of the
merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing bid to
acquire First South;

· the fact that some of First South’s directors and executive officers have other interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, their interests as First South stockholders, including, but not limited to, the specific terms of the
employment agreements offered to Mr. Elder and Mr. Sullivan; and

· the possibility of litigation in connection with the merger.

Based on the factors described above, the board of First South determined that the merger with Carolina Financial and the
merger of First South Bank with CresCom Bank would be advisable and in the best interests of First South and its stockholders and
other constituencies the board was authorized by the articles of incorporation to consider, and adopted the merger agreement and
resolved to recommend its approval to the stockholders of First South.

 
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by First South’s board is not intended to be exhaustive but

includes the material factors considered by First South’s board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, First South’s board did not find it useful, and did not attempt, to quantify,
rank or otherwise assign relative weights to these factors. In considering the factors described above, the individual members of First
South’s board may have given different weight to different factors. First South’s board conducted an overall analysis of the factors
described above including through discussions with, and questioning of, First South’s management and First South’s legal and financial
advisors, and considered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.
 
Carolina Financial’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Carolina Financial Board of Directors

 
Carolina Financial’s board of directors believes that the completion of the merger presents a unique opportunity for Carolina

Financial to further its strategic plan by expanding its franchise and banking operations in the eastern and central North Carolina
markets, which Carolina Financial believes is an attractive market area in North Carolina, and which is contiguous to its existing
markets in southeastern North Carolina. Carolina Financial’s board of directors also noted that the merger furthered Carolina
Financial’s strategic growth plan, would add a solid core deposit base, diversify its loan portfolio composition, be immediately
accretive to earnings and be a good cultural fit.

The terms of the merger, including the merger consideration, are the result of arm’s-length negotiations between
representatives of Carolina Financial and First South. In reaching its decision to approve the merger, Carolina Financial’s board of
directors consulted with its legal advisors regarding the terms of the transaction and with management of Carolina Financial. In
approving the entry into the merger agreement, Carolina Financial’s board of directors considered the following material factors:

· The merger represents an attractive opportunity to continue to execute on its strategic objective of disciplined, profitable
growth;

· First South represents a scarce market expansion opportunity as one of the few suitable community banks in the attractive
eastern and central North Carolina markets, which have strong demographics complementary and contiguous to Carolina
Financial’s expansion into the southeastern North Carolina market;

· The merger would expand and diversify Carolina Financial’s markets, and further diversify its loan portfolio, revenue and
deposit mix;

· First South is a very well-managed, quality organization with strong historical earnings and a service-focused business
model; 

· First South’s and Carolina Financial’s respective management teams share a common business vision and commitment to
their respective clients, stockholders, employees and other constituencies; 

· The two companies have complementary service-focused business models; 

· Carolina Financial’s management believes that the merger would be immediately accretive to Carolina Financial’s
earnings per share (excluding one-time charges) due to a combination of revenue synergies and cost savings opportunities
for the combined company. Revenue synergies will be derived from Carolina Financial having a greater array of products
and services to offer to the former First South customers, as well as having the ability to provide expanded credit
availability through Carolina Financial’s higher capital resources; and

· The Carolina Financial board’s belief that the merger is likely to provide an increase in stockholder value, including the
benefits of a stronger strategic position. 

In addition, Carolina Financial’s board of directors considered the opinion, dated June 9, 2017, of KBW to the Carolina
Financial board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to Carolina Financial of
the exchange ratio in the proposed merger, as more fully described below under “Opinion of Carolina Financial’s Financial Advisor.”

Carolina Financial’s board of directors also considered potential risks associated with the merger in connection with its
deliberations of the proposed transaction, including the challenges of integrating First South’s business, operations, and workforce with
those of Carolina Financial, the potential negative impact on Carolina Financial’s stock price and the need to obtain stockholder and
regulatory approvals in order to complete the transaction.

Carolina Financial’s board of directors considered all of these factors as a whole and, on balance, Carolina Financial’s board
of directors believes that the opportunities created by the merger to increase the value of Carolina Financial’s franchise more than
offset any integration or other risks inherent in the merger.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Carolina Financial’s board of directors is not
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by Carolina Financial’s board of directors. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered by Carolina Financial’s board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of
these matters, Carolina Financial’s board of directors did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its decision. In considering the factors described above,
individual members of Carolina Financial’s board of directors may have given different weights to different factors.

The Carolina Financial board of directors unanimously adopted the merger agreement, authorized the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and determined that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial common stock to First South
stockholders in connection with the merger, are in the best interests of Carolina Financial and its stockholders. Accordingly, the
Carolina Financial board of directors unanimously recommends that Carolina Financial stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal
to approve the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Carolina Financial common stock
to First South stockholders in connection with the merger, and “FOR” the Carolina Financial adjournment proposal.

Opinion of First South’s Financial Advisor
 
First South retained Raymond James as its financial advisor on November 2, 2016. Pursuant to that engagement, the First

South board of directors requested that Raymond James deliver its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of First South’s outstanding common stock of the exchange ratio to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger
agreement.

 
At the June 9, 2017 meeting of the First South board, representatives of Raymond James delivered its written opinion to the

First South board dated June 9, 2017, as to the fairness, as of such date, from a financial point of view, to the holders of First South’s
outstanding common stock of the exchange ratio to be received by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, based
upon and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and other matters considered in connection with the preparation of its opinion.

 
The full text of the written opinion of Raymond James is attached as Annex C to this document. The summary of the opinion

of Raymond James set forth in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such written opinion. Holders of
First South common stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.

 
Raymond James provided its opinion for the information of the First South board of directors (solely in each director’s

capacity as such) in connection with, and for purposes of, its consideration of the merger and its opinion only addresses whether the
exchange ratio to be received by the holders of First South common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders as of the date of such opinion. The opinion of Raymond James does not address any
other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger contemplated thereby. The Raymond James opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to the First South board or to any holder of First South common stock as to how the First South board, such
stockholder or any other person should vote or otherwise act with respect to the merger or any other matter. Raymond James did not
express any opinion as to the likely trading range of Carolina Financial common stock following the date of the opinion, which may
vary depending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial condition of Carolina Financial at
that time. Raymond James also does not express any opinion as to the trading price of Carolina Financial common stock relative to its
historical or future financial condition or results of operations.

 
In connection with its review of the proposed merger and the preparation of its opinion, Raymond James, among other things:

 
· reviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the merger agreement dated as of June 9, 2017, which

is referred to in this section as the “Draft Agreement”;
 

· reviewed certain information related to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of
First South made available to Raymond James by First South, including, but not limited to, financial projections prepared
by the management of First South relating to First South for the period ending December 31, 2022, as approved for
Raymond James’ use by First South, which are referred to in this section as the “Projections”;

regarding First South and Carolina Financial;

current market prices of the publicly traded securities of certain other companies that Raymond James deemed to be
relevant;
 

· conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors, as
Raymond James deemed appropriate; and
 

· discussed with members of the senior management of First South certain information relating to the aforementioned and
any other matters which Raymond James deemed relevant to its inquiry.

 
With First South’s consent, Raymond James assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information

supplied by or on behalf of First South, or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, and Raymond James did not
undertake any duty or responsibility to, nor did Raymond James, independently verify any of such information. Raymond James did
not make or obtain an independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of First South. Raymond James is not
an expert in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for loan losses;
accordingly, it assumed that such allowances for losses are in the aggregate adequate to cover such losses. With respect to the
Projections and any other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, Raymond
James, with First South’s consent, assumed that the Projections and such other information and data were reasonably prepared in good
faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of First South, and Raymond James relied
upon First South to advise Raymond James promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be
updated during the period of its review. Raymond James expressed no opinion with respect to the Projections or the assumptions on
which they were based. Raymond James relied upon, without independent verification, First South’s assessment of its management and
its legal, tax, accounting and regulatory advisors with respect to all legal, tax, accounting and regulatory matters, including without
limitation that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Raymond James assumed that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the Draft Agreement reviewed
by Raymond James and that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver
of or amendment to any of the conditions thereto and without adjustment to the exchange ratio. Furthermore, Raymond James
assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement
were true and correct and that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the
merger agreement without being waived. Raymond James also relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the
merger would be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable international, federal and state statutes,
rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
merger would be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions would be imposed or amendments, modifications or
waivers made that would have an effect on the merger or First South that would be material to its analysis or opinion.
 

Raymond James expressed no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the merger, the structure or tax
consequences of the merger, or the availability or advisability of any alternatives to the merger. The Raymond James opinion is limited
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of First South common stock.
Raymond James expressed no opinion with respect to any other reasons (legal, business, or otherwise) that may support the decision of
First South’s board of directors to approve or consummate the merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation was intended
by Raymond James on matters that require legal, accounting or tax advice. Raymond James assumed that such opinions, counsel or
interpretations had been or would be obtained from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Raymond James relied, with the
consent of First South, on the fact that First South was assisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors, and, with the consent of First
South relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of the assessments by First South and its advisors, as to all legal,
accounting and tax matters with respect to First South and the merger.

In formulating its opinion, Raymond James considered only the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of First South
common stock, and Raymond James did not consider, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of First South’s officers, directors or employees, or such class of persons, whether relative to
the exchange ratio or otherwise. Raymond James was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or
otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the merger to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of First South, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in the last sentence of its opinion or
(2) the fairness of the merger to any one class or group of First South’s or any other party’s security holders or other constituencies vis-
à-vis any other class or group of First South’s or such other party’s security holders or other constituencies (including, without
limitation, the allocation of any consideration to be received in the merger amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders
or other constituencies). Raymond James expressed no opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of First
South or Carolina Financial or the ability of First South or Carolina Financial to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
 
Material Financial Analyses
 

The following summarizes the material financial analyses reviewed by Raymond James with the First South board of directors

Raymond James calculated various financial multiples for each company, including: price per share at close on June 8, 2017
compared to (i) tangible book value (TBV) per share at March 31, 2017; and (ii) LTM earnings per share (EPS) for the most recent
LTM period reported. All financial multiples—TBV per share and LTM EPS—greater than two standard deviations away from the
unadjusted mean were considered not meaningful. Raymond James reviewed the 75th percentile, mean, median and 25th percentile
relative valuation multiples of the selected public companies. The results of the selected public companies analysis are summarized
below:
 
  Price /
  TBV per Share  LTM EPS
75th Percentile   178%  20.0x
Mean   158%  19.0x
Median   152%  18.2x
25th Percentile   139%  17.9x
         
Implied Transaction Metric   181%  20.4x
 

Furthermore, Raymond James applied the 75th percentile, mean, median and 25th percentile relative valuation multiples for
each of the metrics to First South’s actual financial results and then divided those values by Carolina Financial’s 20-day volume-
weighted average closing price of $30.62 as of June 8, 2017 to derive an implied exchange ratio for shares of First South common
stock. Raymond James then compared those implied exchange ratios to the exchange ratio of 0.5200. The results of this are
summarized below:
 
  Price /
  TBV per Share LTM EPS
75th Percentile   0.5114   0.5083 
Mean   0.4528   0.4842 
Median   0.4357   0.4630 
25th Percentile   0.3992   0.4565 
         
Exchange Ratio   0.5200   0.5200 
 

Selected Transaction Analysis. Raymond James analyzed publicly available information relating to selected transactions
announced since January 1, 2016 involving targets headquartered in the Southeast with (i) total assets between $500 million and $2.0
billion; (ii) LTM ROAA between 0.50% and 1.25%; (iii) tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio between 6.0% and 12.0%; and
(iv) NPAs / Assets less than 3.00%. Raymond James also analyzed publicly available information relating to selected national
transactions announced in the twelve-month period ended June 8, 2017 involving targets headquartered in the United States with (i)
total assets between $500 million and $2.0 billion; (ii) LTM ROAA between 0.50% and 1.25%; (iii) tangible common equity to
tangible assets ratio between 6.0% and 12.0%; and (iv) NPAs / Assets less than 3.00%. Financial data for the selected targets were
based on the most recent twelve month period reported as of June 8, 2017. Both regional and national selected transaction analyses
excluded (i) transactions without publicly disclosed deal value or key financial information; (ii) transactions with cumulative equity
ownership acquired less than 100%; (iii) investor recapitalizations; and (iv) mergers of equals transactions. Profitability metrics,
including LTM ROAA and LTM EPS, for certain target companies structured as Subchapter S corporations were adjusted to assume a
normalized tax rate of 35%. Certain financial and valuation metrics for the target Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. were adjusted
to exclude its $4.3 million valuation allowance reversal recorded in 2016. The selected transactions (with respective transaction
announcement dates shown) used in the analyses included:
 
Regional: 
 
 • Acquisition of Capstone Bancshares, Inc. by SmartFinancial, Inc. (05/22/17)

 • Acquisition of Paragon Commercial Corporation by TowneBank (04/27/17)

 • Acquisition of Metropolitan BancGroup, Inc. by Renasant Corporation (01/17/17)

Raymond James examined valuation multiples of transaction value compared to the target companies’ (i) most recent quarter

tangible book value per share; (ii) most recent LTM EPS; and (iii) core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than
$100,000). All financial multiples—TBV, LTM EPS, and core deposit premiums—greater than two standard deviations away from the
unadjusted mean were considered not meaningful. TBV per share and LTM EPS transaction valuation multiples were shown on a per
share basis where possible, and if per share valuation metrics were unavailable, aggregate pricing multiples were used. Valuation
multiples based on core deposits were based on aggregate transaction values. Raymond James reviewed the 75th percentile, mean,
median and 25th percentile relative valuation multiples of the selected transactions. Furthermore, Raymond James applied the 75th

percentile, mean, median and 25th percentile relative valuation multiples to First South’s actual TBV per share, LTM EPS and core
deposits and divided those values by Carolina Financial’s 20-day volume-weighted average closing price of $30.62 as of June 8, 2017
to determine the implied exchange ratio for shares of First South common stock. Raymond James then compared those implied
exchange ratios to the exchange ratio of 0.5200. The results of the selected transactions analysis are summarized below:
 
Regional:
 
  Deal Value per Share /   
  TBV per Share  Implied Exchange Ratio
75th Percentile   209%  0.5993

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Raymond James analyzed the discounted present value of First South’s projected free cash
flows for the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022 on a stand-alone basis. Raymond James used tangible
common equity in excess of a target ratio of 8.0% at the end of each projection period for free cash flow.

 
The discounted cash flow analysis was based on the Projections. Consistent with the periods included in the Projections,

Raymond James used calendar year 2022 as the final year for the analysis and applied multiples, ranging from 12.0x to 18.0x, to
calendar year 2022 adjusted net income in order to derive a range of terminal values for First South in 2022. Raymond James selected a
range of terminal price-to-earnings multiples based upon the long-term average of the price-to-earnings multiple of selected banking
indexes and current multiples for similar public companies.

 
The projected free cash flows and terminal values were discounted using rates ranging from 11.4% to 13.4%. The resulting

range of equity values was adjusted for options outstanding and divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding in order to arrive
at a range of present values per First South share. The aforementioned present values were divided by Carolina Financial’s 20-day
volume-weighted average closing price of $30.62 as of June 8, 2017 to derive a range of implied exchange ratios. Raymond James
reviewed the range of exchange ratios derived in the discounted cash flow analysis and compared them to the exchange ratio in the
merger. The results of the discounted cash flow analysis are summarized below:
 
   
  Implied Exchange Ratio
Maximum   0.5807 
Minimum   0.3742 
     
Exchange Ratio   0.5200 
 

Additional Considerations. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not susceptible to a partial
analysis or summary description. Raymond James believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions
of its analyses, without considering the analyses taken as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its
opinion. In addition, Raymond James considered the results of all such analyses and did not assign relative weights to any of the
analyses, but rather made qualitative judgments as to significance and relevance of each analysis and factor, so the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be the view of Raymond James as to the actual value of
First South.

 
In performing its analyses, Raymond James made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general

business, economic and regulatory conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of First South. The analyses
performed by Raymond James are not necessarily indicative of actual values, trading values or actual future results which might be
achieved, all of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were provided to the
First South board of directors (solely in each director’s capacity as such) and were prepared solely as part of the analysis of Raymond
James of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of First South common stock of the exchange ratio to be
received by such holders in connection with the proposed merger pursuant to the merger agreement. The analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies may actually be sold, and such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty.
The opinion of Raymond James was one of many factors taken into account by the First South board in making its determination to
approve the merger. Neither Raymond James’ opinion, nor the analyses described above should be viewed as determinative of the First
South board’s or First South management’s views with respect to First South, Carolina Financial, or the merger. Raymond James
provided advice to the First South board of directors with respect to the proposed transaction. Raymond James did not, however,
determine the amount of consideration, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the First South board or recommend that
any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. First South placed no limits on the scope of the
analysis performed, or opinion expressed, by Raymond James.

The Raymond James opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions
existing and disclosed to it as of June 8, 2017, and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may require a
reevaluation of the opinion of Raymond James, but Raymond James does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion. Raymond James relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there had been no change in the business,
assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of First South since the respective dates of the most
recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to Raymond James that would be material to its
analyses or its opinion, and that there was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Raymond
James incomplete or misleading in any material respect.

 
During the two years preceding the date of Raymond James’ written opinion, Raymond James has been engaged by or

otherwise performed services for First South for which it was paid a fee (separately from any amounts that were paid to Raymond
James under the engagement letter described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus pursuant to which Raymond James was retained
as a financial advisor to First South to assist in reviewing strategic alternatives).

 
First South paid Raymond James a retainer of $25,000 upon execution of the engagement letter. For services rendered in

connection with the delivery of its opinion, First South paid Raymond James, upon delivery of the opinion, a customary investment
banking fee of $250,000. First South will also pay Raymond James a customary fee for advisory services in connection with the merger
of 1.20% of the implied value of the merger (less the fee paid upon delivery of the opinion, the amount of which shall be deducted), all
of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger. First South agreed to reimburse Raymond James up to $15,000 for its expenses
incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and expenses of its counsel, and will indemnify Raymond James against
certain liabilities arising out of its engagement. In the event that, subject to certain conditions, First South is the target of a hostile
takeover, First South has agreed to pay Raymond James an additional retainer of $50,000, with additional amounts due during the
pendency of the term of the engagement letter, plus additional reimbursement of legal fees of up to $25,000. In addition, Raymond
James will be entitled to 25.0% of any break-up or termination fee received by First South in connection with a termination of the
merger agreement (up to the amount that Raymond James would have received had the merger been closed).
 

Raymond James is actively involved in the investment banking business and regularly undertakes the valuation of investment
securities in connection with public offerings, private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. In the ordinary
course of business, Raymond James may trade in the securities of First South and Carolina Financial for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Raymond James has
provided certain services to Carolina Financial (in the previous two years), including serving as bookrunning manager for its 2015 and
2017 public offerings of common equity, for which it has been paid fees in the aggregate amount of $2.6 million. In addition, Raymond
James served as financial advisor to Greer Bancshares Incorporated in connection with its acquisition by Carolina Financial, for which
Raymond James received fees of $0.8 million. Furthermore, Raymond James may provide investment banking, financial advisory and
other financial services to First South and/or Carolina Financial or other participants in the merger in the future, for which Raymond
James may receive compensation.

Opinion of Carolina Financial’s Financial Advisor
 
Carolina Financial engaged KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Carolina Financial,

including an opinion to the Carolina Financial board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Carolina Financial
of the exchange ratio in the proposed merger. Carolina Financial selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment
banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is
continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the Carolina Financial board held on June 9, 2017
at which the Carolina Financial board evaluated the proposed merger. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the
proposed merger and rendered an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the exchange
ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Carolina Financial. The Carolina Financial board approved the
merger agreement at this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is
attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to,
the Carolina Financial board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger.
The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the merger to Carolina
Financial. It did not address the underlying business decision of Carolina Financial to engage in the merger or enter into the
merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Carolina Financial board in connection with the merger, and it does
not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Carolina Financial common stock or any stockholder of any other entity as to
how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not
any such stockholder should enter into a voting, stockholders’, affiliates’ or other agreement with respect to the merger or
exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such stockholder.

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and
procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of Carolina Financial and First South and bearing upon the merger, including, among other things:

· a draft of the merger agreement, dated June 8, 2017 (the most recent draft then made available to KBW);
· the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31,

2016 of Carolina Financial;
· the unaudited quarterly financial statements and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March

31, 2017 of Carolina Financial;
· the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31,

2016 of First South;
· the unaudited quarterly financial statements and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March

31, 2017 of First South;
· certain regulatory filings of Carolina Financial and First South and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly

reports on Form FRY-9C and quarterly call reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended
December 31, 2016 and the quarter ended March 31, 2017;

· certain other interim reports and other communications of Carolina Financial and First South to their respective

stockholders; and
· other financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Carolina Financial and First South that

was furnished to KBW by Carolina Financial and First South or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes
of its analysis.

 
KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant

to its analyses included, among others, the following:

· the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Carolina Financial and First South;
· the assets and liabilities of Carolina Financial and First South;
· the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;
· a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Carolina Financial and First South with similar

information for certain other companies, the securities of which were publicly traded;
· financial and operating forecasts and projections of First South with respect to the 2017 fiscal year that were prepared by,

and provided to KBW and discussed with KBW by, First South management and that were used and relied upon by KBW
based on such discussions, at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Carolina Financial board;

· financial and operating forecasts and projections of First South with respect to the period from the 2018 fiscal year
through the 2020 fiscal year that were prepared by Carolina Financial management, as well as assumed First South long-
term growth rates with respect to periods thereafter, all of which information was provided to KBW and discussed with
KBW by Carolina Financial management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and
with the consent of the Carolina Financial board;

· publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Carolina Financial, as well as assumed Carolina Financial long term
growth rates provided to KBW by Carolina Financial management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by
such management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and with the consent of the
Carolina Financial board; and

· estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on Carolina Financial (including without limitation
the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger) that were prepared by Carolina
Financial management, provided to and discussed with KBW by such management, and used and relied upon by KBW at
the direction of such management and with the consent of the Carolina Financial board.
 

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of
general economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well as its experience in securities
valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions that were held by the managements
of Carolina Financial and First South regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and
future prospects of their respective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial and other information provided to it or that was publicly available and KBW did not independently verify the accuracy or
completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW
relied upon the management of First South, with the consent of Carolina Financial, as to the reasonableness and achievability of the
financial and operating forecasts and projections of First South with respect to the 2017 fiscal year referred to above (and the
assumptions and bases therefor), and KBW assumed that such forecasts and projections were reasonably prepared and represented the
best currently available estimates and judgments of First South management with respect to such fiscal year and that such forecasts and
projections would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated by such management. In addition, KBW relied upon the
management of Carolina Financial as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating forecasts and projections of
First South with respect to the period from the 2018 fiscal year through the 2020 fiscal year, as well as assumed First South long-term
growth rates with respect to periods thereafter, all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information) and
KBW assumed that all such information was reasonably prepared and represented the best currently available estimates and judgments
of Carolina Financial management and that the forecasts, projections and estimates contained in such information would be realized in
the amounts and in the time periods estimated by such management. KBW further relied upon the management of Carolina Financial as
to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Carolina Financial, the assumed
Carolina Financial long-term growth rates and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on Carolina
Financial (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger)
referred to above and the assumptions set forth in and the bases for such information. KBW assumed, at the direction of Carolina
Financial, that all such information was reasonably prepared and represented, or in the case of the publicly available consensus “street
estimates” of Carolina Financial referred to above that such estimates were consistent with, the best currently available estimates and

judgments of Carolina Financial management, and that the forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information would be
realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

It is understood that the forecasts, projections and estimates of Carolina Financial and First South that were provided to and
discussed with KBW were not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all such forecasts, projections and estimates,
together with the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Carolina Financial referred to above, were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and
competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW
assumed, based on discussions with the respective managements of Carolina Financial and First South and with the consent of the
Carolina Financial board, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW could form its opinion and KBW
expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all such information without
independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness
thereof.

KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of either Carolina Financial or First South since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that
were made available to KBW and that KBW was directed to use. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy
of allowances for loan and lease losses and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with Carolina Financial’s consent,
that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for each of Carolina Financial and First South are adequate to cover such losses.
In rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Carolina Financial or First South, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the
collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial
capability or fair value of Carolina Financial or First South under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices
at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, KBW assumed no
responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:

· the merger and any related transactions (including the subsidiary bank merger) would be completed substantially in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in
any respect material to its analyses from the draft version of the merger agreement that had been reviewed by KBW and
referred to above) with no adjustments to the exchange ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of
First South common stock;

· the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments
referred to in the merger agreement were true and correct;

· each party to the merger agreement or any of the related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by such party under such documents;

· that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental
approval for the merger or any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger) and that all conditions to the
completion of the merger and any such related transaction would be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the
merger agreement or any of the related documents; and

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 87/222

 

 
· in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the merger and any

related transactions (including the subsidiary bank merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements,
termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a material adverse
effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Carolina Financial, First South, the pro forma entity or
the contemplated benefits of the merger, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the merger.
 

KBW assumed that the merger would be consummated in a manner that complied with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. KBW was further advised by
representatives of Carolina Financial that Carolina Financial relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other
appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Carolina Financial, First
South, the merger and any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), and the merger agreement. KBW did not provide
advice with respect to any such matters.

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, of the exchange
ratio in the merger to Carolina Financial. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the merger or any term
or aspect of any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the
merger or any such related transaction, any consequences of the merger to Carolina Financial, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise,
or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, retention, consulting, voting, support, cooperation, stockholder or
other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the merger, any such related
transaction, or otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of
such opinion and the information made available to KBW through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW’s opinion
may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. For purposes of its analyses, KBW did not incorporate recently-announced proposed changes to
United States tax laws regarding corporate tax rates. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with
respect to:

· the underlying business decision of Carolina Financial to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement;
· the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or

contemplated by Carolina Financial or the Carolina Financial board;
· any business, operational or other plans with respect to First South or the pro forma entity that may be currently

contemplated by Carolina Financial or the Carolina Financial board or that may be implemented subsequent to the closing
of the merger;

· the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Carolina Financial’s officers, directors or employees,
or any class of such persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Carolina Financial common stock or relative
to the exchange ratio;

· the effect of the merger or any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger) on, or the fairness of the
consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of Carolina Financial, First South or any other party to
any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement;

· any adjustment (as provided in the merger agreement) to the exchange ratio assumed for purposes of KBW’s opinion;
· the actual value of Carolina Financial common stock to be issued in connection with the merger;
· the prices, trading range or volume at which Carolina Financial common stock or First South common stock would trade

following the public announcement of the merger or the prices, trading range or volume at which Carolina Financial
common stock would trade following the consummation of the merger;

· any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the merger or any other transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement; or

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 88/222

 

 
· any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Carolina Financial, First South, any of their respective

stockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the merger or any other related transaction (including
the subsidiary bank merger), including whether or not the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United
States federal income tax purposes.
 

In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, Carolina Financial and First
South. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses
or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold.
Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among
several factors taken into consideration by the Carolina Financial board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement
and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Carolina
Financial board with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were
determined through negotiation between Carolina Financial and First South and the decision of Carolina Financial to enter into the
merger agreement was solely that of the Carolina Financial board.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the Carolina Financial board in
connection with its opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the
presentation made by KBW to the Carolina Financial board, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in
connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic
process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its
analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the proposed merger of
$155.8 million, or $16.28 per outstanding share of First South common stock, based on the 0.52x exchange ratio in the proposed
merger and the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock on June 8, 2017. In addition to the financial analyses described
below, KBW reviewed with the Carolina Financial board for informational purposes, among other things, implied transaction multiples
for the proposed merger, based on the implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $16.28 per outstanding share of First South
common stock, of 19.9x First South’s estimated 2017 earnings per share (“EPS”) and 18.4x First South’s estimated 2018 EPS using
estimates for First South provided by First South management for 2017 and Carolina Financial management for 2018.

Carolina Financial Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial
performance, financial condition and market performance of Carolina Financial to 11 selected banks that were listed on NASDAQ, the
New York Stock Exchange or NYSE MKT and headquartered in the Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee with total assets between $1.5 billion and $5.0 billion and Nonperforming Assets /
Loans + OREO less than 2.0%. Merger targets were excluded from the selected companies.

Bear State Financial, Inc.  Live Oak Bancshares, Inc.
FB Financial Corporation  National Commerce Corporation
First Bancorp  Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida
First Bancshares, Inc.  State Bank Financial Corporation
Franklin Financial Network, Inc.   

 
To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability data and other financial information as of, or for the most recent available

completed fiscal quarter (“MRQ”) or latest 12 months (“LTM”) period ended, March 31, 2017 and market price information as of June
8, 2017. KBW also used 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for Carolina Financial and, to the
extent available, the selected companies. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, as referenced in the tables presented below, may not
correspond to the data presented in Carolina Financial’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared by Raymond James
presented under the section “The Merger — Opinion of First South’s Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different periods,
assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the financial performance of Carolina Financial and the selected
companies:

In addition, KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the market performance of Carolina Financial and, to the extent
available, the selected companies:

    Selected Companies

(1) Consensus “street estimates” were not available for one of the selected companies.
(2) Dividend yield and MRQ dividend payout ratio reflected most recent quarterly dividend annualized as a percentage of stock

price and annualized MRQ EPS, respectively. Five of the selected companies did not pay dividends in its most recent
completed quarter.

 
No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Carolina Financial. Accordingly, an

analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

First South Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance,
financial condition and market performance of First South to 13 selected banks that were listed on NASDAQ, the New York Stock
Exchange or NYSE MKT and headquartered in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia with total assets between $750 million and $1.5 billion and NPAs / Loans + OREO less than
2.0%. Merger targets and institutions involved in a pending merger of equals were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:

Auburn National Bancorporation, Inc.  National Bankshares, Inc.
C&F Financial Corporation  Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc.
CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc.  Select Bancorp, Inc.
Charter Financial Corporation  SmartFinancial, Inc.
Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.  Southern First Bancshares, Inc.
Community Bankers Trust Corporation  Sunshine Bancorp, Inc.
First Community Corporation   

 
To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability data and other financial information as of, or for the most recent available

completed fiscal quarter or latest 12 months period ended, March 31, 2017 and market price information as of June 8, 2017. KBW also
used 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for the selected companies (to the extent available) and
estimates for First South provided by First South management for 2017 and Carolina Financial management for 2018. Where
consolidated holding company level financial data for Sunshine Bancorp, Inc. was unreported, subsidiary bank level data was utilized
to calculate ratios. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data
presented in First South’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared Raymond James presented under the section “The Merger
— Opinion of First South’s Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute
the financial data presented.

In addition, KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the market performance of First South and, to the extent

available, the selected companies (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiple for one of the selected companies, which multiple
was considered to be not meaningful because it was negative):

Selected Transactions Analysis. KBW reviewed publicly available information related to 25 selected U.S. bank and thrift
transactions announced since January 1, 2016 with deal values between $100 million and $300 million. Merger-of-equals transactions
were excluded from the selected transactions. The selected transactions were as follows:

Acquiror  Acquired Company
Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.  Commerce Bancshares Corp.
First Bancorp  ASB Bancorp, Inc.
First Busey Corporation  Mid Illinois Bancorp, Inc.
First Merchants Corporation  Independent Alliance Banks, Inc.
Heartland Financial USA, Inc.  Citywide Banks of Colorado, Inc.

First Busey Corporation  First Community Financial Partners, Inc.
Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation  Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc.
Midland States Bancorp, Inc.  Centrue Financial Corporation
Renasant Corporation  Metropolitan BancGroup, Inc.
Veritex Holdings, Inc.  Sovereign Bancshares, Inc.
CenterState Banks, Inc.  Gateway Financial Holdings of Florida, Inc.
Enterprise Financial Services Corp  Jefferson County Bancshares, Inc.
First Commonwealth Financial Corporation  DCB Financial Corp
OceanFirst Financial Corp.  Ocean Shore Holding Co.
Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.  First Choice Bank

Bar Harbor Bankshares  Lake Sunapee Bank Group
WesBanco, Inc.  Your Community Bankshares, Inc.
Westfield Financial, Inc.  Chicopee Bancorp, Inc.

Midland Financial Co.  1st Century Bancshares, Inc.
Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc.  Xenith Bankshares, Inc.
Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.  Avenue Financial Holdings, Inc.
OceanFirst Financial Corp.  Cape Bancorp, Inc.

 
For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction

consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company’s then latest publicly
available financial statements prior to the announcement of the acquisition:

· Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions
involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided
by total tangible common equity);

· Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired
company, referred to as core deposit premium; and

· Price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private
acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM net income)

The above transaction statistics for the selected transactions were compared with the corresponding transaction statistics for
the proposed merger based on the implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $155.8 million and using historical financial
information for First South as of or for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017.

The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiples for three of the

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to First South or the

proposed merger. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Relative Contribution Analysis. KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Carolina Financial and First South to
various pro forma balance sheet and income statement items and the pro forma market capitalization of the combined entity. This
analysis did not include purchase accounting adjustments or cost savings. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) historical balance
sheet data for Carolina Financial and First South as of March 31, 2017, (ii) historical earnings data for Carolina Financial and First
South for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, (iii) publicly available EPS consensus “street estimates” of Carolina Financial for 2017
and 2018 and earnings estimates for First South provided by First South management for 2017 and Carolina Financial management for
2018, and (iv) market price data as of June 8, 2017. The results of KBW’s analysis are set forth in the following table, which also
compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of Carolina Financial and First South
shareholders in the combined company based on the 0.52x exchange ratio in the proposed merger:

Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis. KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected

income statement and balance sheet information of Carolina Financial and First South. Using closing balance sheet estimates as of
December 31, 2017 for Carolina Financial and First South provided by Carolina Financial management, EPS estimates for First South
provided by First South management for 2017 and Carolina Financial management for 2018, publicly available EPS consensus “street
estimates” of Carolina Financial for 2017 and 2018, and pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, the cost savings and
related expenses expected to result from the merger and certain accounting adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect
thereto) provided by Carolina Financial management, KBW analyzed the estimated financial impact of the merger on certain projected
financial results. This analysis indicated that the merger could be accretive to Carolina Financial’s 2018 estimated EPS and dilutive to
Carolina Financial’s estimated tangible book value per share at closing. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, pro forma for the
merger, each of Carolina Financial’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio, Tier
1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio at closing could be lower. For all of the above analysis, the actual
results achieved by Carolina Financial following the merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range for the implied equity
value of First South, taking into account the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the merger as well as certain
accounting adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto. In this analysis, KBW used financial forecasts and
projections relating to the earnings and assets of First South with respect to the period from 2018 to 2020 provided by Carolina
Financial management, assumed First South long term growth rates provided by Carolina Financial management and estimated cost
savings and related expenses and accounting adjustments and restructuring charges provided by Carolina Financial management, and
KBW assumed discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0%. The ranges of values were derived by adding (i) the present value of the
estimated excess cash flows that First South could generate over the five-year period from 2018 to 2022 and (ii) the present value of
First South’s implied terminal value at the end of such period, in each case applying estimated cost savings and related expenses and
accounting adjustments and restructuring charges. KBW assumed that First South would maintain a tangible common equity to
tangible assets ratio of 8.00% and First South would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In calculating the terminal value
of First South, KBW applied a range of 13.0x to 17.0x First South’s estimated 2023 earnings. This discounted cash flow analysis
resulted in a range of implied values per share of First South common stock, taking into account the cost savings and related expenses
expected to result from the merger as well as certain accounting adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto, of
$17.74 per share to $26.67 per share.

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly
dependent on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates, and
discount rates. The above analyses did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of First South.

Miscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to Carolina Financial in connection with the proposed merger and did not act
as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation
of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking
companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of its and their
broker-dealer businesses, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Carolina
Financial and First South. In addition, as a market maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or
short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Carolina Financial or First South for its and their own respective accounts
and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and clients.

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, Carolina Financial has agreed to pay KBW a total cash fee equal to $900,000,
$100,000 of which became payable with the rendering of KBW’s opinion and the balance of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the merger. Carolina Financial also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
disbursements incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of
KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in connection therewith. In addition to this present engagement, in the two years preceding the date
of KBW’s opinion, KBW provided investment banking and financial advisory services to Carolina Financial for which compensation
was received. KBW acted as financial advisor to Carolina Financial in connection with its March 2017 acquisition of Greer Bancshares
Incorporated. In addition, KBW acted as an underwriter in connection with each of Carolina Financial’s January 2017 and December
2015 registered offerings of Carolina Financial common stock. In the two years preceding the date of KBW’s opinion, KBW did not
provide investment banking and financial advisory services to First South. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and
financial advisory services to Carolina Financial or First South and receive compensation for such services.

Certain Carolina Financial and First South Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
 

Carolina Financial and First South do not as a matter of course publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future
performance, revenues, earnings, financial condition or other results due to, among other reasons, the inherent uncertainty of the
underlying assumptions and estimates and the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods. In
connection with the proposed transaction, however, (1) First South management prepared certain projections of First South’s future
financial performance, which contain unaudited prospective financial information with respect to First South on a standalone, pre-
merger basis, and which were made available, in part, to each of the potential merger partners that signed a non-disclosure agreement
with First South, including Carolina Financial, First South’s Board of Directors and First South’s financial advisor, Raymond James,
and (2) Carolina Financial management provided to KBW and Raymond James certain assumptions relating to certain unaudited
prospective pro forma financial information. Carolina Financial and First South have included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
limited unaudited financial information for Carolina Financial and First South to give First South stockholders access to certain
nonpublic prospective financial information provided to the First South board of directors for purposes of considering and evaluating
the merger and to Raymond James and KBW for purposes of performing financial analyses in connection with their respective
opinions to the First South Board of Directors and the Carolina Financial Board of Directors, which we refer to in this section as the
“Prospective Financial Information.”

 
The Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and the inclusion of the

Prospective Financial Information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that Carolina
Financial, First South or any other recipient of the Prospective Financial Information considered, or now considers, them to be
necessarily predictive of actual future results. None of Carolina Financial, First South, or their respective affiliates assume any
responsibility for the accuracy of the Prospective Financial Information. The Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with
a view toward complying with the guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board for preparation or presentation of financial information, or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. None
of Carolina Financial’s current independent registered public accounting firm, Elliott Davis Decosimo, PLLC, First South’s current
independent registered public accounting firm, Cherry Bekaert LLP, First South’s former independent registered public accounting
firm, Turlington and Company, L.L.P., or any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures
with respect to the projections or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The
reports of Elliott Davis Decosimo, PLLC, Cherry Bekaert LLP, and Turlington and Company, L.L.P. that are incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus related only to Carolina Financial’s and First South’s historical financial information,
respectively. They do not extend to any prospective financial information.

 
The Prospective Financial Information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made by Carolina Financial and First South

with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events,
as well as matters specific to Carolina Financial’s and First South’s businesses, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which
are beyond Carolina Financial’s or First South’s control. The Prospective Financial Information also reflects assumptions as to certain
business decisions that are subject to change. The Prospective Financial Information reflects subjective judgment in many respects and
thus are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. As such,
the Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking information and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted in such prospective information, including, but not limited to, Carolina
Financial’s performance, First South’s performance, the performance of the combined entity following the merger, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws,
regulations or rules, interest rates, the regulatory environment, and the various risks set forth in Carolina Financial’s and First South’s
reports filed with the SEC. None of First South, Carolina Financial, their respective financial advisors, or any of their respective
affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, accuracy or completeness of the Prospective Financial Information set forth below.
The Prospective Financial Information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared,
including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Further, the Prospective Financial Information does not take into
account the effect of any failure of the merger to occur. None of Carolina Financial, First South, any of their respective financial
advisors, or any of their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update, revise or correct such
Prospective Financial Information if they are or become inaccurate (even in the short term). The inclusion of the Prospective Financial
Information herein should not be deemed an admission or representation Carolina Financial or First South that it is viewed by Carolina
Financial or First South as material information of either Carolina Financial or First South, particularly in light of the inherent risks and
uncertainties associated with such forward-looking information.

Interests of Executive Officers, Employees, and Directors of First South in the Merger
 

General. Some of the executive officers, employees and directors of First South may be deemed to have interests in the
merger in addition to their interests as stockholders of First South generally. These interests include, among others, change in control
payments under the executive officer’s employment or other agreements with First South; proposed employee benefits for those who
become employees of Carolina Financial or a Carolina Financial subsidiary after the merger; entry into retention bonus agreements
with First South and Carolina Financial; the appointment of certain First South directors to the Carolina Financial board, the CresCom
Bank board, and the Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board of CresCom Bank; lump sum payments in exchange for the cancellation
of outstanding First South stock options; and insurance coverage and indemnification for First South’s directors and officers, as
described below.
 

Board Seats. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Carolina Financial has agreed to appoint two representatives of First
South’s board of directors to the board of Carolina Financial. During 2016, non-employee directors of Carolina Financial received a
retainer fee of $8,000 paid in cash and 618 shares of Carolina Financial’s common stock. Those directors not employed by a subsidiary
of Carolina Financial also received $500 for each committee meeting attended.

 
Prior to the effective time of the bank merger, CresCom Bank has agreed to appoint Bruce W. Elder as a director of CresCom

Bank. It is not anticipated that Mr. Elder will be paid in connection with his service as a director of CresCom Bank.
 
It is anticipated that the directors of First South Bank in office immediately prior to the effective time of the bank merger,

other than Mr. Elder, will serve as CresCom Bank’s Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board and will be entitled to receive a fee of
$500 for each advisory board meeting attended. The CresCom Bank Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board is expected to meet no
less than three times per year.

 
Officer Positions. Carolina Financial will appoint the following officers of First South to officer positions with CresCom

Bank, effective upon consummation of the merger, as set forth below:
 
· Bruce W. Elder, President and Chief Executive Officer of First South and First South Bank, will be appointed President of

North Carolina Banking of CresCom Bank.
 

· Cornelius F. Sullivan III, Senior Vice President and Area Executive for Raleigh, Durham, and Wilmington of First South
Bank, will be appointed Senior Vice President and Raleigh Area Executive of CresCom Bank.

 
Employment Agreements for First South Officers. In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Carolina Financial

has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Elder and Sullivan that will be effective upon consummation of the merger, as
summarized below.

 
Employment Agreement with Mr. Elder. CresCom Bank has entered into an employment agreement, dated June 9, 2017, with

Mr. Elder to serve as President of North Carolina Banking of CresCom Bank. The term of Mr. Elder’s employment will begin upon the
closing of the merger and continue for two years thereafter, unless otherwise terminated as provided in the agreement. On the first
anniversary of the merger closing, and at each anniversary date thereafter, the agreement will automatically renew for an additional
year unless either party provides notice of nonrenewal at least thirty days prior to the anniversary date.
 

During the employment period, Mr. Elder will receive an annual base salary of $270,000. During this period, he will also be
entitled to receive annual cash incentive payments and stock awards in such amounts and at such times as may be determined by
CresCom Bank pursuant to its incentive plans and programs.

 
Within 30 days after the merger closing, Carolina Financial will issue to Mr. Elder shares of restricted common stock of

Carolina Financial with a market value of $500,000 as of the grant date. The restricted shares will vest in five equal annual increments
beginning on the first anniversary of the closing of the merger, provided that Mr. Elder has not been terminated for cause, as defined in
the employment agreement, by CresCom Bank on such anniversary date.

 
During the employment period, Mr. Elder will have access to CresCom Bank’s health-and-accident plans and medical

coverage benefits on the same basis as other similarly situated senior executives and key management employees of CresCom Bank.
He will also be entitled to participate in all incentive, bonus, retirement, supplemental retirement, pension, profit-sharing, and other
employee benefits plans and programs of CresCom Bank. CresCom Bank will pay or reimburse Mr. Elder for reasonable expenses
incurred by him in the performance of his duties pursuant to the employment agreement.

If Mr. Elder dies while employed by CresCom Bank, CresCom Bank will pay his estate, legal representatives, or named
beneficiaries all benefits for which he is eligible under his salary continuation agreement (which will be assumed by CresCom Bank)
and any retirement plan of CresCom Bank, if any, to which Mr. Elder is party or in which he participated immediately prior to his
death.

 
If Mr. Elder becomes disabled while employed by CresCom Bank, CresCom Bank must provide him with written notice of its

intention to terminate his employment, in which event his employment would terminate on the thirtieth day after receipt of such notice.
If Mr. Elder’s employment is terminated due to disability, he will receive his base salary through the date of his termination, all benefits
for which he is eligible under his salary continuation agreement, and any applicable long-term disability plan maintained by CresCom
Bank. Mr. Elder will be considered “disabled” if he is entitled to receive long-term disability benefits under CresCom Bank’s long-term
disability plan, or, if there is no such plan, if he would qualify for disability benefits under the federal social security system.
 

If Mr. Elder voluntarily resigns from his employment, then he will have no right to render services or to receive compensation
or other benefits following such termination other than benefits for which he is eligible under his salary continuation agreement. Mr.
Elder must provide CresCom Bank with written notice of his intention to terminate his employment, in which event his employment
would terminate on the thirtieth day after receipt by CresCom Bank of such notice.

 
CresCom Bank may terminate Mr. Elder’s employment at any time for “cause.” If Mr. Elder’s employment is terminated for

cause, he will have no right to render services or to receive compensation or other benefits from CresCom Bank following termination
other than benefits for which he is eligible under the salary continuation agreement. The following constitute “cause” for termination:
 

(1) personal dishonesty, incompetence, or willful misconduct by Mr. Elder;
 

(2) any breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit or intentional failure by Mr. Elder to perform his duties as stated in
the employment agreement;
 

(3) Mr. Elder’s willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations, regulations that do not adversely
affect CresCom Bank or its employees, or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order; or
 

(4) breach of a material term of the employment agreement.
 

In the event of a change in control or if CresCom Bank terminates Mr. Elder’s employment without cause before the end of
the employment period, Mr. Elder will receive the benefits described below if he signs a release and waiver of claims in favor of
CresCom Bank:
 

(1) All base salary through the date of termination.
 

(2) A lump sum cash payment equal to two times Mr. Elder’s base salary at the rate in effect on his date of termination.
 

(3) All benefits for which Mr. Elder is eligible under his salary continuation agreement and any retirement plan of CresCom
Bank, if any, to which he is party or in which he participated immediately prior to his termination.

 
Mr. Elder will be subject to a covenant not to compete and a covenant not to solicit customers or employees of CresCom

Bank. These restrictions apply during the employment period and for a period of two years following the term of the employment
agreement except when termination of Mr. Elder’s employment agreement is due to CresCom Bank’s nonrenewal of the employment
agreement.

Employment Agreement with Mr. Sullivan. CresCom Bank has entered into an employment agreement, dated June 9, 2017,
with Mr. Sullivan to serve as Senior Vice President and Raleigh Area Executive of CresCom Bank. The term of Mr. Sullivan’s
employment will begin upon the closing of the merger and continue for two years thereafter, unless otherwise terminated as provided in
the agreement. On the first anniversary of the merger closing, and at each anniversary date thereafter, the agreement will automatically
renew for an additional year unless either party provides notice of nonrenewal at least thirty days prior to the anniversary date.
 

During the employment period, Mr. Sullivan will receive an annual base salary of $190,000. During this period, he will also
be entitled to receive annual cash incentive payments and stock awards in such amounts and at such times as may be determined by
CresCom Bank pursuant to its incentive plans and programs.

 
Within 30 days after the merger closing, Carolina Financial will issue to Mr. Sullivan shares of restricted common stock of

Carolina Financial with a market value of $100,000 as of the grant date. The restricted shares will vest in four equal annual increments
beginning on the first anniversary of the closing of the merger, provided that Mr. Sullivan has not been terminated for cause, as defined
in the employment agreement, by CresCom Bank on such anniversary date.

 
During the employment period, Mr. Sullivan will have access to CresCom Bank’s health-and-accident plans and medical

coverage benefits on the same basis as other similarly situated senior executives and key management employees of CresCom Bank.
He will also be entitled to participate in all incentive, bonus, retirement, supplemental retirement, pension, profit-sharing, and other
employee benefits plans and programs of CresCom Bank. CresCom Bank will pay or reimburse Mr. Sullivan for reasonable expenses
incurred by him in the performance of his duties pursuant to the employment agreement.
 

The provisions of Mr. Sullivan’s employment agreement with respect to termination as a consequence of death, disability or
voluntary resignation, change in control and termination for cause are substantially the same as those included Mr. Elder’s employment
agreement with CresCom Bank described above. In the event of a change in control or if Mr. Sullivan’s employment is terminated by
CresCom Bank without cause, Mr. Sullivan will receive the same benefits as Mr. Elder, except Mr. Sullivan is not a party to a salary
continuation agreement.

 
 Mr. Sullivan will be subject to a covenant not to compete and a covenant not to solicit customers or employees of CresCom

Bank. These restrictions apply during the employment period and for a period of two years following the term of the employment
agreement. In the event Mr. Sullivan’s employment agreement is terminated due to his nonrenewal, then the non-competition
restrictions apply only during the term of the agreement. If Mr. Sullivan voluntarily resigns from his employment after the third
anniversary date of his employment agreement, then the non-competition restrictions apply for one year following the date of
termination.
 

Retention Bonus Agreements. First South intends to enter into retention bonus agreements with certain non-executive
employees of First South. The total of all payments under such agreements is estimated to aggregate $372,000 in cash and 19,300
shares of Carolina Financial common stock.
 

Employee Benefits. The merger agreement generally provides that Carolina Financial will furnish to those employees of First
South who become employees of CresCom Bank or one of its subsidiaries after the effective time of the merger benefits on the same
basis as it provides coverage to other Carolina Financial or CresCom Bank employees, and Carolina Financial will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or other limitation or exclusion otherwise applicable
under such plans to new employees not to apply to a continuing employee or his or her covered dependents who were covered under a
similar First South plan at the effective time of the merger. For purposes of eligibility and vesting under Carolina Financial’s employee
benefit plans, service with First South prior to the effective time of the merger will be treated as service with Carolina Financial or its
subsidiaries. Carolina Financial will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any successor Carolina Financial employee benefit
plan providing health coverage to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-pocket maximum
applied under such successor plan for any deductible, co-payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by a First South
employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding First South benefit plan during the plan year prior to the transition
effective date.

Insurance and Indemnification. Carolina Financial has agreed to provide directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage for
directors and officers of First South and First South Bank, by purchasing or directing First South to purchase, at Carolina Financial’s
election, continuation coverage under First South’s current policy for directors and officers for a period of not less than six years after
the effective time of the merger. Carolina Financial has also agreed to indemnify the present and former directors, officers, and
employees of First South and First South Bank against all liabilities and damages for all acts or omissions arising out of service for
First South or, at First South’s request, for another entity, occurring at or prior to the merger to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware corporate law, Virginia corporate law, Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the federal securities laws and FDIC
Regulations Part 359, the rules and regulations of any other regulatory authority, and by First South’s articles of incorporation and
bylaws.

 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 or otherwise may be permitted to directors,

officers, and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Carolina Financial has been informed that in the opinion of the
SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.
 

Stock Options. First South has granted certain employees, officers and directors options to purchase First South common
stock under its equity compensation plans. Pursuant to these plans, all stock options outstanding at the time of a corporate transaction
such as the merger will vest and become fully exercisable upon the effective date of such corporate transaction.
 

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, First South has agreed to offer each of the current holders of its stock
options the opportunity to cancel, effective upon and subject to the merger, all of their respective stock options covering shares of First
South’s common stock having an exercise price per share less than the per share value of the merger consideration in exchange for a
cash payment equal to the per share value of the merger consideration minus the exercise price for each share of First South’s common
stock subject to such stock option. Any stock option not cashed out will convert into an option to acquire shares of Carolina Financial
common stock, as adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.
 

Restricted Stock Awards. First South has granted certain employees, officers and directors restricted stock awards under its
2008 Equity Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, all unvested restricted stock awards outstanding at the time of
a corporate transaction such as the merger will vest upon the effective date of such corporate transaction.

 
Golden Parachute Compensation for First South Named Executive Officers
 

Potential Payments and Benefits to First South Named Executive Officers. The following table sets forth the information
required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC regarding certain compensation that First South’s named executive
officers are entitled to receive that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden
parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules. This merger-related compensation is the subject of a non-binding
advisory vote of First South stockholders, as described under “The First South Proposals – First South Proposal 2 – First South Merger-
Related Compensation Proposal” beginning on page 31.

 
The amounts set forth below have been calculated assuming the merger was consummated on September 30, 2017 and, where

applicable, assuming each named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of employment as of September 30, 2017. The
amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers and the estimates are based
on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

(1) Mr. Elder is party to an Employment Agreement with First South. Prior to the closing of the merger, First South intends to
cancel Mr. Elder’s Employment Agreement. (As described above, Mr. Elder’s new Employment Agreement with CresCom
Bank will become effective upon the closing of the merger.) The amount shown in the table represents a lump sum cash
payment that will be paid to Mr. Elder in exchange for the cancellation of his Employment Agreement with First South.
 

(2) For each executive, represents (1) a cash payment equal to the per share value of the merger consideration minus the exercise
price for each share of First South common stock subject to stock options held by the executive and (2) single-trigger
acceleration of outstanding restricted stock awards. The closing prices of Carolina Financial common stock and First South
common stock on June 30, 2017, were used in calculating these amounts. Importantly, these values are different from—and
significantly higher than—the valuations for purposes of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, which valuation is
determined as of the date of the change in control and is based on several factors, including the stock’s fair market value and
the length of time until the unvested equity grants would otherwise have vested, assuming no change in control.
 

(3) Messrs. McLean and Woodson are each party to a Change-in-Control Protective Agreement with First South. The amount
shown in the table represents a double-trigger (i.e., the payment is triggered by the occurrence of a change in control and is
conditioned upon a qualifying termination of each executive’s employment following a change in control) lump sum cash
severance payment the executive is entitled to under his Change-in-Control Protective Agreement.
 

(4) Each of Messrs. Elder, McLean, and Woodson are party to Salary Continuation Agreements with First South. The amounts in
this column represent the value of the lump sum payment to which each executive would be entitled under his Salary
Continuation Agreement upon a separation of service prior to normal retirement age following the change in control of First
South.
 

(5) Represents value of continuation of life and medical insurance benefits following a qualifying termination under Mr. Elder’s
Employment Agreement with First South.

Board of Directors and Management Following the Merger

Immediately following the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of Carolina Financial will consist of 13
members, which will include the 11 directors of Carolina Financial serving immediately prior to the merger and two directors of First
South serving immediately prior to the merger.

 
Jerold L. Rexroad will continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer, William A. Gehman, III will continue to

serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and M. J. Huggins III will continue to serve as Executive Vice President
and Secretary of Carolina Financial following the merger.

 
Following the merger, Bruce W. Elder, First South’s President and Chief Executive Officer, will be appointed to the board of

directors of CresCom Bank and its President of North Carolina Banking. Cornelius F. Sullivan, a Senior Vice President and Raleigh
Area Executive of First South, will serve in the same role for CresCom Bank.

 
Regulatory Clearances Required for the Merger

 
Completion of the merger between Carolina Financial and First South is subject to the prior receipt of all consents or

approvals of, or the provision of notices to, federal and state authorities required to complete the merger. The merger is subject to the
provision of notice to the Federal Reserve because the merger qualifies as a “waiver transaction” under applicable Federal Reserve
rules and regulations. The Federal Reserve has advised Carolina Financial of its non-objection to characterization of the merger as a
“waiver transaction.”

 
Under the merger agreement, it is contemplated that First South Bank will be merged with and into CresCom Bank

immediately following the consummation of the merger of First South and Carolina Financial. The bank merger is subject to the prior
approvals of the FDIC, SCBFI, and NCCOB. CresCom Bank filed the applications with the FDIC, SCBFI and NCCOB on July 12,
2017. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, none of the FDIC, the SCBFI, or the NCCOB had granted its approval.
FDIC approval or possible approval of the combination: (i) reflects only the view that the transaction does not contravene applicable
competitive standards imposed by law and is consistent with regulatory policies relating to safety and soundness; (ii) is not an opinion
that the proposed combination is financially favorable to the stockholders or that the FDIC has considered the adequacy of the terms of
the transaction; and (iii) is not an endorsement of, or recommendation for, the combination.

 
Exchange of Shares in the Merger

 
Carolina Financial intends to appoint Computershare to serve as exchange agent to handle the exchange of shares of First

South common stock for shares of Carolina Financial common stock. At the effective time of the merger, each share of First South
common stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, consisting of 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial
common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Carolina Financial common stock, without the need for any action by the
holders of First South common stock.

 
Promptly after the effective time of the merger, but in no event later than seven business days after the effective time of the

merger, Carolina Financial will cause the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more First South stock certificates a
letter of transmittal specifying, among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates
representing First South common stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent. The letter of
transmittal will also include instructions explaining the procedure for surrendering First South stock certificates in exchange for the
merger consideration. First South stockholders should not return First South stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card.

 
After the effective time of the merger, shares of First South common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be automatically

canceled and will cease to exist and each certificate, if any, that previously represented shares of First South common stock will
represent only the right to receive the merger consideration as described above. With respect to merger consideration deliverable upon
the surrender of First South stock certificates, until holders of such First South stock certificates have surrendered such stock
certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, those holders will not receive dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of
Carolina Financial common stock issuable as merger consideration with a record date after the effective time of the merger, and will
not receive interest on any cash in lieu of fractional shares.

In addition, holders of certificates that represented outstanding First South common stock immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be entitled to vote after the effective time of the merger at any meeting of Carolina Financial stockholders the
number of whole shares of Carolina Financial common stock into which such shares have been converted, even if such holder has not
surrendered such certificates for exchange as set forth above.

Carolina Financial or its exchange agent will maintain a book entry list of Carolina Financial common stock to which each
former First South stockholder is entitled. Certificates evidencing Carolina Financial common stock into which the stockholder’s First
South common stock has been converted will not be issued. Carolina Financial’s exchange agent will deliver a statement of such book
entry and other information as required by law within a reasonable time following the surrender of a Carolina Financial certificate.

First South stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Carolina Financial common stock pursuant to the merger. In
lieu of fractional shares, Carolina Financial will pay to each former First South stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive
a fractional share of Carolina Financial common stock an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest cent), without interest thereon,
equal to the product of (i) the volume-weighted average of the closing prices (rounded to the nearest full cent) of Carolina Financial
common stock on the NASDAQ for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the date which is five business days immediately prior
to the merger’s effective time, multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth) of Carolina Financial
common stock which such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive.

 
Carolina Financial stockholders need not take any action with respect to their shares of Carolina Financial common stock, and

will continue to hold their shares of Carolina Financial common stock after the effective time of the merger.
 

Carolina Financial Dividend Policy
 
Carolina Financial currently pays quarterly cash dividends of $0.04 per share on shares of its common stock and currently

intends to consider the declaration of a dividend on a quarterly basis. Any future determination regarding dividend or distribution
payments will be at the discretion of the Carolina Financial board of directors, subject to applicable limitations under Delaware law,
and will depend upon many factors, including results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital requirements and legal
requirements.

 
Listing of Carolina Financial Common Stock

 
It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the shares of Carolina Financial common stock to be issued to First South

stockholders pursuant to the merger (including those shares of Carolina Financial common stock to be issued upon conversion of the
First South equity-based awards) be authorized for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance.  

 
De-Listing and Deregistration of First South Stock

 
Upon completion of the merger, the First South common stock currently listed on NASDAQ will cease to be listed on

NASDAQ and will subsequently be deregistered under the Exchange Act.
 

Support Agreements
 
Each of First South’s directors and certain of its executive officers, in their capacities as stockholders of First South, entered

into a support agreement with Carolina Financial pursuant to which they each have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to vote their
shares, and to use reasonable efforts to cause all shares owned by such director or executive officer jointly with any other person over
which such director or executive officer has shared voting control to be voted, in favor of the merger agreement. At the close of
business on the record date for the First South special meeting, First South directors and executive officers who have executed support
agreements were entitled to vote 594,560 shares of, or approximately 6.26%, of First South common stock outstanding on that date.

 
No Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights

 
Under Delaware law and Virginia law, as well as the governing instruments of each company, neither the holders of Carolina

Financial common stock nor the holders of First South common stock are entitled to appraisal rights or dissenters’ rights in connection
with the merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
 

The following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, which is included as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement below
and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement. This summary
does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you.
Carolina Financial and First South encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety before making any decisions
regarding the merger as it is the legal document governing the merger and related transactions.

 
The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms

of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any factual information about Carolina Financial or First South. Carolina
Financial and First South are responsible for considering whether additional disclosure of material information is required to make the
statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus not misleading. Factual disclosures about Carolina Financial or First South
contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or Carolina Financial’s or First South’s public reports filed with the SEC may
supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Carolina Financial or First South contained in the merger agreement and
described in this summary. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Carolina Financial and
First South are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Carolina Financial and First South in connection with
negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the
merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, and were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between
the parties to the merger agreement rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject
to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from that generally relevant to stockholders or applicable to reports and
documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other,
which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The representations and warranties in the
merger agreement will not survive the completion of the merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement, and subsequent developments or new
information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions
should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can
Find More Information” beginning on page iii.

 
General

 
At the effective time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the merger

agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, First South will be merged with and into Carolina Financial,
the separate corporate existence of First South will cease, and Carolina Financial will be the surviving corporation of the merger. As of
the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be the certificate of incorporation of
Carolina Financial as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, and the bylaws of Carolina Financial as in effect immediately
prior to the effective time will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation. Effective as of the effective time of the merger, Carolina
Financial will cause the size of the board of directors of the surviving corporation to be 13 directors.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 106/222

 

Effective Time of the Merger
 
If the merger agreement is approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders of Carolina Financial and First South and all

other required governmental and other consents and approvals are received, and if the other conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the merger are satisfied or waived (as permitted), the merger will be consummated and effected on the date and at the
time that a certificate of merger reflecting the merger is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and articles of merger reflecting the
merger are filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission or at such later time mutually agreed upon by Carolina Financial and
First South and specified in the certificate of merger and articles of merger. Both parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the
effective time of the merger to occur within 10 business days after the last of the following dates to occur: (i) the effective date
(including expiration of any applicable waiting period) of the last required consent of any regulatory authority having authority over
and approving or exempting the merger. (ii) the date on which the stockholders of First South approve the merger agreement, and (iii)
the date on which the stockholders of Carolina Financial approve the agreement.

 
Assuming satisfaction of all of the conditions to consummation of the merger, the merger is expected to be made effective

during the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Merger Consideration

 
The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger, each share of First South common stock issued and

outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (except for shares of First South common stock owned, directly or
indirectly, by First South or Carolina Financial immediately before the effective time of the merger (excluding any of such shares that
are held (i) as a result of debts previously contracted, or (ii) in trust accounts or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity and
beneficially owned by third parties), which will be cancelled and cease to exist with no consideration paid) will be converted into the
right to receive 0.5200 (referred to as the “exchange ratio”) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Carolina Financial common stock
(“merger consideration”). If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is greater than $35.14 just prior to closing of the
merger and it has outperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, the exchange ratio will be
decreased automatically based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock
is less than $25.98 just prior to closing and it has underperformed the NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and
closing, First South can terminate the Agreement unless Carolina Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash
consideration to make up the difference, based upon the change in the NASDAQ Bank Index. Upon this conversion, such shares of
First South common stock will no longer be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares will cease to exist, except for the
right to receive the merger consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares).

 
No fractional shares of Carolina Financial common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead, cash will be

paid for any fraction of a share of Carolina Financial common stock to which any First South stockholder would otherwise be entitled
upon completion of the merger. The cash paid will be an amount equal to the fraction of a share of Carolina Financial common stock
otherwise issuable upon conversion multiplied by (i) the volume-weighted average of the closing prices (rounded to the nearest full
cent) of Carolina Financial common stock on NASDAQ for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the date which is five business
days immediately prior to the merger’s effective time, multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth) of
Carolina Financial common stock which such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive.

 
After the effective time of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of First South of shares of

First South common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
 

Dividends and Distributions
 
No dividends or other distributions with respect to Carolina Financial common stock with a record date on or after the

effective time of the merger will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate or book-entry shares that represented First South
common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger until the holder of such certificate or book-entry shares surrenders
such certificate or book-entry shares in accordance with the instructions received from the exchange agent. Following such surrender,
there will be paid, without interest, with respect to whole shares of Carolina Financial common stock that shares of First South
common stock represented by the certificate or book-entry shares have been converted into: (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date and a payment date on or after the effective time of the merger and on or
prior to the date of such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a
record date on or after the effective time of the merger and prior to the date of such surrender and a payment date subsequent to the
date of such surrender.

Conversion of Stock; Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards
 
Conversion of First South Common Stock. At the effective time of the merger, each share of First South common stock

outstanding generally will be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 0.5200 shares of Carolina Financial common stock,
subject to the possible adjustment of the exchange ratio as described above under “--Merger Consideration.”

 
Cash will also be exchanged for any fractional shares. Any First South stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to

receive a fraction of a share of Carolina Financial common stock in the merger will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the fraction of a share of Carolina Financial common stock otherwise issuable upon conversion multiplied by the
average of the daily closing prices of Carolina Financial common stock on NASDAQ for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day prior to the fifth business day immediately prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger is to occur.

 
Some shares of First South common stock may not be converted in the merger. Each outstanding share of First South common

stock owned by Carolina Financial, First South, or their respective subsidiaries (in each case other than shares of First South common
stock held on behalf of third parties or as a result of debts previously contracted) will be canceled at the effective time of the merger
and will cease to be outstanding.

 
Stock Options. First South has granted certain employees, officers and directors options to purchase First South common

stock under its equity compensation plans. Pursuant to these plans, all stock options outstanding at the time of a corporate transaction
such as the merger will vest and become fully exercisable upon the effective date of such corporate transaction. In connection with
entering into the merger agreement, First South has agreed to offer each of the current holders of its stock options the opportunity to
cancel, effective upon and subject to the merger, all of their respective stock options covering shares of First South’s common stock
having an exercise price per share less than the per share value of the merger consideration in exchange for a cash payment equal to the
per share value of the merger consideration minus the exercise price for each share of First South’s common stock subject to such stock
option. Any stock option not cashed out will convert into an option to acquire shares of Carolina Financial common stock, as adjusted
to reflect the exchange ratio.

 
 Restricted Stock Awards. First South has granted certain employees, officers and directors restricted stock awards under its

2008 Equity Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, all unvested restricted stock awards outstanding at the time of
a corporate transaction such as the merger will vest upon the effective date of such corporate transaction. Those shares will become
shares of Carolina Financial upon consummation of the merger.

 
Procedure for Receiving Merger Consideration

 
Promptly after the effective time of the merger, Carolina Financial will deposit with the exchange agent (i) the merger

consideration, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares and payments of any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to the merger agreement. The cash and shares deposited pursuant to the foregoing are referred to as
the “exchange fund.”

 
As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger (but in any event, no later than seven days after the

effective time of the merger), Carolina Financial will cause the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of First South
common stock immediately prior to the merger that were converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the
merger consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares
of First South common stock in exchange for the merger consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to the merger agreement. Each holder of First South common stock will be entitled to receive the
appropriate merger consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to the
merger agreement upon surrendering to the exchange agent such stockholder’s certificates or book-entry shares, together with a
properly executed letter of transmittal and any other documents required by the exchange agent. The merger consideration and any
other consideration paid under the merger agreement may be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted and withheld pursuant to
any applicable tax law. You should not return your certificates representing shares of First South common stock to the exchange agent
without a letter of transmittal, and you should not return your certificates representing First South common stock to First South.

 
If any shares of Carolina Financial common stock are to be issued as merger consideration to a person other than the person in

whose name the certificates or book-entry shares representing shares of First South common stock are registered, it will be a condition
to such issuance that such surrendered First South certificate or book-entry share is properly endorsed with a medallion signature

or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement such that, had Carolina Financial known of
such condition or requirement, it would not have entered into the merger agreement, or (2) adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of either party to perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement.

In addition, First South has agreed that neither it, nor its affiliates or representatives, will solicit an acquisition proposal
(generally, a tender offer or proposal for a merger, asset acquisition, or other business combination), other than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, except to the extent necessary to comply with the fiduciary
duties of their board of directors, neither First South, nor any affiliate or representative of such party, will, prior to the stockholder vote
on the merger agreement and subject to certain exceptions, furnish any non-public information that it is not legally obligated to furnish,
or negotiate with respect to, or enter into any contract with respect to, any acquisition proposal. In the merger agreement, First South
also agreed to terminate any existing negotiations with any other parties with respect to any of the foregoing and agreed to use its
reasonable efforts to cause its representatives to comply with any of the foregoing.

 
Restrictions on Solicitation

 
Except as described below, First South has agreed that, from the time of the execution of the merger agreement until the

earlier of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, it will not, and will cause its affiliates and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly facilitate, induce or knowingly encourage the making,
submission, or announcement of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to a proposal that
constitutes, an acquisition proposal; (ii) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public information in connection with, any acquisition proposal, or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or encourage or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations
or any effort or attempt to make an acquisition proposal; (iii) enter into any agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to an
acquisition proposal; or (iv) propose to do any of the foregoing. First South has, and has caused each of its respective subsidiaries and
each of its and its respective subsidiaries’ representatives to, cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with
any person that may be ongoing with respect to any acquisition proposal, and terminated all physical and electronic data room access
previously granted to any such person or its representatives.

 
An “acquisition proposal” means any proposal that is communicated to First South’s chief executive officer, chief financial

officer or board of directors or publicly announced to First South’s stockholders by a third party (other than Carolina Financial or any
of its affiliates) for an acquisition transaction involving First South or any of its present or future consolidated subsidiaries, or any
combination of such subsidiaries, the assets of which constitute 5% or more of the consolidated assets of First South as reflected on
First South’s consolidated statement of condition. An “acquisition transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions
(other than the proposed merger with Carolina Financial) involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase from First South by a third party of
25% or more in interest of the total outstanding voting securities of First South or any of its subsidiaries, or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any third party beneficially owning 25% or more in interest of the total outstanding
voting securities of First South or any of its subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving First South pursuant to which the stockholders of First South immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 75% of
the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (ii) any sale or lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), or exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of 5% or more of the
assets of First South; or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of First South.

 
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to obtaining the relevant stockholder approval, if First

South receives an acquisition proposal and First South’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a superior proposal,
First South and its representatives may furnish (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement meeting certain requirements set forth in the
merger agreement) non-public information with respect to First South and its subsidiaries to and engage in discussions or negotiations
with the person who made the proposal and its representatives (provided that, (i) at least two business prior to furnishing any such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, First South gives Carolina Financial written
notice of the identity of such person or group and of First South’s intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or group and (ii) First South contemporaneously furnishes such non-public information to
Carolina Financial, if such information was not previously provided to Carolina Financial or its representatives).

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 114/222

 

A “superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal made by a third party that if consummated would
result in such third party owning more than 50% of the shares of First South common stock or all or substantially all of First South’s
assets and which First South’s board of directors has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and that is reasonably likely to
result in the consummation of a transaction more favorable to the stockholders of First South than the merger, taking into account such
factors as the board of directors in good faith deems relevant, including legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal,
and any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Carolina Financial in response to such proposal or otherwise.

 
Changes in Board Recommendations

 
The board of directors of First South has agreed, subject to certain exceptions discussed below, not to (i) fail to recommend

the approval of the merger agreement, (ii) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to take such an action, in
a manner adverse to the other party, their respective recommendations with respect to the merger, (iii) take any formal action or make
any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation of rejection
of such offer or a temporary “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (iv) adopt,
approve or recommend an acquisition proposal. In addition, subject to certain exceptions described below and in the merger agreement,
the board of directors of First South has agreed not to cause or permit their respective companies, or any subsidiaries thereof, to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement meeting certain requirements set forth in the merger agreement).

 
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the relevant stockholder approval, the board of director

each of First South is permitted to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party its
recommendations with respect to the merger if, subject to certain conditions, the board of directors of First South, among other things,
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that an acquisition proposal received
after the date of the merger agreement constitutes a superior proposal.

 
Prior to making a change in recommendation as described above, First South must (i) inform Carolina Financial in writing of

its board of directors’ intention to change its recommendation at least five business days in advance, (ii) provide to Carolina Financial
the material terms and conditions of and identity of the person making the acquisition proposal, as well as a copy of all written
materials with or from the party making such acquisition proposal, and (iii) negotiate (and cause its representatives to negotiate) in
good faith with Carolina Financial during such notice period, to the extent that Carolina Financial wishes to negotiate, to enable
Carolina Financial to revise the terms of the merger agreement such that it would cause the superior proposal to no longer constitute a
superior proposal. Following the end of such notice period, the First South board of directors must consider in good faith any changes
to the merger agreement proposed in writing by Carolina Financial, and must have determined that the superior proposal would
continue to constitute a superior proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. If material revisions to an acquisition proposal
would have an impact, influence or other effect on First South’s board of directors’ decision or discussion with respect to whether such
proposal constitutes a superior proposal, First South’s board of directors must deliver to Carolina Financial a new written notice and
again comply with the procedures set forth in this paragraph, except that the five business day period described above becomes a three
business day period.

 
Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Approvals

 
Each party has agreed to hold its special meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable, for the purposes of seeking the required

approvals of its stockholders related to the merger agreement and the merger and, unless the board of directors of such party has
changed its recommendation as permitted by the merger agreement, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the requisite
stockholder approval for such proposals.

practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other
filings, and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary

· each party will keep the other party reasonably informed with respect to the defense or settlement of any securityholder action
against it or its directors or officers relating to the merger or other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, will

will not settle any such action without the other party’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed);
 

· whether or not the merger is consummated, except as otherwise expressly provided in the merger agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be borne by the
party incurring such expenses;
 

· neither party will issue or cause the publication of, or permit any of its subsidiaries or agents to issue or cause the publication
of, any press release or other public announcement with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
without the prior consent of the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), provided that either party may,
without the prior written consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable
under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, to the extent required by law or NASDAQ rules or regulations.

· First South’s delivery of fully executed non-employee director non-competition agreements, stockholder support agreements,
claims letters, and employment agreements executed by Bruce W. Elder and Cornelius F. Sullivan with CresCom Bank; and

 
· the absence of any change, state of facts, event, development or effect since March 31, 2017 that has had or would reasonably

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on First South.

Governance of the Combined Company Following the Completion of the Transaction
 
Carolina Financial has agreed to take all requisite action, effective as of the effective time of the merger, to cause the Carolina

Financial board of directors to consist of 13 directors, which will include: (i)  the then-current 11 members of the Carolina Financial
board of directors, and (ii) two of the then-current members of the First South board of directors (as mutually agreed upon by First
South and Carolina Financial). The parties have agreed that the board of directors of Carolina Financial (or the appropriate committee
thereof) will cause each of the First South continuing directors to be nominated for election at the at the next annual meeting of
stockholders of Carolina Financial at which such director’s class is nominated for re-election.

 
Effective as of the effective time of the consolidation of the parties’ respective subsidiary banks, Carolina Financial has agreed

that CresCom Bank will take all requisite action, effective as of the effective time of such consolidation, to cause the CresCom Bank
board of directors to consist of 14 directors, which will include: (i) the then-current 13 members of the CresCom Bank board of
directors, and (ii) Bruce W. Elder. The CresCom Bank board of directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) will cause Mr. Elder to
be nominated for re-election at the next annual meeting of the stockholders of CresCom Bank.

 
Effective as of the effective time of the merger (and, with respect to positions with CresCom Bank, effective as of the effective

time of the bank consolidation), (i) Jerold L. Rexroad will continue as a director and as Chief Executive Officer and President of
Carolina Financial and as Executive Chairman of CresCom Bank, (ii) David L. Morrow will continue as a director and as Executive
Vice President of Carolina Financial and Chief Executive Officer of CresCom Bank, (iii) William A. Gehman, III will continue as
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Carolina Financial and CresCom Bank, (iv) M.J. Huggins, III will continue as
Executive Vice President and Secretary of Carolina Financial and CresCom Bank, (v) Bruce W. Elder will become and serve as a
director of CresCom Bank and as its President of North Carolina Banking, (vi) Cornelius F. Sullivan will become and serve as Senior
Vice President and Raleigh Area Executive of CresCom Bank, (vii) the directors of First South who are not appointed to the board of
Carolina Financial will be named to an advisory board of CresCom Bank. The biographies of Messrs. Rexroad, Morrow, Gehman,
Huggins and Carolina Financial’s current directors are included in Carolina Financial’s definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for
its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, filed March 20, 2017, and are incorporated herein by reference. The biographies of Mr. Elder
and First South’s current directors are included in First South’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2016, filed on March 15, 2017 and amended on April 28, 2017, and are incorporated herein by reference.

 
Indemnification and Insurance

 
Carolina Financial will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless, and provide advancement of reasonable expenses to each of the

current or former directors or officers of First South or its subsidiaries against all liabilities arising out of actions or omissions arising
out of their service or services as directors, officers, employees, or agents of First South or its subsidiaries, occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the merger to the fullest extent permitted by law and by First South’s governing documents.

 
For a period of six years following the effective time of the merger, the Carolina Financial will purchase (or will direct First

South to purchase) policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the effective time of the merger by such directors and officers currently covered by First South’s similar policies.
However, after the effective time of the merger, Carolina Financial will not be required to pay annual premiums for insurance
coverages in excess of 200% of the annual premium paid by First South prior to the date of the merger agreement (referred to as the
“maximum amount”) in respect of the coverages required to be obtained, but in such case will purchase the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the maximum amount.

 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons

controlling Carolina Financial pursuant to the provisions discussed above, Carolina Financial has been informed that in the opinion of
the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Amendment, Waiver, and Termination
 
The merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the receipt of the First South stockholder

approval or the Carolina Financial stockholder approval by action taken or authorized by the parties’ respective boards of directors.
After receipt of any such approval, no amendment will be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange requires further approval by the First South stockholders or the Carolina Financial stockholders, as applicable, without such
further stockholder approval. The merger agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
Carolina Financial and First South.

 
Prior to or at the effective time of the merger, either First South or Carolina Financial may waive any default in the

performance of any term of the merger agreement by the other party, may waive or extend the time for the fulfillment by the other party
of any of its obligations under the merger agreement, and may waive any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such party
under the merger agreement, except any condition that, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of an applicable law.

 
The merger agreement may be terminated, and the merger abandoned, at any time prior to its effective time, by mutual

consent of the boards of directors of First South and Carolina Financial. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated, and the
merger abandoned, prior to the effective time of the merger by either First South or Carolina Financial if:

 
· the other party breaches any representation or warranty in the merger agreement which cannot be or is not cured within 30

days of notice of such breach; provided, that such breach is reasonably likely, in the opinion of the non-breaching party, to
permit such party to refuse to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

 
· any regulatory authority whose approval is required for consummation of the merger makes a final non-appealable

decision not to approve the merger; any final law or order permanently restrains, enjoins, or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the merger; First South stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement at the First South special
meeting; or Carolina Financial stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement at the Carolina Financial special
meeting; or

 
· the merger has not been consummated by March 31, 2018.

 
Carolina Financial may terminate the merger prior to the approval by the requisite vote of the First South stockholders if:
 
· the board of directors of First South withdraws, qualifies, or modifies, or proposes publicly to withdraw, quality or

modify, in a manner adverse to Carolina Financial, its recommendation that the First South stockholders approve the
merger agreement, or approves or recommends, or proposes publicly to approve or recommend an acquisition proposal by
any other person;

 
· the board of directors of First South fails to reaffirm its recommendation that the First South stockholders approve the

merger agreement within 10 business days after Carolina Financial requests such reaffirmation at any time following the
public announcement of an acquisition proposal by any other person; or

 
· First South fails to comply in all material aspects with Section 7.1 (Shareholder Approvals) or 7.3 (Other Offers, etc.) of

the merger agreement regarding obtaining stockholder approval for the merger agreement and solicitation of other offers
for an acquisition of First South.

In this event, First South must pay Carolina Financial a termination fee of $5,750,000.

If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to closing and it has underperformed the
NASDAQ Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, First South can terminate the merger agreement unless Carolina
Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash consideration to make up the difference, based upon the change in the
NASDAQ Bank Index.

First South can also terminate the merger agreement if First South’s stockholders do not approve the merger agreement at the
First South special meeting, and prior to the First South special meeting, First South received a superior proposal which did not result
from a breach of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, and First South’s board of directors determines to enter
into a definitive agreement for such proposal upon termination of the merger agreement and enters into such agreement concurrently
with its termination of the merger agreement. In this event, First South must pay a $5,750,000 termination fee to Carolina Financial.

In addition, if (i) an acquisition proposal with respect to First South is communicated to the stockholders, senior management,
or board of directors of First South or any person publicly announces an intention to make an acquisition proposal with respect to First
South after the date of the merger agreement, (ii) the merger agreement is then terminated due to a failure to obtain the First South
stockholder vote, a material breach of the merger agreement by First South, or failure to close the merger by March 31, 2018, and (iii)
within one year after the termination of the merger agreement, First South consummates an acquisition transaction or enters into an
acquisition agreement, then it must pay the $5,750,000 termination fee to Carolina Financial.

Governing Law
 
The merger agreement is governed by the laws of South Carolina.
  

No Third Party Beneficiaries
 
While the merger agreement is not intended to confer upon you or any other person other than Carolina Financial and First

South any rights or remedies, it provides limited exceptions for (i) First South’s and its subsidiaries’ directors and officers to continue
to have indemnification and liability insurance coverage after the completion of the merger, and (ii) holders of First South common
stock after the effective time of the merger and any holder of an award granted under a First South stock plan to properly convert their
shares of common stock and awards pursuant to the merger agreement.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES AND OPINION OF TAX COUNSEL
 

Subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described herein, in the opinion of Nelson Mullins Riley &
Scarborough, LLP, the following discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
generally applicable to “U.S. holders” (as defined below) of First South common stock that exchange their shares in the merger. This
summary is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authorities, published positions of the IRS and
other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this discussion and all of which are subject to change (possibly with
retroactive effect) and differing interpretations. The opinion of tax counsel for Carolina Financial is filed as Exhibit 8.1 to the
registration statement on Form S-4 of which this document is a part.
 

This summary is limited to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold their shares of First South common stock as a capital
asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Furthermore, this discussion does not
address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular First South stockholder or to First South stockholders that are
subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: stockholders that are not U.S. holders; financial institutions;
insurance companies; mutual funds; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors in such
entities); regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; dealers in securities or currencies; persons subject to the
alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code; former citizens or residents of the United States; persons whose functional currency is
not the U.S. dollar; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting; persons who own more than 5% of the
outstanding common stock of First South; persons who hold First South common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or
conversion transaction; and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of First South common stock through the exercise of an employee
stock option or otherwise as compensation.
 

For purposes of this section, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of First South common stock that for United
States federal income tax purposes is: a citizen or resident of the United States; a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; or a trust, the substantial decisions
of which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons and which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court, or a trust that
validly has elected under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds First South common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partners and the activities of
the partnership. Partnerships and partners in such a partnership should consult their tax advisers about the tax consequences of the
merger to them.
 

Holders of First South common stock are urged to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the
merger in their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state,
local or foreign and other tax laws and of any changes in those laws.
 
The Merger
 

The merger will constitute a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Consummation of the merger
is conditioned upon Carolina Financial and First South receiving a written tax opinion, dated the closing date of the merger, from
Carolina Financial’s outside legal counsel to the effect that, based upon facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion,
(i) the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
(ii) Carolina Financial and First South will each be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. An
opinion of counsel represents the counsel’s best legal judgment and is not binding on the IRS or any court, and as a result, there can be
no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any such opinion. In addition, if any of
the representations or assumptions upon which the opinion is based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger could be adversely affected. Accordingly, each First South stockholder should consult its tax advisor with
respect to the particular tax consequences of the merger to such holder.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm 122/222

 

Consequences to Carolina Financial and First South
 

Each of Carolina Financial and First South will be a party to the merger within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code,
and neither Carolina Financial nor First South will recognize any gain or loss as a result of the merger.
 
Consequences to Shareholders
 

If the closing price of Carolina Financial common stock is less than $25.98 just prior to closing and it has underperformed the
Nasdaq Bank Index by 15% or more between signing and closing, First South can terminate the merger agreement unless Carolina
Financial elects to increase the exchange ratio or add cash consideration to make up the difference, based upon the change in the
Nasdaq Bank Index. In such instance, if Carolina Financial were to elect to add cash consideration to avoid termination of the merger
agreement, we anticipate the merger would continue to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
However, for purposes of describing the federal income tax consequences of the merger to a First South stockholder we are assuming
that such contingency has not occurred and the only consideration received by a U.S. Holder of First South common stock is Carolina
Financial common stock (except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share).
 

No Gain or Loss Recognized. A U.S. Holder will not recognize any gain or loss except in respect of cash received in lieu of
any fractional share of Carolina Financial common stock (as discussed below).
 

Cash Received in Lieu of a Fractional Share. If a U.S. holder receives cash in the merger instead of a fractional share interest
in Carolina Financial common stock, the U.S. holder will be treated as having received such fractional share in the merger, and then as
having received cash in exchange for such fractional share. Gain or loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received and the First South stockholder’s adjusted tax basis allocable to such fractional share. This gain or
loss generally will be a capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the merger, the U.S.
holder held its shares of First South common stock for more than one year.
 

Tax Basis in, and Holding Period for, Carolina Financial Common Stock. The aggregate tax basis of the Carolina Financial
common stock received by a U.S. holder as a result of the merger (including any fractional share deemed received and redeemed as
described below) will be the same as such stockholder’s aggregate tax basis in its First South common stock surrendered in the merger.
The holding period of the Carolina Financial common stock (including any fractional share deemed received and redeemed as
described below) a U.S. holder receives as a result of the exchange will include the holding period of First South common stock
surrendered in the merger. If a U.S. holder has differing bases or holding periods in respect of its shares of First South common stock, it
should consult its tax advisor with regard to identifying the bases or holding periods of the particular shares of Carolina Financial
common stock received in the exchange.
 

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. A non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject under certain circumstances to
information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on any cash payments received. A U.S. holder generally will
not be subject to backup withholding, however, if such U.S. holder (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that
it is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise comply with all the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; or
(2) provide proof that it is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are
not an additional tax and generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided such U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the application of backup withholding based on their particular circumstances and the availability and procedure for
obtaining an exemption from backup withholding.
 

A First South stockholder who receives Carolina Financial common stock as a result of the merger will be required to retain
records pertaining to the merger. Each First South stockholder who is required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and who is a
“significant holder” that receives Carolina Financial common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement with such U.S.
federal income tax return in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3 setting forth information regarding the parties to the
merger, the date of the merger, such First South stockholder’s basis in the First South common stock surrendered and the fair market
value of the Carolina Financial common stock and cash received in the merger. A “significant holder” is a holder of First South
common stock who, immediately before the merger, owned at least 5% of the outstanding stock of First South or securities of First
South with a basis for federal income tax purposes of at least $1 million.
 
THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO OR A DISCUSSION OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF
TAXES. FIRST SOUTH SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, THE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT
 

The merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting within generally accepted accounting principles.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory
contracts and other commitments) of First South as of the effective date of the merger will be recorded at their respective fair values
and added to those of Carolina Financial. Any excess of purchase price over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
will be recorded as goodwill. Financial statements of Carolina Financial issued after the merger will reflect these fair values and will
not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of First South before the effective date of
the merger.

COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF CAROLINA FINANCIAL AND FIRST SOUTH STOCKHOLDERS
 

At the effective time of the merger, holders of First South common stock who receive Carolina Financial common stock as
merger consideration will become holders of Carolina Financial common stock. The following is a summary of the material differences
between the rights of holders of Carolina Financial common stock and the rights of holders of First South common stock. Since
Carolina Financial is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and First South is organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, differences in the rights of holders of Carolina Financial common stock and those of holders of First South
common stock arise from differing provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) and the Virginia Stock Corporation
Act (“VSCA”), in addition to differing provisions of their respective certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws.

 
This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the provisions affecting and differences between the rights of

Carolina Financial stockholders and First South stockholders. The identification of specific provisions or differences is not meant to
indicate that other equally or more significant differences do not exist. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
DGCL and the VSCA and to the governing corporate documents of Carolina Financial and First South, to which the stockholders of
First South are referred.

office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders at which the term of office of the class to which they have been chosen
expires.

forth in the bylaws. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made by timely
notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered or mailed to and received at
the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting; provided, however, that in the
event that less than 100 days’ notice or prior disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such

each person whom such stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to such
person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as
a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving notice of (x) the name and address, as they
appear on the corporation’s books, of such stockholder and (y) the number of shares of the corporation’s capital stock that are
beneficially owned by such stockholder. At the request of the board of directors any person nominated by the board of directors for
election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in a stockholder’s notice
of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated
in accordance with advance notice provisions. The officer of the corporation or other person presiding at the meeting shall, if the facts
so warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with such provisions and, if he or she should so determine, he or
she shall declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding was authorized
by the board of directors of the corporation. The foregoing right to indemnification includes the right to an “advancement of expenses;”
provided, however, that if the indemnitee is a director or officer of the corporation, he or she shall deliver an undertaking to the
corporation to repay all amount so advanced if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification. The corporation may, as authorized by the board of directors, grant the rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation.

First South’s articles of incorporation provide that First South shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permissible under the

First South’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
other enterprise or employee benefit plan, in any proceeding in which the individual is made a party as a result of his service in such
capacity. Reasonable expenses incurred by any such person will be paid or reimbursed by First South in advance of the final disposition
of the proceeding upon receipt by First South of: (i) a written statement by such person of his good faith belief that the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification by First South has been met; and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of such person to
repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.

vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (after giving effect to the provisions of voting limit described above), voting

their capacity as stockholders of Carolina Financial, where the business combination has been approved a majority of the disinterested
directors, or in the case of any other business combination, where the business combination has been approved by a majority of the

Appraisal or dissenters’ rights are rights that, if available under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary

transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a
judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.
Under the DGCL and the VSCA, as well as the governing documents of each company, neither the holders of Carolina Financial
common stock nor the holders of First South common stock are entitled to appraisal rights or dissenters’ rights in connection with the
merger.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
 
A Carolina Financial stockholder seeking to present a proposal at a Carolina Financial annual meeting of stockholders must

submit a notice to the Secretary of Carolina Financial in accordance with Carolina Financial’s bylaws not less than 120 calendar days
prior to the date corresponding to the date of Carolina Financial’s proxy statement or notice of meeting released to stockholders in
connection with the last preceding annual meeting of stockholders, in the case of an annual meeting (unless Carolina Financial did not
hold an annual meeting within the last year, or if the date of the upcoming annual meeting changed by more than 30 days from the date
of the last preceding meeting, then the notice must be delivered or mailed and received not more than 10 days after the earlier of the
date of the notice of the meeting or public disclosure of the date of the meeting), and not more than ten days after the earlier of the date
of the notice of the meeting or public disclosure of the date of the meeting, in the case of a special meeting. A Carolina Financial
stockholder seeking to include a proposal in Carolina Financial’s proxy statement and form of proxy relating to a meeting of
stockholders must submit the proposal to Carolina Financial in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8. With respect to Carolina Financial’s
2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the deadline to submit a notice of a proposal and to include a proposal in Carolina Financial’s
proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the meeting is November 20, 2017.

 
A Carolina Financial stockholder seeking to nominate an individual for election as a Carolina Financial director must submit a

notice to the Secretary of Carolina Financial in accordance with the Carolina Financial Bylaws not less than 120 days prior to the date
of the meeting, in the case of an annual meeting, and not more than seven days following the date of notice of the meeting, in the case
of a special meeting.

 
First South does not currently anticipate holding an annual meeting of stockholders in 2018. However, if the merger is not

completed as anticipated, First South may hold a 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. If such an annual meeting is held, it will not
likely fall within 30 days of the anniversary of First South’s 2017 annual meeting, which was held on June 29, 2017. Accordingly,
under SEC rules, if First South holds a 2018 annual meeting, stockholder proposals must be submitted a reasonable time before First
South begins to print and send its proxy materials. Such proposals will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under
the Exchange Act and First South’s Bylaws.

 
Under First South’s articles of incorporation, in order for a stockholder to make a proposal for business to be brought before

the 2018 annual meeting or to nominate an individual for election as a First South director at the 2018 annual meeting, if such a
meeting is held, the stockholder must submit each such notice to First South’s Secretary not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days
prior to such meeting (however, if less than 40 days’ notice of the meeting, is given to the stockholders, then notice must be received
by First South’s Secretary no later than the tenth day following the day on which notice of the annual meeting was mailed or made
public).

 
OTHER MATTERS PRESENTED AT THE MEETINGS

 
As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, neither the Carolina Financial board of directors nor the First South

board of directors knows of any matters that will be presented for consideration at either the Carolina Financial special meeting or the
First South special meeting, respectively, other than as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If any other matters come
before either the Carolina Financial special meeting or the First South special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and
are voted upon, the proposed proxy will be deemed to confer authority to the individuals named as authorized therein to vote the shares
represented by the proxy and the persons named in the enclosed proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their
discretion on such matters.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION
 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this “Agreement”) dated as of June 9,
2017, is by and between Carolina Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Carolina Financial”), and First South Bancorp, Inc.,
a Virginia corporation (“First South”). Except as otherwise set forth herein, capitalized and certain other terms used herein shall have

RECITALS
 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Carolina Financial and First South have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and shareholders for Carolina Financial to acquire First South pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and have unanimously approved the merger of First South with and into Carolina Financial, with Carolina Financial being
the surviving entity (the “Merger”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby the issued and
outstanding shares of First South Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration from Carolina
Financial;
 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Carolina Financial has adopted this Agreement, duly authorized the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and resolved to recommend that Carolina Financial’s stockholders approve this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;
 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of First South has adopted this Agreement, duly authorized the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and resolved to recommend that First South’s shareholders approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;
 

WHEREAS, it is intended that, immediately following the Merger, or as soon as is practicable thereafter, First South Bank, a
North Carolina bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of First South, will be merged with and into CresCom Bank, a South Carolina
banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Carolina Financial, so that CresCom Bank is the surviving bank;

 
WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the

provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”); and
 

WHEREAS, Carolina Financial and First South desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements
in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;
 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements
set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration and the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
 

ARTICLE 1

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, First South shall be merged with and into
Carolina Financial pursuant to and with the effect provided in Section 252 of the DGCL and Section 13.1-716 of the VSCA, and
Carolina Financial shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the

1.2 Time and Place of Closing.

The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Closing”) will take place at 12:01 A.M. Eastern Time on the date
that the Effective Time occurs (the “Effective Date”), or at such other time as the Parties, acting through their authorized officers, may
mutually agree. The Closing shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and may be effected by
electronic or other transmission of signature pages, as mutually agreed upon.

 
1.3 Effective Time.

      The Merger shall be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger reflecting the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State
(the “Certificate of Merger”) and Articles of Merger reflecting the Merger with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the
“Articles of Merger”). The Merger shall become effective (the “Effective Time”) when the Certificate of Merger and Articles of
Merger have been filed or at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Carolina Financial and First South and specified in the
Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in
writing by the authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur within
10 business days after the last of the following dates to occur: (i) the effective date (including expiration of any applicable waiting
period) of the last required Consent of any Regulatory Authority having authority over and approving or exempting the Merger, (ii) the
date on which the shareholders of First South approve this Agreement; and (iii) the date on which the stockholders of Carolina
Financial approve this Agreement.

 
1.4 Restructure of Transaction.

Carolina Financial shall have the right to revise the structure of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement by merging First
South with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Carolina Financial, provided, that no such revision to the structure of the Merger (i)
shall result in any changes in the amount or type of the consideration which the holders of shares of First South Common Stock are
entitled to receive under this Agreement, (ii) would unreasonably impede or delay consummation of the Merger, or (iii) imposes any
less favorable terms or conditions on First South or First South Bank. In such event, Carolina Financial will give written notice to First
South in the manner provided in Section 10.8, which notice shall be in the form of an amendment to this Agreement, in the form of a
proposed amendment to this Agreement, or in the form of an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, and the addition of such other exhibits hereto as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect such change.

 
1.5 Bank Merger; Directors and Officers of the Surviving Bank.

(a)                Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, CresCom Bank and
First South Bank shall enter into the Bank Agreement of Merger, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, with such changes thereto as
Carolina Financial and First South mutually agree to, pursuant to which First South Bank will merge with and into CresCom Bank (the
“Bank Merger”), with CresCom Bank as the surviving institution (the “Surviving Bank”). The Parties intend that the Bank Merger will

(b)                The Bank Agreement of Merger shall provide that the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Bank
shall be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of CresCom Bank as in effect immediately prior to the Bank Merger until otherwise
duly amended or repealed.

(c)                The Bank Agreement of Merger shall provide that the directors of the Surviving Bank shall be the directors of
CresCom Bank serving immediately prior to the Bank Merger from and after the effective time of the Bank Merger, in accordance with
the Surviving Bank’s Bylaws, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director. Prior to the effective
time of the Bank Merger, CresCom Bank shall take all action necessary to appoint Bruce W. Elder as a director of the Surviving Bank,
to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the next business day following the effective time of the Bank Merger, and to cause Mr. Elder to be
nominated as a board nominee for re-election by the shareholders at the next annual meeting of shareholders of the Surviving Bank
following his appointment to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Bank. It is anticipated that the directors of First South Bank in
office immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger, other than Mr. Elder, shall serve as the Surviving Bank’s Eastern
North Carolina Advisory Board and shall be entitled to receive a fee of $500.00 for each advisory board meeting attended. The
Surviving Bank’s Eastern North Carolina Advisory Board is expected to meet no less than three times per year.

(d)                The Bank Agreement of Merger shall provide that the officers of the Surviving Bank shall be the officers of
CresCom Bank serving immediately prior to the Bank Merger, together with such additional persons as may hereafter be appointed,
from and after the effective time of the Bank Merger in accordance with the Surviving Bank’s Bylaws, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Bruce W. Elder, who shall be the President of North Carolina Banking of the Surviving Bank, and
Cornelius F. Sullivan, who shall be the Senior Vice President and Raleigh Area Executive of the Surviving Bank, shall enter into
employment agreements in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits H and I, respectively, which shall become effective only upon the
Effective Time.

1.6               Tax Treatment of the Merger.
 

It is intended by the Parties that the Merger constitute a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
The Parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3(a). All of the Parties agree to cooperate and use their best efforts in order to qualify the transactions contemplated herein as
a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, to not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger
to fail to so qualify, and to report the Merger for federal, state and any local income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such
characterization.
 

ARTICLE 2

ARTICLE 3 
MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

3.1 Effect on First South Common Stock.

(a)                At the Effective Time, in each case subject to Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.1(d) and 3.1(f), by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties, each share of First South Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Extinguished Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.5200 shares (the “Exchange
Ratio”) of Carolina Financial Common Stock (the “Merger Consideration”).

(b)                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and notwithstanding the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Carolina Financial and/or the shareholders of First South, the Exchange Ratio shall be decreased as set forth in Section
3.1(c) if (A) the Carolina Financial Average Closing Price is greater than $35.14, and (B) (x) the number obtained by dividing the
Carolina Financial Average Closing Price by the Initial Price (the “Closing Price Change Ratio”) is more than 0.15 greater than (y) the
number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price (the “Index Change Ratio”).

(c)                If the conditions of Section 3.1(b) are satisfied, the Exchange Ratio shall become the ratio obtained by multiplying
(A) the quotient of the Per Share Purchase Price divided by the Carolina Final Average Closing Price by (B) the sum of the Index
Change Ratio plus 0.15.

(d)                At the Effective Time, all shares of First South Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of First South Common Stock (the “Certificates”) and each non-certificated share of First South Common Stock (the “First
South Book-Entry Shares”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive applicable payments as set forth in Section 3.8.

(e)                If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of First South Common Stock, First South Options, or the
outstanding shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock or any rights with respect to Carolina Financial Common Stock pursuant to
stock options or other equity-based awards granted by Carolina Financial under the Carolina Financial Corporation 2013 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “Carolina Financial Awards”) shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per
Share Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, Carolina Financial shall have the right to grant additional Carolina Financial Awards
prior to the Effective Date under the Carolina Financial Corporation 2013 Equity Incentive Plan without triggering an adjustment to the
Per Share Purchase Price under this Section 3.1(e).

(f)                 Each share of First South Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
owned by either of the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries (in each case other than shares of First South Common Stock held on
behalf of third parties or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and shall
cease to exist (the “Extinguished Shares”).

3.2 Exchange Procedures.

(a)                   Promptly after the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration and cash in an aggregate amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional
shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock to which holders of First South Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.6
(collectively, the “Exchange Fund”). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Carolina Financial shall promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the
amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section
3.2 and Section 3.6, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.

(b)                   Unless different timing is agreed to by Carolina Financial and First South, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but in any event no more than seven business days after the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to the former shareholders of First South appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or other instruments theretofore representing shares of First South
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or other instruments to the Exchange Agent). In the event of
a transfer of ownership of shares of First South Common Stock represented by one or more Certificates or First South Book-Entry
Shares that are not registered in the transfer records of First South, the Merger Consideration payable for such shares as provided in
Section 3.1 may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares representing such shares are
delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence such transfer and by evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that such transfer is proper and that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. In the event
any Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares representing First South Common Stock shall have been lost, mutilated, stolen,
destroyed or are otherwise missing, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate or First South
Book-Entry Shares to be lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed or otherwise missing and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or Carolina Financial with respect to such Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares the Merger Consideration as
provided for in Section 3.1. The Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and procedures in
connection with its duties as it may deem appropriate. Carolina Financial shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Exchange Agent in connection with the distribution of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1. Carolina Financial or its
Exchange Agent will maintain a book entry list of Carolina Financial Common Stock to which each former holder of First South
Common Stock is entitled. Certificates evidencing Carolina Financial Common Stock into which First South Common Stock has been
converted will not be issued.

(c)                Unless different timing is agreed to by Carolina Financial and First South, after the Effective Time, each holder of
shares of First South Common Stock (other than Extinguished Shares) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the
Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares representing such shares to the Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon
surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in Section 3.1, without interest, pursuant to this Section 3.2.
The Certificate or Certificates of First South Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require. Carolina Financial shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former holder of First
South Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holder’s Certificate or Certificates or First
South Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(b)) for exchange as provided in this Section 3.2.
Similarly, no dividends or other distributions in respect of the Carolina Financial Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate or Certificates or First South Book-
Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(b)) are surrendered for exchange as provided in this Section
3.2. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither any Carolina Financial Entities, nor any First South Entities, nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of First South Common Stock for any amounts paid or properly delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.

(d)                Each of Carolina Financial and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of First South Common Stock and First South Options such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local, or foreign Tax Law or by any Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld
by Carolina Financial, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of First South Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Carolina Financial, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be.

(e)                Any portion of the Merger Consideration and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by Carolina Financial pursuant
to Section 3.2(a) that remains unclaimed by the holder of shares of First South Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time
(as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Carolina Financial. Any holder of
shares of First South Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with Section 3.2(c) shall thereafter look only to Carolina
Financial for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of First South Common Stock such holder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of First South Common Stock or First
South Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Carolina
Financial Common Stock and cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the unclaimed
items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of Carolina Financial
(and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any
Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares for any consideration paid to a Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Carolina Financial and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
First South to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall
be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate or
Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares, Carolina Financial and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration
represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

(f)                 Adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of First South shall constitute ratification of the appointment of the
Exchange Agent.

3.3 Effect on Carolina Financial Common Stock.

At and after the Effective Time, each share of Carolina Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of Carolina Financial and shall not be affected by the
Merger.
 

3.4 First South Options and Equity-Based Awards.

(a)                Prior to the Effective Time, First South shall offer to enter into a Stock Option Cash-Out Agreement in the form of
Exhibit G with each holder of First South Options having an exercise price per share less than the per share value of the Merger
Consideration to cash out their First South Options.

(b)                As of the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall have the right to (i) either assume any options or other stock-
based awards (“First South Options”) substantially in accordance with the terms of the First South Equity Plans and the option grants
or other award agreements by which they are evidenced in accordance with the terms of the First South Equity Plans or (ii) replace the
First South Options with substantially identical awards under any plans sponsored by Carolina Financial under which options and other
stock-based awards are granted, and the award agreements thereunder (each, a “Carolina Financial Stock Plan”), such that after the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any First South Options, the First South Options shall be converted into and
become rights with respect to Carolina Financial Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (A) each First South Option
assumed or replaced by Carolina Financial may be exercised solely for shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock, (B) the number of
shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock subject to such First South Option shall be equal to the number of shares of First South
Common Stock subject to such First South Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole share), and (C) the per share exercise price under each such First South Option shall be adjusted to reflect
the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is intended that the foregoing assumption shall be undertaken in a
manner that will not constitute a “modification” as defined in Section 424 of the Code, as to any stock option which is an “incentive
stock option.” Carolina Financial and First South agree to take all steps necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 3.4(b).

(c)                First South’s Board of Directors and its compensation committee shall not make any grants of First South Options
following the execution of this Agreement.

(d)                To the extent permitted under applicable Law and the terms of the First South Bancorp, Inc. 1997 Stock Option
Plan, as amended, and the First South Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the “First South Equity Plans”), First
South’s Board of Directors or its compensation committee shall make any adjustments and amendments to or make such
determinations with respect to the First South Options necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4.

3.5 Rights of Former First South Shareholders.

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of First South shall be closed as to holders of First South Common Stock and
no transfer of First South Common Stock by any holder of such shares shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, each Certificate or First South Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing
shares of First South Common Stock (other than Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares representing Extinguished Shares), shall
from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as
provided in Article 3.
 

3.6 Fractional Shares.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of First South Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger, who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Carolina Financial Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates or First South Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder), shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Carolina Financial Common Stock multiplied by the Carolina
Financial Average Closing Price. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a shareholder in
respect of any fractional shares.

prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Laws and other applicable Laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing

withdrawn; and neither First South nor any of its officers has received notice from any Regulatory Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, content, form, or manner of filing or submission of such certifications. No First South

(b)                Each of the First South Financial Statements (including, in each case, any related notes) that are contained in First
South Exchange Act Reports, including any First South Exchange Act Reports filed after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act, was, or will be, prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited interim statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act), fairly presented in
accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial position of First South and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, including the fair values of the assets and liabilities shown
therein, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which
were not or are not expected to be material in amount or effect, and were certified to the extent required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(c)                First South’s independent registered public accountants, which have expressed their opinion with respect to the First
South Financial Statements and its Subsidiaries whether or not included in First South’s Exchange Act Reports (including the related

First South within the meaning of Regulation S-X, and (iii) with respect to First South, in compliance with subsections (g) through (l)

(d)                First South maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act, and such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information relating to First South and its Subsidiaries is
made known on a timely basis to First South’s principal executive officer and First South’s principal financial officer.

4.6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

No First South Entity has any Liabilities required under GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet or in the notes
thereto that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a First South Material Adverse Effect, except Liabilities
which are (i) accrued or reserved against in the consolidated balance sheet of First South as of March 31, 2017 as filed with the SEC or
reflected in the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, or (iii) incurred in

None of the First South Entities is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. All material Taxes of
the First South Entities to the extent due and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid. There
are no Liens for any material Taxes (other than a Lien for current real property or ad valorem Taxes not yet due and payable, or for
Taxes being contested in good faith for which adequate reserves are established in the First South Financial Statements) filed of record
on any of the Assets of any of the First South Entities. No written claim has ever been made by any Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction
where any First South Entity does not file a Tax Return that such First South Entity may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction.

(b)                None of the First South Entities has received any written notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection
with any Taxes. There are no ongoing or pending claims, audits, or examinations regarding any Taxes of any First South Entity or the
assets of any First South Entity. No officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any First South Entity expects any Taxing
Authority to assess any additional material Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed. No issue has been raised by a
Taxing Authority in any prior examination of the First South which, by application of the same or similar principles, could be expected
to result in a proposed material deficiency for any subsequent taxable period. None of the First South Entities has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of any Taxes that remain in effect or agreed to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

(c)                Each First South Entity has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the withholding of
Taxes and the payment thereof to Governmental Authorities, including Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection
with amounts paid or owing to any employee or independent contractor, and Taxes required to be withheld and paid pursuant to
Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under foreign Law.

(d)                The unpaid Taxes of each First South Entity (i) did not, as of the most recent fiscal month end, materially exceed the
reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the most recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) for such First South Entity and (ii) do
not materially exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and
practice of the First South Entities in filing their Tax Returns.

(e)                Except as disclosed in Section 4.8(e) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, none of the First South Entities is
a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement and none of the First South Entities has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was First South) or has any Liability for
Taxes of any Person (other than First South or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law, or as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

(f)                 During the five-year period ending on the date hereof, none of the First South Entities was a “distributing
corporation” or a “controlled corporation” as defined in, and in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code.

(g)                None of the First South Entities has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
contract that could obligate it to make any payments, for which a deduction could be disallowed under Section 280G or 162(m) of the
Code, or that would be subject to withholding under Section 4999 of the Code. None of the First South Entities has been or will be
required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any Tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 of the Code or any
comparable provision under state or foreign Tax Laws as a result of transactions or events occurring prior to the Closing. There is no
material taxable income of First South that will be required under applicable tax law to be reported by Carolina Financial for a taxable
period beginning after the date of the Effective Time which taxable income was realized prior to the Closing Date. Any net operating
losses of the First South Entities disclosed in Section 4.8(g) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum are not subject to any
limitation on their use under the provisions of Sections 382 or 269 of the Code or any other provisions of the Code or the Treasury
Regulations dealing with the utilization of net operating losses other than any such limitations as may arise as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a)                First South’s allowance for possible loan or lease losses (the “Allowance”) is, and has been since January 1, 2016, in
material compliance with First South’s methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses as well as the
standards established by applicable Governmental Authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board in all material respects.

(b)                As of the date hereof, all loans, discounts and leases (in which any First South Entity is lessor) reflected on First
South’s Financial Statements were, and with respect to the consolidated balance sheets delivered as of the dates subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement will be as of the dates thereof, (a) at the time and under the circumstances in which made, made for good,
valuable and adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business and, to the Knowledge of First South, are the legal and binding
obligations of the obligors thereof, (b) evidenced by genuine notes, agreements, or other evidences of indebtedness and (c) to the extent
secured, to the Knowledge of First South, have been secured by valid liens and security interests which have been perfected. Accurate

(c)                All securities held by First South or First South Bank, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of First South
included in the First South Financial Statements, are carried in accordance with GAAP, specifically including Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities. Except for pledges to secure public and trust deposits and Federal
Home Loan Bank advances, to the Knowledge of First South, none of the securities reflected in the First South Financial Statements as
of March 31, 2017, and none of the securities since acquired by First South or First South Bank is subject to any restriction, whether
contractual or statutory, which impairs the ability of First South or First South Bank to freely dispose of such security at any time, other

reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are usable in the ordinary course of business consistent with First South’s past practices.

(b)                All Assets which are material to First South’s business, held under leases or subleases by any of the First South

may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought), and to the Knowledge of First South each such Contract is
in full force and effect.

(c)                The First South Entities currently maintain insurance, including bankers’ blanket bonds, with insurers of recognized
financial responsibility in such amounts as management of First South has reasonably determined to be prudent. None of the First
South Entities has received notice from any insurance carrier that (i) any policy of insurance will be canceled or that coverage
thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased,
or (iii) similar coverage will be denied or limited or not extended or renewed with respect to any First South Entity, any act or
occurrence, or that any Asset, officer, director, employee or agent of any First South Entity will not be covered by such insurance or
bond. There are presently no claims for amounts exceeding $50,000 individually or in the aggregate pending under such policies of
insurance or bonds, and no written notices of claims in excess of such amounts have been given by any First South Entity under such
policies. First South has made no claims, and no claims are contemplated to be made, under its directors’ and officers’ errors and
omissions or other insurance or bankers’ blanket bond.

(d)                The Assets of the First South Entities include all material Assets required by First South Entities to operate the
business of the First South Entities as presently conducted. All real and personal property which is material to the business of First
South or First South Bank that is leased or licensed by it is held pursuant to leases or licenses which are valid and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and except that the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought) and, to the Knowledge of First South, such leases and licenses will not terminate or lapse prior to the Effective Time
or thereafter by reason of completion of the Merger. To the Knowledge of First South, all improved real property owned or leased by
First South or First South Bank is in material compliance with all applicable laws, including zoning laws and the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990.

(e)                Each First South Entity has fee simple title to all the real property assets reflected in the First South Financial
Statements as being owned by a First South Entity or acquired after the date thereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of
since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business) (the “First South Realty”), free and clear of all Liens of any nature
whatsoever, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (ii) Liens for real property or ad valorem Taxes not yet delinquent
(or being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established), (iii) easements, rights of way and other
similar encumbrances and matters of record that do not materially adversely affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby as used by a First South Entity on the date hereof or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
properties, as conducted by a First South Entity on the date hereof and (iv) such imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do
not materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties as used on the date hereof.

(f)                 To the Knowledge of First South, the First South Realty and the real property with respect to which a First South
Entity is the lessee (the “First South Leased Real Properties”) are in material compliance with all applicable building, fire, zoning (or
are legal nonconforming uses allowed under applicable zoning ordinances) and other applicable laws, ordinances and regulations and
with all deed restrictions of record, no written notice of any material violation or material alleged violation thereof has been received in
the past three years that has not been resolved, and there are no proposed changes therein that would materially and adversely affect the
First South Realty, the First South Leased Real Properties or their uses. First South has no Knowledge of any proposed or pending
change in the zoning of, or of any proposed or pending condemnation proceeding with respect to, any of the First South Realty or the
First South Leased Real Properties which may materially and adversely affect the First South Realty or the First South Leased Real
Properties or the current use by a First South Entity thereof.

4.11 Intellectual Property.

Each First South Entity owns or has a license to use all of the Intellectual Property used by such First South Entity in the
course of its business, including sufficient rights in each copy possessed by each First South Entity. Each First South Entity is the
owner of or has a license, with the right to sublicense, to any Intellectual Property sold or licensed to a third party by such First South
Entity in connection with such First South Entity’s business operations, and such First South Entity has the right to convey by sale or
license any Intellectual Property so conveyed. To the Knowledge of First South, no First South Entity is in material Default under any
of its Intellectual Property licenses. No proceedings have been instituted, or are pending or to First South’s Knowledge threatened,
which challenge the rights of any First South Entity with respect to Intellectual Property used, sold, or licensed by such First South
Entity in the course of its business, nor has any person claimed or alleged that any First South Entity has misappropriated any rights to
such Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of First South, the conduct of the business of the First South Entities does not infringe
any Intellectual Property of any other person. No First South Entity is obligated to pay any recurring royalties to any Person with
respect to any such Intellectual Property, other than any license or maintenance fees specified in a license agreement with such party.
First South does not have any Contracts with its directors, officers, or employees which require such officer, director, or employee to
assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to a First South Entity and to keep confidential any trade secrets, proprietary data,
customer information, or other business information of a First South Entity, and to First South’s Knowledge, no such officer, director,
or employee is party to any Contract with any Person other than a First South Entity which requires such officer, director or employee
to assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to any Person other than a First South Entity or to keep confidential any trade secrets,
proprietary data, customer information, or other business information of any Person other than a First South Entity. To First South’s
Knowledge, no officer, director, or employee of any First South Entity is party to any confidentiality, nonsolicitation, noncompetition,
or other Contract which restricts or prohibits such officer, director, or employee from engaging in activities competitive with any
Person, including any First South Entity.

or that are reasonably likely to result in, any material liability or obligation of the First South Entities arising under any Environmental

reasonable basis for, or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to, any such proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
remediation by any Governmental Authority or any third party that would give rise to any material liability or obligation on the part of
the First South Entities. None of the First South Entities is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by
or with any Governmental Authority or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any of the foregoing. Each

Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act, and each First South Entity has timely filed all reports of suspicious activity, including
those required under 12 C.F.R. § 353.3.

(vii)            Each First South Entity’s collection and use of individually identifiable personal information (“IIPI”) to an
identifiable or identified natural person complies in all material respects with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act.

4.14 Labor Relations.

(a)                No First South Entity is the subject of any Litigation asserting that it or any other First South Entity has committed
an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or other violation of state or
federal labor Law or seeking to compel it or any other First South Entity to bargain with any labor organization or other employee
representative as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is any First South Entity party to any collective bargaining agreement or
subject to any bargaining order, injunction, or other Order relating to any First South Entity’s relationship or dealings with its
employees, any labor organization or any other employee representative. There is no strike, slowdown, lockout, or other similar job
action or labor dispute involving any First South Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of First South, threatened, and there have been
no such actions or disputes in the past five years. To First South’s Knowledge, there has not been any attempt by any First South Entity
employees or any labor organization or other employee representative to organize or certify a collective bargaining unit or to engage in
any other union organization activity with respect to the workforce of any First South Entity.

(b)                Except as disclosed in Section 4.14(b) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, the employment of each
employee and the engagement of each independent contractor of each First South Entity is terminable at will by the relevant First
South Entity without (i) any penalty, liability, or severance obligation incurred by any First South Entity, (ii) and in all cases without
prior consent by any Governmental Authority. No First South Entity will owe any amounts to any of its employees or independent
contractors as of the Closing Date, including any amounts incurred for wages, bonuses, vacation pay, sick leave, contract notice
periods, change of control payments, or severance obligations that have not been properly accrued for or otherwise recorded in the

(c)                To First South’s Knowledge, all of the employees employed by First South and First South Bank in the United States
are either United States citizens or are legally eligible to work in the United States under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, as amended, other United States immigration Laws and the Laws related to the employment of non-United States citizens

facilities or operating units within a single site of employment of any First South Entity; or (ii) a “mass layoff” (as defined in the
WARN Act) affecting a single site of employment of any First South Entity; and no First South Entity has been affected by any layoffs

contractors of each First South Entity (separately listed by First South Entity) and each such individual meets the standard for an
independent contractor under all Laws (including Treasury Regulations under the Code and federal and state labor and employment
Laws) and no such Person is an employee of any First South Entity under any applicable Law.

(a)                First South has disclosed in Section 4.15(a) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, and has delivered or made
available to Carolina Financial prior to the execution of this Agreement, (i) copies of each Employee Benefit Plan currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed or required to be contributed to by any First South Entity or any ERISA
Affiliate thereof for the benefit of employees, former employees, retirees, directors, independent contractors, or their respective
dependents, spouses, or other beneficiaries or under which employees, retirees, former employees, directors, independent contractors,
or their respective dependents, spouses, or other beneficiaries are eligible to participate (each, a “First South Benefit Plan,” and
collectively, the “First South Benefit Plans”) and (ii) a list of each Employee Benefit Plan that is not identified in (i) above and in
connection with which any First South Entity or any ERISA Affiliate thereof has or reasonably could have any obligation or Liability.

(c)                Each First South Benefit Plan is in material compliance with the terms of such First South Benefit Plan, in material
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Code, in material compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, and in
material compliance with any and all other applicable Laws. Each First South ERISA Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or opinion from the IRS or, in the alternative, appropriately
relies upon a favorable opinion letter or advisory letter issued to a prototype plan or volume submitter under which the First South
ERISA Plan has been adopted and First South is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. First South has not received any communication (written or unwritten) from any Governmental Authority
questioning or challenging the compliance of any First South Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No First South Benefit Plan is
currently being audited by any Governmental Authority for compliance with applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination
by any Governmental Authority that the First South Benefit Plan failed to comply with applicable Laws.

(d)                There has been no material written or, to the First South’s Knowledge, oral representation or communication with
respect to any aspect of the First South Benefit Plans made to employees of the First South which is not in all material respects in
accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans. Neither First South nor, to the Knowledge of
First South, any administrator or fiduciary of any First South Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in any
transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner, which could subject First South or Carolina Financial to any direct or indirect
Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved
claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the First South Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are
payable in the ordinary course of business and no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing, or investigation has been
commenced with respect to any First South Benefit Plan other than routine claims for benefits.

(e)                All First South Benefit Plan documents and annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements,
actuarial valuations, summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to the First South Benefit Plans are
correct and complete in all material respects, and to the extent applicable, have been timely filed with the IRS or the DOL, and
distributed to participants of the First South Benefit Plans (to the extent required by Law), and there have been no material
misstatements or omissions in the information set forth therein.

(f)                 To the First South’s Knowledge, no “Party in Interest” (as defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or “Disqualified Person”
(as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any First South Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt “Prohibited Transaction”
(described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

(g)                No First South Entity nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, or ever has had, any obligation or Liability in connection
with, any plan that is or was subject to Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA.

(h)                No material Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any First South Entity or
any ERISA Affiliate thereof, and no event has occurred that could reasonably result in Liability under Title IV of ERISA being
incurred by any First South Entity or any ERISA Affiliate thereof with respect to any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other single-
employer plan of any First South Entity or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Except as may arise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has been no “reportable event,” within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived by any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other single-employer plan of First
South or of an ERISA Affiliate.

(i)                 Except as required under Part 6 of ERISA or Code Section 4980B, no First South Entity has any material Liability
or obligation for retiree or post-termination of employment or services health or life benefits under any of the First South Benefit Plans,
or other plan or arrangement, and there are no restrictions on the rights of such First South Entity to amend or terminate any and all
such retiree or post-termination of employment or services health or benefit plans or arrangements without incurring any Liability. No
Tax under Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any First South Benefit Plan, or other plan or arrangement,
and no circumstance exists which could give rise to such Taxes.

(j)                 Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(j) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment for or related
to individual services (including severance, unemployment compensation, “excess parachute payment” as defined under Code Section
280G, or otherwise) becoming due from any First South Entity to any employee, officer, director or independent contractor under any
First South Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any First South Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in
any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit, or any benefit under any life insurance owned by any First
South Entity or the rights of any First South Entity in, to or under any insurance on the life of any current or former officer, director, or
employee of any First South Entity, or change any rights or obligations of any First South Entity with respect to such insurance.

(k)                Section 4.15(k) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum sets forth preliminary calculations, based on
assumptions set forth therein, of the following: (i) the amount of all payments and benefits to which each individual set forth on such
First South Disclosure Memorandum is entitled to receive, pursuant to all employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in control,
and all other agreements, plans and arrangements, in connection with a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in
connection with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding
payments or benefits in respect of vested equity awards) (each such total amount in respect of each such individual, the “Change in
Control Benefit”), other than the payment any such individual shall otherwise be entitled to receive as a gross-up payment in respect of
any excise tax imposed on the individual pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code as calculated pursuant to the applicable agreement (any
each such payment, a “Gross-Up Payment”); (ii) the amount of any Gross-Up Payment payable to each such individual; and (iii) the
aggregate amount of all Change in Control Benefits and Gross-Up Payments.

(l)                 No First South Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or related to a “voluntary employee’s
beneficiary association” within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a “welfare benefit fund” within the meaning of Section
419 of the Code, a “qualified asset account” within the meaning of Section 419A of the Code or a “multiple employer welfare
arrangement” within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred compensation
entitlements (including entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of
employees and former employees of any First South Entity and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant
to funded retirement plans, whether or not subject to the provisions of Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, have been fully
reflected on the First South Financial Statements in all material respects to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

(m)              Each First South Benefit Plan that is a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” (within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code) has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS with respect to
such plans or is not required to comply therewith due to its grandfathered status under Section 409A of the Code.

(n)                All individuals who render services to any First South Entity and who are authorized to participate in a First South
Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms of such First South Benefit Plan are in fact eligible to and authorized to participate in such First
South Benefit Plan. All First South Entities have, for purposes of the First South Benefit Plans and all other purposes, correctly
classified all individuals performing services for such First South Entity as common law employees, independent contractors or agents,
as applicable.

(o)                Neither the First South nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had an “obligation to contribute” (as defined in ERISA
Section 4212) to, or other obligations or Liability in connection with, a “multiemployer plan” (as defined in ERISA Sections 4001(a)
(3) or 3(37)(A)) or any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2) that is subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA or a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or ERISA Sections 4063,
4064 or 4066.

(p)                There are no payments or changes in terms due to any insured person as a result of this Agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated herein, under any bank-owned, corporate-owned split dollar life insurance, other life insurance, or
similar arrangement or Contract, and the Successor Corporation shall, upon and after the Effective Time, succeed to and have all the
rights in, to and under such life insurance Contracts as First South presently holds. Each First South Entity will, upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and will continue to have, notwithstanding this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby, all ownership rights and interest in all corporate or bank-owned life insurance.

(q)                Each First South ERISA Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code so qualifies, and its
related trust is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, and no event has occurred and no condition exists that could reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualified or tax exempt status.

(r)                 Each First South Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated by First South without the consent of any Person.

(s)                 Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(t) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, no First South Benefit Plan that
is described in ERISA Section 3(2) is involved or connected with any fund or other investment that has or involves any early
termination, market value adjustment or other similar fee, payment requirement, or other charge.

(t)                 Other than agreements identified in Section 4.16(a) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, no First South
Benefit Plan, or other plan or arrangement, is subject to any requirement of Section 409A(a)(2), (3), or (4) of the Code.

(u)                Other than the First South Benefit Plans identified in Section 4.15(a) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, no
First South Benefit Plan provides for the potential issuance of equity compensation.

(v)                No event has occurred or condition exists that could subject the First South or any of its ERISA Affiliates to
Liability (whether direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise) on account of a violation of the health care requirements of Part 6 or 7 of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B or 4980D of the Code.

(w)              Each group health plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the First South or any of its ERISA Affiliates (or
to which the First South or any of its ERISA Affiliates is obligated to contribute or otherwise has any liability or contingent liability)
satisfies the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the regulations and guidance issued thereunder
(“PPACA”), such that there is no Tax or penalty that could be imposed pursuant to the PPACA that relates to such group health plan.
No condition exists that could cause the First South or any of its ERISA Affiliates to incur Liability for any assessable payment under
Section 4980H of the Code.

4.16 Material Contracts.

(a)                Except as reflected in the First South Financial Statements, disclosed in First South Exchange Act Reports or

$100,000. All of the indebtedness of any First South Entity for money borrowed (other than deposit liabilities, purchases of federal
funds, advances from the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank, repurchase agreements fully secured by U.S. government
securities or U.S. government agency securities, advances of depository institution Subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of First

Except as disclosed in Section 4.18 of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, there is no Litigation instituted or pending, or,
to the Knowledge of First South, threatened (or unasserted but considered probable of assertion) against any First South Entity, or to
First South’s Knowledge, against any director, officer, employee, or agent of any First South Entity in their capacities as such or with
respect to any service to or on behalf of any First South Benefit Plan or any other Person at the request of the First South Entity or First
South Benefit Plan, or against any Asset, interest, or right of any of them, nor are there any Orders or judgments outstanding against

4.19 Reports.

Except for immaterial late filings, since December 31, 2013, each First South Entity has timely filed all reports and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with Governmental
Authorities. As of their respective dates, each of such reports and documents, including the financial statements, exhibits, and
schedules thereto, complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws. As of their respective dates, such reports and documents
did not, in all material respects, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

4.20 Internal Control.

First South’s internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
First South’s financial reporting and the preparation of First South financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
First South’s internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding the maintenance of
records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of First South’s consolidated Assets; (ii)
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of First South’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP and
that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of ’s management and directors; and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of First South’s consolidated Assets that could
have a material impact on First South’s financial statements.

 
4.21 Loans to, and Transactions with, Executive Officers and Directors.

No First South Entity has, since December 31, 2013, extended or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or
renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer (or equivalent thereof) of any
First South Entity, except as permitted by Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act and Federal Reserve Regulation O. Section 4.21 of the
First South Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a list of all Loans as of the date hereof by the First South Entities to any directors,
executive officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are defined in Regulation O of the Federal Reserve (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of
First South or any First South Entity. There are no employee, officer, director or other affiliate Loans on which the borrower is paying a
rate other than that reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which
was below market rate for similar loans to similarly situated borrowers at the time the Loan was originated. All such Loans are and
were originated in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws. No director or executive officer of First South or any
First South Entity, or any “associate” (as such term is defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act) or related interest of any such
Person, has any interest in any contract or property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), used in, or pertaining to, the business of
First South or any First South Entity.

4.22 Approvals.

No First South Entity nor, to the Knowledge of First South, any Affiliate thereof, has taken or agreed to take any action or has
any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to materially impede or delay receipt of any required Consents or
result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred to in the last sentence of Section 8.1(b). No First South Entity is
subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any
order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil penalty by, or is a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or has adopted any

ARTICLE 7  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

7.1 Shareholder Approvals.

(a)                Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, First South shall submit to its shareholders
this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In
furtherance of that obligation, First South shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene, and hold First South’s Shareholders’ Meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable. The First South Board shall recommend that its shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance with the VSCA (the
“First South Recommendation”) and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, except to the extent
the First South’s Board has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 7.1(b) and 7.3, First South shall solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Requisite First South Shareholder Vote.

(b)                Neither First South’s Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.1(b), (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Carolina Financial, the First
South Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each,
an “Adverse Recommendation Change”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Requisite First South Shareholder Vote, the First
South’s Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if and only if (A) a material development or material change in
circumstance occurs, arises or becomes known to First South’s Board after the date of this Agreement unrelated to any potential or
actual Acquisition Proposal (such material development or change in circumstances being referred to as an “Intervening Event”) and
First South’s Board determines in good faith, after consultation with First South’s outside counsel, that in light of such Intervening
Event an Adverse Recommendation Change is required in order for First South’s Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to First
South’s shareholders under applicable Law, or (B):

(i)                 First South’s Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the First South Financial Advisor and
outside counsel, that it has received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of Section 7.3) that is a Superior
Proposal;

(ii)               First South’s Board determines in good faith, after consultation with First South’s outside counsel, that a
failure to accept such Superior Proposal would result in First South’s Board breaching its fiduciary duties to First South and
its shareholders under applicable Law;

(iii)             First South’s Board provides written notice (a “Notice of Recommendation Change”) to Carolina Financial
of its receipt of the Superior Proposal and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on the fifth business
day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
(and include a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing) and identify the Person or Group making
such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the five business day period referred to in this
clause (iii) and in clauses (iv) and (v) shall be reduced to three business days following the giving of such new Notice of
Recommendation Change);

 40  



9/17/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1027183/000114420417046800/v474648_defm14a.htm

(iv)              after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, First South shall negotiate in good faith with
Carolina Financial (if requested by Carolina Financial) and provide Carolina Financial reasonable opportunity during the
subsequent five business day period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
the First South Board to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change (provided, however, that Carolina Financial
shall not be required to propose any such adjustments); and

(v)                First South’s Board, following such five business day period, again determines in good faith, after
consultation with the First South Financial Advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would violate their fiduciary duties to First South and its
shareholders under applicable Law.

(c)                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except to the extent prohibited by the VSCA as determined
by First South after consultation with First South’s outside counsel, First South shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the
First South’s Shareholders’ Meeting even if First South’s Board has made an Adverse Recommendation Change, in which case the
First South’s Board may communicate the Adverse Recommendation Change and the basis for it to the shareholders of First South in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any appropriate amendment or supplement thereto; provided, however, that First South may
postpone or adjourn First South’s Shareholders’ Meeting: (i) with the consent of Carolina Financial; (ii) for the absence of a quorum;
(iii) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided
to the shareholders of First South within a reasonable period of time in advance of First South’s Shareholders’ Meeting; (iv) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies; (v) if required by applicable Law; or (vi) if First South has provided a Notice of
Recommendation Change to Carolina Financial pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) and the notice period contemplated by Section 7.1(b)(iii)
has not yet expired.

(d)                Carolina Financial shall submit to its stockholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by
its stockholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement, including the issuance of the Merger Consideration. In
furtherance of that obligation, Carolina Financial shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene, and hold Carolina Financial’s Stockholders’ Meeting as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Carolina Financial Board shall recommend that its stockholders approve this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL and approve the issuance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ
Stock Market and shall include such recommendations in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Carolina Financial shall solicit and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Carolina Financial Stockholder Votes.

7.2 Securities Act Compliance.

(a)                As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Carolina Financial shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement, which shall include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and constitute the prospectus relating to the
shares of Carolina Financial Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. First South will furnish to Carolina Financial the information
required to be included in the Registration Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to review and
consult with Carolina Financial on the form of, and any characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement
prior to its being filed with the SEC. Carolina Financial shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Carolina Financial and First South will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Carolina Financial will advise First South, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Carolina Financial Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Carolina Financial or First South, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Carolina Financial or First South which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by Carolina Financial with the SEC and disseminated by First South to its shareholders and by
Carolina Financial to its stockholders.

(b)                Carolina Financial shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in

(a)                From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement,
each First South Entity shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit or initiate, or
knowingly encourage, induce or knowingly facilitate the making, submission, or announcement of any proposal that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions (except to notify a third party of the existence of restrictions provided in this

confidentiality agreement of the type described below) (an “Acquisition Agreement”) contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that prior to the Requisite First South
Shareholder Vote, this Section 7.3 shall not prohibit a First South Entity from furnishing nonpublic information regarding any First
South Entity to, or entering into a confidentiality agreement or discussions or negotiations with, any Person or Group in response to a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or Group (and not withdrawn) if and only if: (A) no First
South Entity or Representative or Affiliate thereof shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3 (other than any
breach of such obligation that is unintentional and immaterial and did not result in the submission of such Acquisition Proposal), (B)
First South’s Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the First South Financial Advisor and First South’s
outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (C) First
South’s Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be

intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person or Group, and (2) First South
receives from such Person or Group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the disclosing Party
than the confidentiality terms of this Agreement, and (E) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person or Group, First South furnishes such nonpublic information to Carolina Financial (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously furnished by First South to Carolina Financial). In addition to the foregoing, First South shall provide Carolina
Financial with at least two business days’ prior written notice of a meeting of First South’s Board at which meeting First South’s Board
is reasonably expected to resolve to recommend the Acquisition Agreement as a Superior Proposal to its shareholders, and First South
shall keep Carolina Financial reasonably informed on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.

(b)                In addition to the obligations of First South set forth in this Section 7.3, as promptly as practicable, after any of the
directors or executive officers of First South become aware thereof, First South shall advise Carolina Financial of any request received
by First South for nonpublic information which First South reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person or
Group making any such request or Acquisition Proposal. First South shall keep Carolina Financial informed promptly of material
amendments or modifications to any such request or Acquisition Proposal.

(c)                First South shall, and shall cause its and each First South Entity’s directors, officers, employees, and Representatives
to immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and will use and cause to be used all commercially reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar or related agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d)                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its Board of Directors from (i) complying with Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided, however, that such Rule will in no way eliminate or
modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rule would otherwise have under this Agreement; (ii) making any disclosure to First
South’s shareholders if First South’s Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law, (iii) informing any Person of the existence of
the provisions contained in this Section 7.3 or (iv) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to First South’s shareholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to First South’s shareholders).

practicable all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). The Parties agree that they will consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. Each Party also shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any
communication from any Regulatory Authority or other Person whose Consent is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Consent will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.

7.5 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order
adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to
in Article 8; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this Agreement.

 
7.6 Investigation and Confidentiality.

(a)                Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall keep the other Party advised of all material developments relevant to its
business and the consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such investigation of its
business and properties (including that of its Subsidiaries) and of their respective financial and legal conditions as the other Party
reasonably requests, provided, that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily or materially with normal operations. No investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on
the representations and warranties of the other Party. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, First South shall permit Carolina
Financial’s senior officers and independent accountants to meet with the senior officers of First South, including officers responsible
for the First South Financial Statements, the internal controls of First South, and the disclosure controls and procedures of First South
and First South’s independent public accountants, to discuss such matters as Carolina Financial may deem reasonably necessary or
appropriate for Carolina Financial to satisfy its obligations under Sections 302, 404 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(b)                In addition to each Party’s obligations pursuant to Section 7.6(a), each Party shall, and shall cause its advisors and
agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its and its
Subsidiaries’ businesses, operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except in furtherance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly
return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information received
from the other Party.

(c)                First South shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to exercise, and shall not waive any of, its rights under
confidentiality agreements entered into with Persons which were considering an Acquisition Proposal with respect to First South to
preserve the confidentiality of the information relating to the First South Entities provided to such Persons and their Affiliates and
Representatives.

(d)                Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as practicable after any determination by it of any fact or
occurrence relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the course of its investigation and which represents, or is
reasonably likely to represent, either a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party or
which has had or is reasonably likely to have a First South Material Adverse Effect or a Carolina Financial Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

(e)                Each Carolina Financial Entity shall, in accordance with Carolina Financial’s comprehensive written data security
program established and maintained pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 6801 and regulations promulgated thereunder (“Carolina Financial
Security Program”), safeguard IIPI disclosed to that Carolina Financial Entity pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any Carolina Financial Entity allows a third party to access such IIPI, Carolina
Financial shall ensure that the third party safeguards that IIPI in accordance with a data security program substantially equivalent to the
Carolina Financial Security Program.

(f)                 Carolina Financial shall notify First South promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) of any Data Incident. All
Carolina Financial Entities shall promptly take all actions that are necessary and advisable to correct, mitigate, and prevent recurrence
of the Data Incident. All Carolina Financial Entities shall cooperate fully with First South and its designees in all reasonable efforts to
investigate the Data Incident.

(g)                If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Carolina Financial Entity shall promptly return or
dispose of, and certify the return or disposal, of all IIPI received by the Carolina Financial Entity in connection with this Agreement.
Any disposal of such IIPI must be performed in a manner that ensures that the IIPI is rendered permanently unreadable and
unrecoverable.

7.7 Press Releases.

Prior to the Effective Time, First South and Carolina Financial shall consult with each other as to the form and substance of
any press release, communication with First South’s shareholders, or other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement, or
any other transaction contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party
from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Party’s disclosure obligations
imposed by Law.

 
7.8 Charter Provisions.

Each First South Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under
the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, or other governing instruments of any First South Entity or restrict or impair the ability of
Carolina Financial or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a shareholder with respect to, shares of any
First South Entity that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by them.

 
7.9 Employee Benefits and Contracts.

(a)                Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, all persons who are employees of the First South Entities
immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment is not terminated, if any, at or prior to the Effective Time (a
“Continuing Employee”) shall, at the Effective Time, become at-will employees of the Surviving Bank or one of its subsidiaries;
provided, however, that in no event shall any of the employees of the First South Entities be officers of the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Bank, or have or exercise any power or duty conferred upon such an officer, unless and until duly elected or appointed to
such position by the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank and in accordance with the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank. All of the Continuing Employees shall be employed at the will of the Surviving Bank,
and no contractual right to employment shall inure to such employees because of this Agreement except as may be otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement.

(b)                As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in each of Carolina Financial’s
Employee Benefit Plans with full credit for prior service with First South and any other First South Entity solely for purposes of
eligibility and vesting, except that such service shall also be credited for purposes of calculating benefits under Carolina Financial’s
standard severance policy. For the avoidance of doubt, each Continuing Employee who is terminated involuntarily other than for cause
(as determined by the Carolina Financial) will be eligible to receive severance benefits under Carolina Financial’s standard severance
policy for its employees, an accurate and complete description of which has been provided to First South, in addition to outplacement
assistance; provided, however, that any Continuing Employees who are eligible to receive severance benefits, change of control
benefits or any payments that are enhanced on account of the Merger pursuant to an individual employment arrangement, change of
control arrangement or deferred compensation plan other than any Retention Bonus Agreement shall not be eligible to receive
severance benefits under Carolina Financial’s standard severance policy.

(c)                As of the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall make available employer-provided benefits under Carolina
Financial Employee Benefit Plans to each Continuing Employee on the same basis as it provides such coverage to Carolina Financial
or CresCom Bank employees. With respect to Carolina Financial Employee Benefit Plans providing health coverage, Carolina
Financial shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or other limitations
or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new employees not to apply to a Continuing Employee or their covered
dependents who were covered under a similar First South plan at the Effective Time of the Merger. In addition, if any such transition
occurs during the middle of a plan year, Carolina Financial shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such successor
Carolina Financial Employee Benefit Plan providing health coverage to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible
limitation and out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any deductible, co-payment and other cost-sharing
amounts previously paid by a Continuing Employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding First South Employee
Benefit Plan during that plan year prior to the transition effective date.

(d)                First South shall cause each of First South’s directors who are not employees of First South or First South Bank to
execute and deliver a Non-Employee Director Non-Competition Agreement dated as of the date hereof (and which shall be effective as
of the Effective Time) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B

(e)                Except as disclosed in Section 7.9 of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, First South shall cause each of First
South’s Executive Officers and directors to execute and deliver a Shareholder Support Agreement dated as of the date hereof in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C pursuant to which he or she will vote his or her shares of First South Common Stock in favor of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f)                 No officer, employee, or other Person (other than the corporate Parties to this Agreement) shall be deemed a third
party or other beneficiary of this Agreement, and no such Person shall have any right or other entitlement to enforce any provision of
this Agreement or seek any remedy in connection with this Agreement, except as may be expressly set forth in Section 7.11. No
provision of this Agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute, an employee benefit plan or other arrangement, an amendment
of any employee benefit plan or other arrangement, or any provision of any employee benefit plan or other arrangement.

(g)                First South shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the employees designated by Carolina Financial to execute a
CresCom Merger / Cash Retention Bonus Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.

(h)                Consistent with applicable Law, First South shall notify each holder of First South Options having an exercise price
per share less than the per share value of the Merger Consideration of such optionee’s right to enter into a Stock Option Cash-Out
Agreement in the form of Exhibit G.

(i)                 Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Bruce W. Elder and
Cornelius F. Sullivan shall enter into employment agreements in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits H and I, respectively, which
shall become effective only upon the effective time of the Merger.

(j)                 Upon not less than 10 days’ notice prior to the Closing Date from Carolina Financial to First South, First South shall
cause the adoption of resolutions (which are acceptable to Carolina Financial) by each applicable First South Entity’s Board of
Directors terminating, amending or causing other appropriate modification of each First South Benefit Plan as specified by Carolina
Financial in such notice, effective as of the date which immediately precedes the Closing Date or as of the Closing Date (as shall be
specified in such notice), provided that (a) First South shall be required to take such action only with respect to First South Benefit
Plans that may unilaterally be terminated, amended or modified, as applicable, as requested by Carolina Financial, by a First South
Entity in accordance with the terms of the plan and applicable Law, (b) First South shall not be required to take such action if and to the
extent it would cause a plan participant to be denied a benefit, or vesting of a benefit, that the participant would have been entitled to
under the plan if the plan had not been so terminated, amended or modified at or prior to the Effective Time; and (c) for the avoidance
of doubt, any reasonable costs or expenses that are incurred by a First South Entity in connection with such termination, amendment or
modification (including without limitation the payment of any benefits or compensation) shall be considered reasonable expenses
incurred by a First South Entity in connection with the Merger. Upon such action, participants in such applicable First South Benefit
Plans that are First South ERISA Plans shall be 100% vested in their account balances or other applicable plan benefits.

7.10 Section 16 Matters.

Prior to the Effective Time, First South and Carolina Financial shall take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the
case of First South) any dispositions of First South Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to First South Common
Stock) by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to First South
(“First South Insiders”) or (in the case of Carolina Financial) any acquisitions of Carolina Financial Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Carolina Financial Common Stock) by any First South Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Carolina Financial, in each
case resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. First South agrees to promptly furnish Carolina Financial
with all requisite information necessary for Carolina Financial to take the actions contemplated by this Section 7.10.

7.11 Indemnification.

(a)                Carolina Financial shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the present and former directors and executive
officers of the First South Entities (each, an “Indemnified Party”) against all Liabilities arising out of actions or omissions arising out
of the Indemnified Party’s service or services as directors, officers, employees, or agents of a First South Entity or, at First South’s
request, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including service in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL,
the VSCA, Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Securities Laws and FDIC Regulations Part 359, and by the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of First South and any other First South Entity as in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to
advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation and whether or not any First South Entity is insured against any such
matter.

(b)                Prior to the Effective Time, Carolina Financial shall purchase, or shall direct First South to purchase, an extended
reporting period endorsement under First South’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage (“First South Entities’
D&O Policies”) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time by such directors and officers currently covered by First
South Entities’ D&O Policies. The directors and officers of First South shall take all reasonable actions required by the insurance
carrier necessary to procure such endorsement. Such endorsement shall provide such directors and officers with coverage (including
bankers’ professional liability, cyber and employment practices coverage) following the Effective Time for six years or such lesser
period of time as can be purchased for an aggregate amount equal to 200% of the current annual premiums for the First South Entities’
D&O Policies (the “Premium Multiple”). If Carolina Financial is unable to obtain or maintain the insurance coverage called for in this
Section 7.11(b), then Carolina Financial shall obtain the most advantageous coverage that can be purchased for the Premium Multiple.

(c)                Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 7.11, upon learning of
any such Liability or Litigation, shall promptly notify Carolina Financial and the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing. In the event
of any such Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Carolina Financial or the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Carolina Financial nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Carolina Financial or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Carolina Financial
or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Carolina
Financial or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly
as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Carolina Financial and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in good faith in the defense of any such Litigation; and (iii) neither Carolina Financial nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and which does not provide for a complete and
irrevocable release of all Carolina Financial’s Entities and their respective directors, officers, and controlling persons, employees,
agents, and Representatives; and provided, further, that neither Carolina Financial nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

(d)                If Carolina Financial or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any Person,
then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Carolina Financial or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.11.

(e)                The provisions of this Section 7.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, shall be enforceable by, and may not be
modified without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and legal and personal representatives.

7.12           Tax Covenants of Carolina Financial.
 

At and after the Effective Time, Carolina Financial covenants and agrees that it:

(a)                will not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization

(b)                will maintain all books and records and prepare and file all federal, state and local income Tax Returns and

state or local Tax Laws);
 

(c)                will, either directly or through a member of Carolina Financial’s Qualified Group, continue at least one significant
historic business line of First South, or use at least a significant portion of the historic business assets of First South in a business, in
each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d);
 

(d)                in connection with the Merger, will not reacquire, and will not permit any Person that is a “related person” (as

issued in connection with the Merger; and
 

(e)                will not sell or otherwise dispose of any of First South’s assets acquired in the Merger, and will not cause or permit
CresCom Bank to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Bank’s assets acquired in the Bank Merger, except for dispositions made in
the ordinary course of business or transfers described in Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or described and permitted in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(k).

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be conditioned or restricted in a manner (including requirements relating to the
raising of additional capital or the disposition of Assets) which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of Carolina

Merger (other than those referred to in Section 8.1(b)) or for the preventing of any Default under any Contract or Permit of such Party

Effect or a Carolina Financial Material Adverse Effect, as applicable. First South shall have obtained the Consents listed in Section
8.1(c) of the First South Disclosure Memorandum, including Consents from the lessors of each office leased by First South, if any. No
Consent so obtained which is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be conditioned or restricted in a
manner which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of Carolina Financial would so materially adversely affect the
economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that, had such condition or requirement been known,
Carolina Financial would not, in its reasonable judgment, have entered into this Agreement.

(d)                Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall have been declared effective by the SEC, and no
proceedings shall be pending or threatened by the SEC to suspend the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

(g)                Tax Opinion. Carolina Financial and First South shall have received the opinion of Carolina Financial’s legal
counsel, dated as of the Closing, in form and substance customary in transactions of the type contemplated hereby, substantially to the
effect that on the basis of the facts, representations, and assumptions set forth in such opinion, which are consistent with the state of
facts existing at the Effective Time, (i) the Merger will be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) Carolina Financial and First South will each be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. Such opinion may be based on, in addition to the review of such matters of fact and Law as the
opinion given considers appropriate, representations contained in certificates of officers of Carolina Financial and First South.

Annex B
 

Opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

June 9, 2017
 

 
The Board of Directors
Carolina Financial Corporation
288 Meeting Street
Charleston, South Carolina 29401
 
Members of the Board:

 
You have requested the opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW” or “we”) as investment bankers as to the fairness,

from a financial point of view, to Carolina Financial Corporation (“Carolina”) of the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) in the
proposed merger (the “Merger”) of First South Bancorp, Inc. (“First South”) with and into Carolina, pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Agreement”) to be entered into by and between Carolina and First South. Pursuant to the
Agreement and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth therein, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Carolina or First South, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of First South (“First South Common Stock”) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Extinguished Shares (as defined in the Agreement)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.52 of a share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Carolina (“Carolina Common Stock”), subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement (as to which
we express no opinion). The ratio of 0.52 of a share of Carolina Common Stock for one share of First South Common Stock is referred
to herein as the “Exchange Ratio.” The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

 
The Agreement further provides that, simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective Time, and pursuant to a

separate bank agreement of merger, First South Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First South, will merge with and into CresCom
Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Carolina, with CresCom Bank as the surviving entity (such transaction, the “Bank Merger”).

 
KBW has acted as financial advisor to Carolina and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our

investment banking business, we are continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection
with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of, the
valuation of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of our and their broker-dealer businesses, we and our affiliates may from time
to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Carolina and First South. In addition, as a market maker in securities, we and
our affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Carolina or First South
for our and their own respective accounts and for the accounts of our and their respective customers and clients. We have acted
exclusively for the board of directors of Carolina (the “Board”) in rendering this opinion and will receive a fee from Carolina for our
services. A portion of our fee is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a significant portion is contingent upon the successful
completion of the Merger. In addition, Carolina has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

The Board of Directors – Carolina Financial Corporation

In addition to this present engagement, in the past two years KBW has provided investment banking and financial advisory
services to Carolina for which compensation was received. KBW acted as financial advisor to Carolina in connection with its March
2017 acquisition of Greer Bancshares Incorporated. In addition, KBW acted as an underwriter in connection with each of Carolina’s
January 2017 and December 2015 registered offerings of Carolina Common Stock. In the past two years, KBW has not provided
investment banking and financial advisory services to First South. We may in the future provide investment banking and financial
advisory services to Carolina or First South and receive compensation for such services.

 
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating

condition of Carolina and First South and bearing upon the Merger, including among other things, the following: (i) a draft of the
Agreement dated June 8, 2017 (the most recent draft made available to us); (ii) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports
on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of Carolina; (iii) the unaudited quarterly financial statements and the
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 of Carolina; (iv) the audited financial statements and the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of First South; (v) the unaudited quarterly financial
statements and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 of First South; (vi) certain regulatory
filings of Carolina and First South and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FRY-9C and quarterly call
reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended December 31, 2016 and the quarter ended March 31, 2017;
(vii) certain other interim reports and other communications of Carolina and First South to their respective stockholders; and (viii)
other financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Carolina and First South that was furnished to us by
Carolina and First South or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of our analysis. Our consideration of financial
information and other factors that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our analyses included, among others,
the following: (i) the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Carolina and First South; (ii) the assets and
liabilities of Carolina and First South; (iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the
banking industry; (iv) a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Carolina and First South with similar
information for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; (v) financial and operating forecasts and
projections of First South with respect to the 2017 fiscal year that were prepared by, and provided to us and discussed with us by, First
South management and that were used and relied upon by us based on such discussions, at the direction of Carolina management and
with the consent of the Board; (vi) financial and operating forecasts and projections of First South with respect to the period from the
2018 fiscal year through the 2020 fiscal year that were prepared by Carolina management, as well as assumed First South long-term
growth rates with respect to periods thereafter, all of which information was provided to us and discussed with us by Carolina
management and used and relied upon by us at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Board; (vii) the publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of Carolina, as well as assumed Carolina long-term growth rates provided to us by Carolina
management, all of which information was discussed with us by such management and used and relied upon by us at the direction of
such management and with the consent of the Board; and (viii) estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Merger on
Carolina (including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the Merger) that were
prepared by Carolina management, provided to and discussed with us by such management, and used and relied upon by us at the
direction of such management and with the consent of the Board. We have also performed such other studies and analyses as we
considered appropriate and have taken into account our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our
experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. We
have also participated in discussions that were held by the managements of Carolina and First South regarding the past and current
business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies and such other matters
as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.

In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial and other information provided to us or that was publicly available and we have not independently verified the
accuracy or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or
completeness. We have relied upon the management of First South, with the consent of Carolina, as to the reasonableness and
achievability of the financial and operating forecasts and projections of First South with respect to the 2017 fiscal year referred to
above (and the assumptions and bases therefor), and we have assumed that such forecasts and projections were reasonably prepared
and represent the best currently available estimates and judgments of First South management with respect to such fiscal year and that
such forecasts and projections will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated by such management. In
addition, we have relied upon the management of Carolina as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating
forecasts and projections of First South with respect to the period from the 2018 fiscal year through the 2020 fiscal year, as well as
assumed First South long-term growth rates with respect to periods thereafter, all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases
for all such information) and we have assumed that all such information was reasonably prepared and represents the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Carolina management and that the forecasts, projections and estimates contained in such
information will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated by such management. We have further relied
upon the management of Carolina as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of
Carolina, the assumed Carolina long-term growth rates and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Merger on
Carolina (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the Merger) referred
to above and the assumptions set forth in and the bases for such information. We have assumed, at the direction of Carolina, that all
such information was reasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of
Carolina referred to above that such estimates are consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Carolina
management, and that the forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information will be realized in the amounts and in the
time periods currently estimated.

It is understood that the forecasts, projections and estimates of Carolina and First South that were provided to and discussed
with us were not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all such forecasts, projections and estimates, together with the
publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Carolina referred to above, are based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that,
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed, based on discussions
with the respective managements of Carolina and First South and with the consent of the Board, that all such information provides a
reasonable basis upon which we could form our opinion and we express no view as to any such information or the assumptions or
bases therefor. We have relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in any respect assume
any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

 
We also have assumed that there have been no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of

operations, business or prospects of either Carolina or First South since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that
were made available to us and that we were directed to use. We are not experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of
allowances for loan and lease losses and we have assumed, without independent verification and with your consent, that the aggregate
allowances for loan and lease losses for each of Carolina and First South are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering our opinion,
we have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Carolina or First South, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor
have we examined any individual loan or credit files, nor did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Carolina or
First South under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of
companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold.
Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, we assume no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

 
We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Merger and any related transactions

(including the Bank Merger) will be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of
which we have assumed will not differ in any respect material to our analyses from the draft version reviewed by us and referred to
above), with no adjustments to the Exchange Ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of First South Common
Stock; (ii) that the representations and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred
to in the Agreement are true and correct; (iii) that each party to the Agreement or any of the related documents will perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party under such documents; (iv) that there are no factors that would delay
or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the Merger or any related transaction
(including the Bank Merger) and that all conditions to the completion of the Merger and any such related transaction will be satisfied
without any waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and (v) that in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Merger and any related transactions (including the Bank
Merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, will
be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Carolina, First South, the
pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the Merger, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses
expected to result or be derived from the Merger. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all
other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further been advised by representatives of Carolina that
Carolina has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax,
accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Carolina, First South, the Merger and any related transaction (including the Bank
Merger), and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to any such matters.

Opinion of Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

June 9, 2017
 
 
Board of Directors
First South Bancorp, Inc.
1311 Carolina Avenue
Washington, NC 27889
 
 
Members of the Board of Directors:
 
We understand that Carolina Financial Corporation (“Carolina Financial”) and First South Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) propose to
enter into the Agreement (defined below) pursuant to which, among other things, the Company shall be merged with and into Carolina
Financial (the “Transaction”) and that, in connection with the Transaction, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company, except for shares owned by the Company, Carolina Financial, or their respective Subsidiaries
(in each case other than shares of the Company’s common stock held on behalf of third parties or as a result of debts previously
contracted) (the “Common Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive 0.5200 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Carolina
Financial common stock. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested that Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
(“Raymond James”) provide an opinion (the “Opinion”) to the Board as to whether, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio to be
received by the holders of the Common Shares in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders.
 
In connection with our review of the proposed Transaction and the preparation of this Opinion, we have, among other things:
 

1. reviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization by
and between Carolina Financial Corporation and First South Bancorp, Inc. dated as of June 9, 2017 (the “Agreement”);

 
2. reviewed certain information related to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of the

Company made available to us by the Company, including, but not limited to, financial projections prepared by the
management of the Company relating to the Company for the period ending December 31, 2022, as approved for our use by
the Company (the “Projections”);

 
3. reviewed the Company’s and Carolina Financial’s recent public filings and certain other publicly available information

regarding the Company and Carolina Financial;
 
4. reviewed financial, operating and other information regarding the Company and Carolina Financial and the industry in which

they operate;
 

5. reviewed the financial and operating performance of the Company and those of other selected public companies that we
deemed to be relevant;

6. considered the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions we deemed to be relevant;

 
7. reviewed the current and historical market prices and trading volume for the Common Shares, and the current market prices of

the publicly traded securities of certain other companies that we deemed to be relevant;
 

8. conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as we deemed
appropriate; and

 
9. discussed with members of the senior management of the Company certain information relating to the aforementioned and any

other matters which we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.
 
With your consent, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, and we have undertaken no duty or responsibility to, nor did we,
independently verify any of such information. We have not made or obtained an independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company. We are not experts in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing
the adequacy of the allowances for loan losses; accordingly, we have assumed that such allowances for losses are in the aggregate
adequate to cover such losses. With respect to the Projections and any other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by
or discussed with us, we have, with your consent, assumed that the Projections and such other information and data have been
reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the
Company, and we have relied upon the Company to advise us promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or
was required to be updated during the period of our review. We express no opinion with respect to the Projections or the assumptions
on which they are based. We have assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially similar to the draft reviewed by
us, and that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver or amendment of any
conditions thereto and without adjustment to the Exchange Ratio. Furthermore, we have assumed, in all respects material to our
analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Agreement are true and correct and that each such party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement without being waived. We have
relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies in
all respects with all applicable international, federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that no delay, limitations,
restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an effect on the Transaction
or the Company that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion.

We have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company’s management and its legal, tax, accounting and
regulatory advisors with respect to all legal, tax, accounting and regulatory matters, including without limitation that the Transaction
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.
 
Our opinion is based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to us as of June
8, 2017 and any material change in such circumstances and conditions would require a reevaluation of this Opinion, which we are
under no obligation to undertake. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there has been no change in
the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the Company since the respective
dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our
analyses or this Opinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us
incomplete or misleading in any material respect.
 
We express no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the Transaction, the structure or tax consequences of the
Transaction or the availability or advisability of any alternatives to the Transaction. We provided advice to the Board with respect to
the proposed Transaction. We did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration or that any specific consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction. This letter does not express any opinion as to the likely trading range
of Carolina Financial common stock following the Transaction, which may vary depending on numerous factors that generally impact
the price of securities or on the financial condition of Carolina Financial at that time. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of the Common Shares.
 
We express no opinion with respect to any other reasons, legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the Board to
approve or consummate the Transaction. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation is intended by Raymond James on matters
that require legal, accounting or tax advice. It is assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations have been or will be obtained
from the appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, we have relied, with the consent of the Board, on the fact that the Company
has been assisted by legal, accounting, tax and regulatory advisors and we have, with the consent of the Board, relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of the assessments by the Company and its advisors as to all legal, accounting, tax and
regulatory matters with respect to the Company and the Transaction.

In formulating our opinion, we have considered only what we understand to be the consideration to be received by the holders of
Common Shares as is described above and we did not consider and we express no opinion on the fairness of the amount or nature of
any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, whether
relative to the compensation received by the holders of the Common Shares or otherwise. We have not been requested to opine as to,
and this Opinion does not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the Transaction to the
holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company, or to any other party, except and only to the extent
expressly set forth in the last sentence of this Opinion or (2) the fairness of the Transaction to any one class or group of the Company’s,
or any other party’s security holders or other constituencies vis-à-vis any other class or group of the Company’s, or such other party’s
security holders or other constituents (including, without limitation, the allocation of any consideration to be received in the
Transaction amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents). We are not expressing any opinion as to
the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Carolina Financial or the ability of the Company or
Carolina Financial to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
 
The delivery of this opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Raymond James.
 
Raymond James has been engaged to render financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed Transaction
and will receive a fee for such services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. Raymond
James will also receive a fee upon the delivery of this Opinion, which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the
Transaction or on the conclusion reached herein. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and to
indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
 
In the ordinary course of our business, Raymond James may trade in the securities of the Company and Carolina Financial for our own
account or for the accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.
Raymond James has provided certain services to Carolina Financial (in the previous two years), including serving as bookrunning
manager for its 2015 and 2017 public offerings of common equity, for which it has been paid fees. Furthermore, Raymond James may
provide investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to the Company and/or Carolina Financial or other
participants in the Transaction in the future, for which Raymond James may receive compensation.
 
It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in each director’s capacity as
such) in evaluating the proposed Transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company regarding
how said shareholder should vote on the proposed Transaction. Furthermore, this letter should not be construed as creating any
fiduciary duty on the part of Raymond James to any such party. This Opinion may not be reproduced or used for any other purpose
without our prior written consent, except that this Opinion may be disclosed in and filed with a proxy statement used in connection
with the Transaction that is required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided that this Opinion is quoted in
full in such proxy statement.
