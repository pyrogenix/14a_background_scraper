TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERGERS PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

To Stockholders of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation:
WestRock Company, a Delaware corporation (referred to as WestRock), KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation, a Delaware corporation

(referred to as KapStone), Whiskey Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as Holdco), Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(referred to as WestRock Merger Sub), and Kola Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as KapStone Merger Sub), have entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 28, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time (referred to as the merger agreement).
Pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to its terms and conditions, WestRock will acquire all of the outstanding shares of KapStone through a
transaction in which: (i) WestRock Merger Sub will merge with and into WestRock, with WestRock surviving such merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Holdco (referred to as the WestRock merger) and (ii) KapStone Merger Sub will merge with and into KapStone, with KapStone
surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (referred to as the KapStone merger and, together with the WestRock merger, referred
to as the mergers). We believe that the mergers will benefit the stockholders of KapStone and we ask for your support in voting for the KapStone
merger proposal at KapStone’s special meeting.

If the mergers are completed, each share of KapStone common stock (referred to as a KapStone share) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the mergers (referred to as the effective time) (excluding KapStone shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of KapStone, KapStone shares that are owned by KapStone as treasury shares or in respect of which a KapStone stockholder has perfected
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election
of the KapStone stockholder either: (i) $35.00 in cash, without interest thereon, or (ii) 0.4981 shares of Holdco common stock; subject to proration
procedures designed to ensure that shares of Holdco common stock are received in respect of no more than 25% of the KapStone shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. WestRock common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (referred to as the
NYSE) under the symbol “WRK” and KapStone common stock is currently traded on the NYSE under the symbol “KS”. We expect that Holdco
common stock will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol “WRK”. We urge you to obtain current market quotations of WestRock common
stock and KapStone common stock.

At the KapStone special meeting, KapStone stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on (i) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement
(referred to as the KapStone merger proposal), (ii) a proposal to adjourn the KapStone special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the KapStone merger proposal and (iii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the
compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided to KapStone’s named executive officers in connection with the mergers.
The KapStone board of directors unanimously recommends that KapStone stockholders vote “FOR” each of these proposals to be
considered at the KapStone special meeting.

The mergers cannot be completed unless the KapStone stockholders approve the KapStone merger proposal. Your vote is very important,
regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the KapStone special meeting, please promptly mark, sign
and date the accompanying proxy card and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

The obligations of WestRock and KapStone to complete the mergers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions set forth in
the merger agreement. More information about WestRock, KapStone, Holdco and the mergers is contained in this proxy statement/prospectus.
WestRock and KapStone encourage you to read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully, including the section entitled “Risk
Factors”, beginning on page 33.

We look forward to the successful combination of WestRock and KapStone.
Sincerely,

Roger W. Stone 
Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors 
KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation

Matthew Kaplan 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation

Q: What is the proposed transaction on which I am being asked to vote?

A: WestRock, KapStone, Holdco, KapStone Merger Sub and WestRock Merger Sub have entered into the
merger agreement that is described in this proxy statement/prospectus, and a copy of which is attached as
Annex A. Pursuant to the merger agreement and subject to its terms and conditions, WestRock will acquire
all of the outstanding shares of KapStone through a transaction in which: (i) WestRock Merger Sub will
merge with and into WestRock, with WestRock surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdco, and (ii) KapStone Merger Sub will merge with and into KapStone, with KapStone surviving such
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. As a result, among other things, (a) Holdco will become
the ultimate parent of WestRock, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries, (b) existing WestRock shares
will automatically convert into Holdco shares and (c) existing KapStone stockholders will receive Holdco
shares or cash, as described further below, in each case in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement. It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that the Holdco shares to be issued in
connection with the mergers be authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange (referred to as the
NYSE), subject to official notice of issuance. Following the completion of the mergers, Holdco will cause
KapStone shares to be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?

A: You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because you were a holder of record of KapStone shares
as of the close of business on July 30, 2018 (referred to as the record date).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following are some questions that you, as a KapStone stockholder, may have regarding the mergers and
the other matters being considered at the KapStone special meeting and the answers to those questions. You are
urged to read carefully the remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section
does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the mergers and the other
matters being considered at the KapStone special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in
the annexes to and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

About the Mergers

This proxy statement/prospectus serves as the proxy statement through which KapStone will solicit proxies
to obtain the necessary KapStone stockholder approval of the KapStone merger proposal (as defined below)
(such approval referred to as the KapStone stockholder approval). It also serves as the prospectus pursuant
to which Holdco will issue Holdco shares as consideration in the KapStone merger.

KapStone is holding a special meeting of stockholders (referred to as the KapStone special meeting) in order
to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to adopt the merger agreement. KapStone stockholders will
also be asked to approve the adjournment of the KapStone special meeting (if necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement) and to vote on a
non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable
or be provided to KapStone’s named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

We will be unable to complete the mergers unless, among other things, the KapStone stockholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement.

This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the mergers, the merger agreement
and the KapStone special meeting. You should read this information carefully and in its entirety. The
enclosed voting materials allow you to vote your shares without attending the KapStone special meeting.

Q: What will KapStone stockholders receive in the mergers?

A: If the mergers are completed, KapStone stockholders will have the right to elect to receive with respect to
each KapStone share they hold (other than KapStone shares in respect of which a KapStone stockholder has
properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (referred to as the DGCL)), subject to certain proration procedures described below, either: (i)
$35.00 in cash, without interest thereon (referred to as the KapStone cash consideration), or (ii) 0.4981
Holdco shares (referred to as the KapStone stock consideration, and, together with the KapStone cash
consideration, referred to as the KapStone merger consideration). KapStone stockholders will not receive
any fractional Holdco shares in the KapStone merger. Instead, KapStone stockholders will receive cash in
lieu of any fractional Holdco shares that they would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

Q: What ownership percentage of Holdco will former KapStone stockholders have after the mergers are
completed?

A: If the mergers are completed and the maximum stock amount is issued to KapStone stockholders, assuming
97.8 million KapStone shares are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and 256.5
million WestRock shares are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, approximately
4.5% of the issued and outstanding Holdco shares immediately following the effective time of the mergers
will be held by former KapStone stockholders. For information regarding the risk associated with a reduced
ownership in the combined company, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Mergers — KapStone
stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the mergers and will exercise less
influence over management”, beginning on page 37.

Q: Are KapStone stockholders guaranteed to receive the stock consideration if they elect to receive stock
consideration for their KapStone shares?

A: No. The maximum number of Holdco shares that may be issued to KapStone stockholders as KapStone
stock consideration (referred to as the maximum stock amount) is equal to (i) 25% of the product of  (A)
0.4981 and (B) the number of issued and outstanding KapStone shares immediately prior to the effective
time of the mergers (referred to as the effective time), (ii) rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other KapStone stockholders, if a KapStone stockholder
elects to receive the KapStone stock consideration, such holder may not receive the KapStone stock
consideration in respect of such stock election shares (as defined below). The greater the oversubscription of
the stock election (as defined below), the fewer Holdco shares and more cash a KapStone stockholder
making a stock election will receive in respect of its stock election shares. For further information, including
the potential effects of the proration procedures on what a hypothetical holder of 100 KapStone shares
would receive if such holder elected to receive the KapStone stock consideration for all of its KapStone
shares, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — The Merger Agreement 
— Effects of the Mergers; Closing; Effective Time”, beginning on page 99.

Q: How do I make my stock election if I am a KapStone stockholder?

A: Under the merger agreement, the KapStone stockholders are required to make an election to receive
KapStone stock consideration (referred to as a stock election) by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on
September 5, 2018, the business day immediately prior to the KapStone special meeting (referred to as the
election deadline). Concurrently with the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, an election form will
be mailed to each holder of record of KapStone shares for the KapStone special meeting. KapStone will
make available one or more election forms as may be reasonably requested from time to time by all persons
who become holders of record of KapStone shares during the period following the record date and prior to
the election deadline. To elect to receive Holdco shares, you must indicate on the election form the number
of KapStone shares with respect to which you elect to receive the KapStone stock consideration (such
KapStone shares referred to as stock election shares). You must return your properly completed and signed
form accompanied by the KapStone share certificate or an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery by
the election deadline. KapStone and WestRock will

Q: Can I revoke or change my stock election after I mail my election form?
A: Yes. Any election form may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the KapStone shares subject

thereto by the stockholder who submitted the applicable election form by written notice received by the
exchange agent prior to the election deadline. If an election form is revoked, the KapStone shares as to
which such stock election previously applied will be no election shares unless a stock election is
subsequently submitted by the stockholder prior to the election deadline. For more information, see the
section entitled “The KapStone Special Meeting — Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a KapStone
Stockholder’s Vote”, beginning on page 46.

Q: What happens if I do not make a stock election or my election form is not received before the election
deadline?

A: If a KapStone stockholder makes no stock election with respect to any of its KapStone shares or the
exchange agent does not receive a properly completed and signed election form by the election deadline and
such KapStone stockholder does not properly demand appraisal in accordance with the DGCL, it will
receive the KapStone cash consideration in respect of such shares. In no event will a KapStone stockholder
making no stock election with respect to its KapStone shares receive the KapStone stock consideration in
respect of any of its KapStone shares. For more information, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption
of the Merger Agreement — The Merger Agreement — Effect on the Capital Stock”, beginning on page 101.

Q: How do I calculate the value of the KapStone stock consideration?
A: The merger agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the exchange ratio based on

fluctuations in the market value of either KapStone shares or WestRock shares. Because of this, the implied
value of the KapStone stock consideration will fluctuate between now and the completion of the mergers.
The value of the KapStone stock consideration depends on the market value of Holdco shares at the time the
mergers are completed, which will in turn be affected by the market value of KapStone shares and
WestRock shares at the time the mergers are completed.

Q: Should I send in my share certificates now for the exchange?

A: No. KapStone stockholders should keep any share certificates they hold at this time. If a KapStone
stockholder intends to make a stock election for the KapStone stock consideration, it must send in any
KapStone share certificates it holds at the time it sends in the election form (or an appropriate customary
guarantee of delivery in lieu thereof). As promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time (and in
any event within three business days after the effective time), WestRock will cause the exchange agent to
mail to each holder of record of KapStone shares represented by certificates or book-entry shares not held
through DTC whose shares are converted into the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration
pursuant to the merger agreement a form of letter of transmittal, together with instructions thereto advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the KapStone merger and the conversion of KapStone shares into the
right to receive the KapStone merger consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

publicly announce by press release the election deadline at least three business days prior to the anticipated
election deadline, but you are encouraged to return your election form as promptly as practicable. If you
hold your KapStone shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions
provided by such bank, broker or other nominee to ensure that your election instructions are timely returned.
For further information, see the section entitled “The KapStone Special Meeting”, beginning on page 44. All
KapStone shares for which no stock election is made (referred to as no election shares) will be converted
into the right to receive KapStone cash consideration.

On January 26, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed mergers, the
closing price on the NYSE was $26.54 per KapStone share and $70.27 per WestRock share. On July 31,
2018, the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price on the
NYSE was $34.78 per KapStone share and $57.98 per WestRock share. We urge you to obtain current
market quotations before voting your shares.

Q: Who is the exchange agent for the mergers?

A: Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the exchange agent.

Q: When do you expect the mergers to be completed?

A: We are currently targeting completion of the mergers by the end of calendar year 2018, subject to the
required KapStone stockholder approval and regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
closing conditions. It is possible that factors outside the control of KapStone or WestRock could result in the
mergers being completed at a later time, or not at all.

Q: Will I still be paid dividends prior to the mergers?

A: KapStone most recently paid a quarterly dividend of  $0.10 per share to its stockholders. Under the merger
agreement, KapStone may, without WestRock’s consent, continue to declare and pay its regular quarterly
cash dividend in an amount of up to $0.10 per share. KapStone declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
$0.10 per share, which was paid on July 11, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 29, 2018.

Q: Are there any risks in the mergers that I should consider?

A: Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the WestRock merger and
KapStone merger. These risks are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Risk Factors”, beginning
on page 33.

Q: Are KapStone stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?

A: Yes. If the KapStone merger is completed, KapStone stockholders who have complied exactly with the
applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to demand appraisal of
their KapStone shares and receive in lieu of the KapStone merger consideration a cash payment equal to the
“fair value” of their KapStone shares. For more information, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption
of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights”, beginning on page 92.

Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?

A: The SEC permits KapStone to deliver a single copy of its proxy statements and annual reports to KapStone
stockholders who have the same address and last name, unless KapStone has received contrary instructions
from such KapStone stockholders. Each KapStone stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy
card. This procedure, called “householding”, will reduce the volume of duplicate information KapStone
stockholders receive and reduce KapStone’s printing and postage costs. KapStone will promptly deliver a
separate copy of this proxy statement/prospectus to any such KapStone stockholder upon written or oral
request. A stockholder wishing to receive a separate proxy statement/prospectus can notify KapStone at
KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation, 1101 Skokie Boulevard, Suite 300, Northbrook, IL 60062,
telephone: 847-239-8800. Similarly, KapStone stockholders currently receiving multiple copies of these
documents can request the elimination of duplicate documents by contacting KapStone as described above.

Q: When and where will the KapStone special meeting be held?

A: The KapStone special meeting is scheduled to be held at 1033 Skokie Boulevard, Suite 150, Northbrook,
Illinois 60062, on September 6, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. local time.

Q: What proposals will be considered at the KapStone special meeting?

merger proposal (referred to as the KapStone adjournment proposal); and

• to consider and vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation and benefits that
may be paid, become payable or be provided to KapStone’s named executive officers in connection
with the mergers (referred to as the KapStone compensation proposal).

Q: How does the KapStone board of directors recommend that I vote?
A: The KapStone board of directors (referred to as the KapStone board), on January 28, 2018, unanimously

approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, including the KapStone merger, and determined that the terms of
the merger agreement are in the best interests of KapStone and its stockholders and declared the merger
agreement advisable. The KapStone board unanimously recommends that KapStone stockholders vote
“FOR” each of the KapStone merger proposal, the KapStone adjournment proposal and the KapStone
compensation proposal.

Q: How do I vote?
A: If you are a holder of record of KapStone shares as of the close of business on the record date, you may vote

KapStone prior to the KapStone special meeting.

Q: What vote is required to approve each KapStone proposal?

outstanding entitled to vote at the KapStone special meeting.

Q: What will happen if I fail to vote or I abstain from voting?

A: If you are a KapStone stockholder and fail to vote or vote to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote
“AGAINST” the KapStone merger proposal, and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote
“AGAINST” the KapStone merger proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you are a KapStone

and entitled to vote thereon. If you are a KapStone stockholder and fail to vote or vote to abstain, it will have
the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the KapStone merger proposal. KapStone shares held by brokers or other
nominees that are present in person or by proxy at the KapStone special meeting, but with respect to which
the broker or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a
particular proposal and the broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such
proposal (referred to as broker non-votes), will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the KapStone merger
proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

KapStone Adjournment Proposal.   Assuming a quorum is present, approving the adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the KapStone shares present in person or represented
by proxy at the KapStone special meeting and entitled to vote on the KapStone adjournment proposal. If you
are a KapStone stockholder and fail to vote, it will have no effect on the KapStone adjournment proposal,

officers in connection with the mergers, as reported in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers

Q: What constitutes a quorum?

A: A quorum for action on any subject matter at any special meeting of KapStone stockholders will exist when
the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding KapStone shares entitled to vote on such subject
matter are represented in person or by proxy at such meeting. KapStone shares represented at the KapStone
special meeting but not voted, including KapStone shares for which a stockholder directs an “abstention”
from voting, will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes, if any, will
not be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. KapStone shares owned by KapStone as
treasury shares will not be included in the calculation of the number of KapStone shares represented at the
KapStone special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.

Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, will my broker automatically vote my shares for
me?

A: No. If you hold KapStone shares through a broker, bank, trust company or other nominee, you may instruct
your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee to vote your KapStone shares by following the
instructions that the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee provides to you with these materials.
Most brokers offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by completing a voting
instruction card, by telephone and via the Internet. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as present
for purposes of establishing a quorum.

Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?

A: If a signed proxy card is returned without an indication as to how the KapStone shares represented are to be
voted with regard to a particular proposal, the KapStone shares represented by the proxy card will be voted
“FOR” each such proposal.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have returned a proxy card or voting instruction card?

A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the KapStone special meeting. You
may do this in one of four ways:

• by sending a notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of KapStone, dated as of a later date than
the date of the proxy card and received by the Corporate Secretary of KapStone prior to the KapStone
special meeting;

• by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card and mailing it so
that it is received by the Corporate Secretary of KapStone prior to the KapStone special meeting; or

• by attending the KapStone special meeting and voting in person.

Q: What should KapStone stockholders do if they receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials with respect to the proposals described in this proxy

statement/prospectus, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards
or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your KapStone shares in more than one brokerage
account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account

TABLE OF CONTENTS

With respect to the KapStone merger proposal, a broker non-vote will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal. With respect to the KapStone adjournment proposal and the KapStone compensation proposal,
a broker non-vote will have no effect on such proposals.

If your KapStone shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote your KapStone shares in person at
the KapStone special meeting, you must bring to the KapStone special meeting a “legal proxy” executed in
your favor from the record holder (your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee) of the KapStone
shares authorizing you to vote at the KapStone special meeting.

Your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy. If your KapStone shares are held in “street name”, you
should follow the instructions of your broker regarding the revocation of proxies.

Q: May I transfer KapStone shares if I have elected to receive the KapStone stock consideration?
A: Yes, but once you make a stock election with respect to any KapStone shares, you will be unable to sell or

otherwise transfer such KapStone shares unless you properly revoke your stock election prior to the election
deadline or the merger agreement is terminated.

Q: What happens if I transfer my KapStone shares before the KapStone special meeting?
A: The record date is earlier than the date of the KapStone special meeting and the date that the mergers are

expected to be completed. If you transfer your KapStone shares after the record date but before the
KapStone special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the KapStone special meeting, but you will
not have the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration. In order to receive the KapStone merger
consideration, you must hold your KapStone shares through the completion of the mergers.

Q: Who is the inspector of election?
A: The KapStone board has appointed a representative of Morrow Sodali LLC to act as the inspector of

election for the KapStone special meeting.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the KapStone special meeting?
A: The preliminary voting results are expected to be announced at the KapStone special meeting. In addition,

within four business days following certification of the final voting results, KapStone intends to file the final
voting results of its special meeting with the SEC on Form 8-K.

Q: What will happen if all of the proposals to be considered at the KapStone special meeting are not
approved?

A: As a condition to the completion of the mergers, KapStone stockholders must approve the KapStone merger
proposal. Completion of the mergers is not conditioned or dependent on approval of any of the other
proposals to be considered at the KapStone special meeting.

Q: Why are KapStone stockholders being asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the
compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided to KapStone’s named
executive officers in connection with the mergers?

A: The rules promulgated by the SEC under Section 14A of the Exchange Act require KapStone to seek a non-
binding, advisory vote with respect to certain compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable
or be provided to KapStone’s named executive officers in connection with the mergers. For more
information regarding such payments, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers in the Mergers”, beginning on page 77.

Q: What will happen if KapStone stockholders do not approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the
compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided to KapStone’s named
executive officers in connection with the mergers?

A: The vote on the KapStone compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the KapStone
merger proposal. Accordingly, a KapStone stockholder may vote to approve the KapStone merger proposal
and vote not to approve the KapStone compensation proposal, and vice versa.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record of KapStone shares and your KapStone shares are
registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. In each case, please complete,
sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your
shares are voted.

Because the vote on the KapStone compensation proposal is advisory only, the outcome of such vote will
not be binding on KapStone or Holdco. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted by
the KapStone stockholders and the mergers are completed, the compensation and benefits with respect to the
named executive officers of KapStone will be payable or be provided, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the KapStone compensation proposal.

The Mergers and the Merger Agreement

A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated herein by reference. KapStone and WestRock encourage you to read the entire merger agreement
carefully because it is the principal document governing the mergers and this summary description of the merger
agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement. For more
information on the merger agreement, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — 
The Merger Agreement”, beginning on page 99.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

After the Mergers

Effect on the Capital Stock (See page 101)

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, KapStone stockholders will have the
right to elect to receive with respect to each KapStone share they hold (other than KapStone shares in respect of
which a KapStone stockholder has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL), subject to
certain proration procedures described below, either: (i) the KapStone cash consideration, which is $35.00 in
cash, without interest thereon, or (ii) the KapStone stock consideration, which is 0.4981 Holdco shares. KapStone
stockholders will not receive any fractional Holdco shares in the KapStone merger. Instead, KapStone
stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional Holdco shares that they would otherwise have been
entitled to receive.

Under the merger agreement, the maximum stock amount, which is the maximum number of Holdco shares
that may be issued to KapStone stockholders as KapStone stock consideration, is equal to (i) 25% of the product
of  (A) 0.4981 and (B) the number of issued and outstanding KapStone shares immediately prior to the effective
time, (ii) rounded down to the nearest whole number.

A KapStone stockholder’s ability to make a stock election is subject to proration procedures set forth in the
merger agreement. These procedures are designed to ensure that the KapStone stock consideration is received in
respect of no more than 25% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time. Whether a KapStone stockholder receives the amount of KapStone stock consideration requested will
depend in part on the stock elections of other KapStone stockholders. Even if a KapStone stockholder makes a
stock election with respect to any KapStone shares, it may not receive the KapStone stock consideration in
respect of such stock election shares. The greater the oversubscription of the stock election, the fewer Holdco
shares and more cash a KapStone stockholder making a stock election will receive in respect of its stock election
shares.

If the mergers are completed and the maximum stock amount is issued to KapStone stockholders, assuming
97.8 million KapStone shares are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and 256.5
million WestRock shares are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, approximately 4.5%
of the issued and outstanding Holdco shares immediately following the effective time of the mergers will be held
by former KapStone stockholders.

If a KapStone stockholder makes no stock election with respect to any of its KapStone shares and does not
properly demand appraisal in accordance with the DGCL, it will receive the KapStone cash consideration in
respect of such shares. In no event will a KapStone stockholder making no stock election with respect to its
KapStone shares receive the KapStone stock consideration in respect of any of its KapStone shares. For a
description of the applicable stock election procedures, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement — The Merger Agreement — Election Procedures”, beginning on page 102.

The merger agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the exchange ratio based on
fluctuations in the market value of either KapStone shares or WestRock shares. Because of this, the implied

TABLE OF CONTENTS

value of the KapStone stock consideration will fluctuate between now and the completion of the mergers. The
value of the KapStone stock consideration depends on the market value of Holdco shares at the time the mergers
are completed, which will in turn be affected by the market value of KapStone shares and WestRock shares at the
time the mergers are completed.

At the effective time, each issued and outstanding WestRock share will be converted into one Holdco share.

On January 26, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed mergers, the
closing price on the NYSE was $26.54 per KapStone share and $70.27 per WestRock share. On July 31, 2018,
the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price on the NYSE was
$34.78 per KapStone share and $57.98 per WestRock share. We urge you to obtain current market quotations
before voting your shares.

Treatment of KapStone Stock Options; Other KapStone Equity-Based Awards and the KapStone ESPP (See
page 89)

Each option to purchase KapStone shares (referred to as a KapStone option) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will be converted at the effective time into an option to purchase, on the same terms
and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements, but subject to the amendments described below with
respect to equity-based awards outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement) as were applicable to such
KapStone option immediately prior to the effective time, a number of Holdco shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of KapStone shares subject to the KapStone option
by a fraction, the numerator of which is $35.00 and the denominator of which is the average of the volume
weighted average price per share of WestRock shares on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or another
authoritative source mutually selected by WestRock and KapStone) on each of the five consecutive trading days
ending with the second complete trading day immediately prior to the closing date (as defined below) (referred to
as the equity award exchange ratio), at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the KapStone option by the equity award exchange ratio.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any KapStone option held by a non-employee member of the KapStone board
will vest in full upon the effective time.

Each KapStone restricted stock unit award (referred to as a KapStone RSU award) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will be converted at the effective time into a Holdco restricted stock unit
award, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements, but subject to the
amendments described below with respect to equity-based awards outstanding as of the date of the merger
agreement, and including any rights in respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were accrued but unpaid as of
immediately prior to the effective time) as were applicable to such KapStone RSU award immediately prior to the
effective time, and relating to the number of Holdco shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying the number of KapStone shares subject to the KapStone RSU award by the equity award exchange
ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any KapStone RSU award held by a non-employee member of the
KapStone board will vest in full upon the effective time.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, KapStone options and KapStone RSU awards that were outstanding as of
the date of the merger agreement (other than awards held by a non-employee member of the KapStone board)
have been amended to provide that such KapStone options and KapStone RSU awards will immediately vest in
full if, following the effective time, the award holder experiences a termination of employment by KapStone or
any of its affiliates without “cause” or resigns employment for “good reason”, as described below in “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement — The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and
Employee Stock Purchase Plans”. With respect to KapStone’s 2018 annual equity grants made as of February 23,
2018 (which consisted entirely of KapStone RSU awards), two-thirds of each such award was made subject to the
same “double-trigger” vesting conditions described in the preceding sentence. The remaining one-third of each
such award would be forfeited upon any termination of employment prior to the normal vesting date.

Prior to the effective time, the KapStone board (or, if appropriate, an administering committee) has taken or
will take all actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that (i) the offering period under the KapStone
Paper and Packaging Corporation 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (referred to as the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KapStone ESPP) that commenced on January 1, 2018 will be the final offering period under the KapStone ESPP,
(ii) no new participants may join the KapStone ESPP on or after the date of the merger agreement, (iii) no
participant may increase the amount of his or her salary deferrals with respect to the offering period that
commenced on January 1, 2018 and (iv) the KapStone ESPP will terminate on the earlier of (A) immediately
following the purchase date for the offering period that commenced on January 1, 2018 and (B) two business
days prior to the effective time, in which case all participant contributions then in the KapStone ESPP will be
used to purchase KapStone shares on such date in accordance with the terms of the KapStone ESPP as if such
date was the purchase date for such offering period, and such KapStone shares will be no election shares.

Treatment of WestRock Options; Other WestRock Equity-Based Awards and the WestRock ESPP (See page 90)

At the effective time, each WestRock restricted stock unit award (referred to as a WestRock RSU award),
WestRock restricted stock award, option to purchase WestRock shares (referred to as a WestRock option),
WestRock stock appreciation right (referred to as a WestRock SAR) and WestRock director stock unit award will
be assumed by Holdco and will become a restricted stock unit award, restricted stock award, stock option, stock
appreciation right or director stock unit, as applicable, of Holdco with respect to an equivalent number of Holdco
shares on the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the effective time.

Prior to the effective time, the WestRock board of directors (referred to as the WestRock board) will take all
actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that (i) the WestRock Company Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (referred to as the WestRock ESPP) will be assumed by Holdco (with appropriate adjustments to the terms
of the WestRock ESPP, including the securities issuable thereunder) and (ii) each outstanding purchase right
under the WestRock ESPP will be converted into a purchase right to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such purchase right as of immediately prior to the effective time, a number of Holdco shares
determined in accordance with the terms of the assumed WestRock ESPP.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers (See page 83)

WestRock and KapStone intend for the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock merger, to
qualify as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to
time, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (referred to as the Code). It is a condition to
KapStone’s obligation to complete the KapStone merger that KapStone receive an opinion from Sidley Austin
LLP (referred to as Sidley), counsel to KapStone, or another nationally recognized law firm, to the effect that the
KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock merger, should qualify as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code. Assuming the receipt and accuracy of the opinion described above, and subject to the
limitations and qualifications described in “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to U.S. Holders of KapStone Shares”, the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the KapStone merger to U.S. holders (as defined on page 84) of KapStone shares are as
follows:

The consequences of the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock merger, to a U.S. holder
of KapStone shares will depend on the relative mix of cash and Holdco shares received by the U.S. holder in the
KapStone merger. A U.S. holder of KapStone shares that exchanges all of its KapStone shares solely for Holdco
shares will generally not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of
KapStone shares for Holdco shares in the KapStone merger, except with respect to any cash received in lieu of
fractional Holdco shares. A U.S. holder of KapStone shares that exchanges all of its KapStone shares solely for
cash generally will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount of cash received
in the KapStone merger and the U.S. holder’s basis in the KapStone shares surrendered in exchange for such
cash. A U.S. holder of KapStone shares that exchanges KapStone shares for a combination of Holdco shares and
cash will recognize gain (but not loss), but the U.S. holder’s taxable gain in that case will not exceed the amount
of cash received in the KapStone merger.

Agreement — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to U.S. Holders of

Recommendation of the KapStone Board of Directors (See page 58)
After careful consideration, on January 28, 2018 the KapStone board unanimously approved and adopted the

merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, including the KapStone merger, determined that the terms of the merger agreement are in the best
interests of KapStone and its stockholders, declared the merger agreement advisable and further resolved to
recommend that KapStone stockholders approve the KapStone merger proposal (referred to as the KapStone
recommendation) and approve the KapStone compensation proposal. The KapStone board unanimously
recommends that KapStone stockholders vote “FOR” each of the KapStone merger proposal, the KapStone
adjournment proposal and the KapStone compensation proposal. For a summary of the factors considered by the
KapStone board in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, as well as the KapStone board’s reasons for, and certain risks related to, the KapStone
merger, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: The Adoption of the Merger Agreement — KapStone’s Reasons for
the Mergers; Recommendation of the KapStone Board of Directors”, beginning on page 58.

Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors (See page 64)

Rothschild Inc. (referred to as Rothschild)
KapStone retained Rothschild to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. In connection

with Rothschild’s engagement, the KapStone board requested that Rothschild evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone
stockholders in the mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. On January 28, 2018, at a meeting of
the KapStone board held to evaluate the mergers, Rothschild rendered to the KapStone board an oral opinion,
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, to the effect that, as of that date and based on
and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in Rothschild’s written
opinion, the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the mergers pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such KapStone stockholders.

The full text of Rothschild’s written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, to the KapStone board, which sets
forth, among other things, the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Rothschild in connection with such opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/ prospectus as
Annex B. The description of Rothschild’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of Rothschild’s opinion. Rothschild’s opinion was provided for the benefit of
the KapStone board (solely in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the
mergers and was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone
cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement. Rothschild’s opinion did not address the underlying decision that KapStone made to engage in the
mergers or any alternative transaction, including the relative merits of the mergers as compared to any alternative
transaction, including any alternative transaction that the KapStone board has considered and elected not to
pursue. Rothschild’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the KapStone board as to whether to
approve the mergers or a recommendation as to whether or not any KapStone stockholder should vote, make any
election or otherwise act with respect to the mergers or any other matter.

For a description of the opinion that the KapStone board received from Rothschild, see the section entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors — Rothschild
Inc.”, beginning on page 64.

Moelis & Company LLC (referred to as Moelis)
KapStone retained Moelis to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. In connection with

Moelis’ engagement, the KapStone board requested that Moelis evaluate the fairness, from a financial

point of view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash consideration to be received by KapStone
stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement. On January 25, 2018, Moelis presented its preliminary financial
analysis of KapStone to the KapStone board. On January 28, 2018, at a meeting of the KapStone board held to
evaluate the mergers, Moelis rendered to the KapStone board an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion, dated January 28, 2018, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, based on and subject to the
qualifications, conditions, limitations and assumptions set forth in Moelis’ written opinion, the KapStone cash
consideration to be received by KapStone stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the KapStone stockholders.

The full text of Moelis’ written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Moelis in connection with
such opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. The description of Moelis’ opinion set
forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Moelis’ opinion.
Moelis’ opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the KapStone board (solely in its capacity as such) in its
evaluation of the mergers. Moelis’ opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
KapStone cash consideration and does not address KapStone’s underlying business decision to effect the mergers
or the relative merits of the mergers as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might
be available with respect to KapStone. Moelis’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
KapStone stockholder should vote, make any election (including without limitation, a stock election), or act with
respect to the mergers or any other matter.

For a description of the opinion that the KapStone board received from Moelis, see the section entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors — Moelis &
Company LLC”, beginning on page 71.

Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers in the Mergers (See page 77)

The executive officers and directors of KapStone have certain interests, including financial interests, in the
mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of KapStone stockholders generally. Such
interests include the treatment of KapStone equity-based awards held by executive officers and directors, as well
as payments and benefits to which certain executive officers may become entitled under certain change in control
severance agreements and success and/or retention bonus arrangements, in each case in connection with the
mergers. The KapStone board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and in making the KapStone
recommendation.

Directors and Officers of Holdco Following the Mergers (See page 83)

Pursuant to the merger agreement and Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the directors of WestRock at the
effective time will, from and after the effective time, be the directors of Holdco, and the officers of WestRock at
the effective time will, from and after the effective time, be the officers of Holdco.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers (See page 87)

The mergers are subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended (referred to as the HSR Act), which prevents WestRock and KapStone from completing the mergers
until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is terminated or expires, and under the following laws of
foreign jurisdictions: the Mexican Federal Law of Economic Competition, the Austrian Competition Act and the
German Act Against Restraints of Competition.

While WestRock and KapStone expect to obtain all required regulatory clearances, we cannot assure you
that these regulatory clearances will be obtained, that all required clearances will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the mergers, including the requirement to divest assets, or require
changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the
mergers not being satisfied. WestRock and KapStone cannot assure you that a challenge to the mergers will not
be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.

Completion of the Mergers (See page 129)

We are currently targeting completion of the mergers by the end of calendar year 2018, subject to the
required KapStone stockholder approval and regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
closing conditions. It is possible that factors outside the control of KapStone or WestRock could result in the
mergers being completed at a later time or not at all.

No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals (See page 117)

Except as expressly permitted in the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the
earlier of the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, KapStone
has agreed not to:

Discussions; Notice of Acquisition Proposals (See page 118)

If at any time prior to obtaining the KapStone stockholder approval, KapStone receives a written acquisition
proposal from any third party that did not result from a violation of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger
agreement, KapStone and its representatives may:

KapStone has agreed to promptly notify WestRock in writing after receipt by KapStone of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

At any time prior to the effective time, the parties to the merger agreement may waive the satisfaction of any
of the respective conditions to such party’s obligations to complete the mergers contained in the merger
agreement. No waiver by KapStone will require the approval of the KapStone stockholders unless such approval
is required by applicable law. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement — Amendment — Extension;
Waiver”, beginning on page 135.

We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the mergers will be satisfied or waived, or that the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Under the merger agreement, KapStone may be required to reimburse WestRock’s expenses up to
$17,600,104 if the merger agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances. No reimbursement of
such expenses will be required if KapStone has previously paid the termination fee.

The Voting Agreements (See page 135)
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement on January 28, 2018, as inducement for WestRock

to enter into the merger agreement, WestRock entered into separate voting agreements (each referred to as a
voting agreement and collectively, the voting agreements) with each of Mr. Roger Stone, Mr. Matthew Kaplan,
the Roger W. Stone Revocable Trust and the Roger and Susan Stone Family Foundation, which together
beneficially owned shares totaling approximately 9.5% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of
January 28, 2018 (which includes KapStone options that were exercisable and KapStone RSUs that would vest
within 60 days of January 28, 2018) and owned, with the right to vote at the KapStone special meeting, 8.1% of
the KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of the record date (which does not include KapStone options that
are exercisable or KapStone RSUs that will vest within 60 days of the record date).

Pursuant to the voting agreements, each such stockholder agreed during the term of its respective voting
agreement to, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, (i) vote all of its
KapStone shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and in favor of the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and against, among other things, any alternative transaction
that may be proposed, (ii) not solicit alternative transactions or participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding alternative transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) subject to certain
exceptions, not sell or otherwise transfer its KapStone shares. Each voting agreement may terminate in certain
circumstances, including upon termination of the merger agreement or upon an amendment to the merger
agreement that extends the end date or reduces the amount or changes the form of the KapStone merger
consideration, if such stockholder has abstained from voting on or voted against such matter in such stockholder’s
capacity as a director of KapStone.

Accounting Treatment (See page 86)
The mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with

Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, referred to as ASC 805. United States
generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as U.S. GAAP) requires that one of WestRock or KapStone
be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes based on the evidence available. WestRock will be treated
as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. In identifying WestRock as the acquiring entity, WestRock and
KapStone took into account the composition of the governing body of Holdco, and the size of each of WestRock
and KapStone.

Appraisal Rights (See page 92)
If the KapStone merger is completed, KapStone stockholders who comply exactly with the applicable

requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to demand appraisal of their KapStone
shares and receive in lieu of the KapStone merger consideration a cash payment equal to the “fair value” of their
KapStone shares (such shares for which appraisal is properly demanded referred to as dissenting shares), as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (referred to as the Court of Chancery), in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL, plus interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, subject to the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Such appraised value may be greater than, the same as or less than the
KapStone merger consideration. Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy
statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to
the complexity of the procedures for exercising and perfecting the right to seek appraisal, KapStone stockholders
who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. Failure to comply
exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in a loss of the right of
appraisal. A KapStone stockholder who submits a proxy card and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
mark “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” with respect to the KapStone merger proposal. KapStone stockholders who
wish to exercise their appraisal rights and hold shares in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee must
instruct their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to take the steps necessary to enable them to demand appraisal
for their shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Listing, Delisting and Deregistration (See page 91)

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that the Holdco shares to be issued in connection with the
mergers be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. Following the completion of
the mergers, Holdco will cause the KapStone shares to be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Exchange Act.
Comparison of Rights of Holdco Stockholders and KapStone Stockholders (See page 144)

Upon completion of the mergers, KapStone stockholders receiving the KapStone stock consideration will
become stockholders of Holdco and their rights will continue to be governed by Delaware law, including the
DGCL, and will be governed by the governing corporate documents of Holdco in effect at the effective time.
KapStone stockholders will have different rights once they become Holdco stockholders due to differences
between the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Holdco and KapStone. These differences are described in
detail under “Comparison of Rights of Holdco Stockholders and KapStone Stockholders”, beginning on page
144.
The KapStone Special Meeting (See page 44)

The KapStone special meeting is scheduled to be held at 1033 Skokie Boulevard, Suite 150, Northbrook,
Illinois 60062 on September 6, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. local time. At the KapStone special meeting, KapStone
stockholders will be asked:

You may vote at the KapStone special meeting if you owned KapStone shares at the close of business on the
record date. You may cast one vote for each KapStone share that you owned as of the close of business on the
record date. As of the close of business on the record date, there were issued and outstanding a total of
97,840,381 KapStone shares entitled to vote at the KapStone special meeting. As of the close of business on the
record date, approximately 10.2% of the issued and outstanding KapStone shares were held by KapStone
directors, executive officers and their affiliates.

KapStone currently expects that its directors and executive officers will vote their KapStone shares in favor
of the KapStone merger proposal, the KapStone adjournment proposal and the KapStone compensation proposal.
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement on January 28, 2018, as inducement for WestRock to
enter into the merger agreement, WestRock entered into separate voting agreements with Roger W. Stone,
Executive Chairman of the KapStone board, and certain affiliated entities, which together beneficially owned
shares totaling approximately 5.9% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of January 28, 2018 (which
includes KapStone options that were exercisable and KapStone RSUs that would vest within 60 days of
January 28, 2018) and owned, with the right to vote at the KapStone special meeting, 5.2% of the KapStone
shares issued and outstanding as of the record date (which does not include KapStone options that are exercisable
or KapStone RSUs that will vest within 60 days of the record date), and with Matthew Kaplan, KapStone’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, who beneficially owned shares totaling approximately 3.6% of the
KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of January 28, 2018 (which includes KapStone options that were
exercisable and KapStone RSUs that would vest within 60 days of January 28, 2018) and owned, with the right to
vote at the KapStone special meeting, 2.9% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of the record date
(which does not include KapStone options that are exercisable or KapStone RSUs that will vest within 60 days of
the record date). Each of Messrs. Stone and Kaplan agreed during the term of his respective voting agreement to,
among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, (i) vote all the KapStone shares that he
beneficially owns in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any alternative transaction that
may be proposed, (ii) not solicit alternative transactions or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
alternative transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) subject to certain exceptions, will not
sell or otherwise transfer his KapStone shares.

Completion of the mergers is conditioned on the KapStone stockholder approval. Assuming a quorum is
present, the KapStone stockholder approval requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the KapStone
shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the KapStone merger proposal. Assuming

Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (referred to as the ASU). The ASU
applies to all employers that offer to their employees defined benefit pension plans, other postretirement
benefit plans, or other types of benefits accounted for under Topic 715, Compensation —  Retirement
Benefits. The ASU requires that an employer report the service cost component of net benefit cost in the
same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent
employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the
income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from
operations, if one is presented. If a separate line item or items are used to present the other components of
net benefit cost, that line item or items must be appropriately described. If a separate line item or items are
not used, the line item or items used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit
cost must be disclosed. The ASU also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for
capitalization when applicable (e.g., as a cost of internally manufactured inventory or a self-constructed
asset). Effective January 1, 2018, KapStone adopted the ASU applying the allowable practical expedient by
using the amounts disclosed in the pension and other postretirement benefit plan footnote for the prior
comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements to the
periods presented. This resulted in a $5.9 million, $5.6 million, $12.2 million, $14.5 million and $6.7 million
reclassification between operating income and pension income in KapStone’s consolidated statements of
comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
which reduced operating income accordingly. This resulted in a $3.1 million reclassification between cost of
sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, and pension and postretirement income in KapStone’s
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the six months ended June 30, 2017. This
reclassification did not affect KapStone’s net income, earnings per share, financial position, or cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF WESTROCK

The following table sets forth selected historical consolidated financial information for WestRock. The
historical consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows data for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of
September 30, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of
WestRock. The consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2013 was derived from audited consolidated
financial statements of Rock-Tenn Company (referred to as RockTenn). RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in
the business combination of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco Corporation which occurred on July 1, 2015 (referred
to as the combination); therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements of RockTenn for periods prior to
the combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of WestRock and thus WestRock’s
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 reflect RockTenn’s consolidated financial statements for periods
from October 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, and WestRock’s thereafter. The table that follows is consistent with
those presentations with the exception of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders, diluted
weighted average shares outstanding, dividends per common share and book value per common share that have
been adjusted retroactively due to RockTenn’s August 2014 two-for-one stock split. The combination was the
primary reason for the changes in the selected financial data in fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared to prior
fiscal years due to the size and timing of the transaction. The selected financial data presented below has been
updated to reflect the distribution of the outstanding common stock of Ingevity Corporation to WestRock
stockholders on May 15, 2016 to complete the separation of the former Specialty Chemicals business of
WestRock as an independent company.

The unaudited selected historical consolidated financial information for WestRock for the six months ended
March 31, 2018 and as of March 31, 2018 has been derived from WestRock’s unaudited consolidated financial
statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which is
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited consolidated financial information
includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which WestRock considers necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for this interim period. The results of
operations for the six months ended March 31, 2018 may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for
the entire fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.

The following information should be read together with WestRock’s consolidated financial statements and
the notes related to those financial statements incorporated herein by reference. See the section entitled “Where
You Can Find More Information”, beginning on page 156. WestRock’s historical consolidated financial
information may not be indicative of the future performance of WestRock or the combined company.

(1) In fiscal 2016, WestRock used plan assets to settle $2.5 billion of pension obligations of the WestRock
Company Consolidated Pension Plan (referred to as the plan) by purchasing group annuity contracts from
Prudential. This transaction transferred payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed to
approximately 35,000 U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. As a result, WestRock recorded a non-cash
charge of  $370.7 million pre-tax.

(2) In the six months ended March 31, 2018, WestRock recorded an estimated multiemployer pension
withdrawal liability of  $180.0 million.

(3) In fiscal 2017, lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the plan, together with several one-time
severance benefit payments out of the plan, triggered pension settlement accounting and a remeasurement of
the plan. As a result of settlement accounting, WestRock recognized as a current period expense a pro-rata
portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss, after remeasurement, and recorded a $32.6 million non-cash
charge to its earnings. In fiscal 2015, payments were made to former employees to partially settle
obligations of one of WestRock’s qualified defined benefit pension plans and it recorded a non-cash pre-tax
charge of  $20.0 million. In addition, changes in retiree medical coverage for certain employees covered by
the United Steelworkers Union master agreement resulted in the recognition of an $8.5 million pre-tax
curtailment gain. These two items netted to an $11.5 million pre-tax charge. In fiscal 2014, WestRock
completed the first phase of its previously announced lump sum pension settlement to certain eligible former
employees and recorded a pre-tax charge of $47.9 million.

(4) In the six months ended March 31, 2018, WestRock recorded a $27.6 million pre-tax non-cash impairment
of certain mineral rights and real estate in its Land and Development segment. Due to the accelerated
monetization strategy in its Land and Development segment, WestRock recorded a pre-tax

(5) On April 6, 2017, WestRock completed the sale of Home, Health and Beauty (referred to as HH&B), a
former division of its Consumer Packaging segment. In fiscal 2017, WestRock recorded a pre-tax gain on
the sale of HH&B of  $192.8 million.

(6) In the six months ended March 31, 2018, WestRock recorded an estimated $1,118.4 million income tax
benefit as a result of the passage of the Tax Act.

(7) Income from continuing operations was impacted by the sale of HH&B, restructuring and other costs, net,
the Land and Development impairment, the pension lump sum settlements and pension risk transfer as
identified in the table above for the respective years. In addition, income from continuing operations in
fiscal 2017 was reduced by $26.5 million pre-tax for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase
accounting, primarily related to the acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions International Limited, and
fiscal 2015 was reduced by $64.7 million pre-tax for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase
accounting, primarily related to the combination. Income from continuing operations in fiscal 2015, 2014
and 2013 was increased as a result of a reduction of cost of goods sold of  $6.7 million, $32.3 million and
$12.2 million pre-tax, respectively, due to the recording of additional value of spare parts at WestRock’s
containerboard mills acquired in the acquisition of Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation (referred to as the
Smurfit-Stone acquisition). Income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 was increased by the reversal
of  $254.1 million of tax reserves related to alternative fuel mixture credits acquired in the Smurfit-Stone
acquisition that were partially offset by a resulting increase in a state tax valuation allowance of 
$1.2 million.

(8) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in fiscal 2016 included a $478.3 million pre-tax goodwill
impairment charge and $101.1 million pre-tax customer list impairment charge associated with WestRock’s
former Specialty Chemicals operations. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in fiscal 2015 was
reduced by $8.2 million pre-tax for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of
related last-in first-out valuation method impact.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/ 
prospectus, including the matters addressed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements”, beginning on page 41, you should carefully consider the following risks before deciding
whether to vote for the proposals described herein. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated
with each of the businesses of WestRock and KapStone because these risks will also affect the combined company.
Descriptions of some of these risks can be found in WestRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2017, WestRock’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended
December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, KapStone’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017 and KapStone’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018
and June 30, 2018, as, in each case, updated by any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current
Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus
and the other documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled
“Where You Can Find More Information”, beginning on page 156.

Risks Related to the Mergers

The announcement and pendency of the mergers may adversely affect the business, financial condition and
results of operations of WestRock, KapStone and, consequently, the combined company.

Uncertainty about the effect of the mergers on employees, customers, suppliers and other parties may have
an adverse effect on each of the respective businesses, financial conditions and results of operations of WestRock
and KapStone, regardless of whether the mergers are completed, and may have an adverse effect on the business,
financial condition and results of operations of the combined company if the mergers are completed. These risks
include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the mergers:

Failure to consummate the mergers within the expected timeframe or at all could have a material adverse
impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of WestRock, KapStone and consequently
of the combined company.

There can be no assurance that the mergers will occur. Consummation of the mergers is subject to specified
conditions, including:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1325281/000114420418041383/tv498833-defm14a.htm 44/269

• the absence of any material law or order in effect that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the
consummation of the mergers;

• the Registration Statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, being
declared effective;

• the Holdco shares to be issued with the Holdco stock issuance being authorized for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance;

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties and compliance by the parties with
their respective obligations under the merger agreement, in each case subject to certain materiality
qualifiers; and

• the receipt of opinions of counsel regarding the intended tax treatment of the KapStone merger and the
WestRock merger.

• changes in KapStone’s and WestRock’s respective businesses, operations and prospects;

• changes in market assessments of the business, operations, financial position and prospects of either
company or the combined company;

• market assessments of the likelihood that the KapStone merger will be completed;

• interest rates, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the trading
price of KapStone shares and WestRock shares;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and antitrust notification and approvals
required under the Mexican Federal Law of Economic Competition, the Austrian Competition Act and
the German Act Against Restraints of Competition;

For additional information regarding the specified conditions to the closing of the mergers, see the section
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Closing
of the Mergers”, beginning on page 129.

We cannot provide any assurances that these conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all or that
the mergers will occur.

In addition, the merger agreement contains certain termination rights, including (i) for KapStone and
WestRock if the mergers are not consummated on or before October 29, 2018 (which deadline may be extended
under certain circumstances to April 29, 2019), (ii) for KapStone and WestRock if KapStone stockholders fail to
approve the KapStone merger proposal at the KapStone special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof or (iii) for KapStone, prior to receiving the KapStone stockholder approval, in order to enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for a superior proposal after complying with its non-solicitation
obligations under the merger agreement, if KapStone pays to WestRock the termination fee under the merger
agreement of  $105,600,265. If KapStone is required to make such payment, doing so may materially adversely
affect KapStone’s business, financial conditions and liquidity.

In addition, satisfying the conditions to the mergers may take longer, and could cost more, than KapStone
and WestRock expect. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination may adversely affect
the benefits KapStone and WestRock expect to achieve from the mergers and the respective trading prices of
KapStone shares and WestRock shares. In addition, if the mergers do not close, the attention of KapStone’s
management and WestRock’s management will have been diverted to the consummation of the mergers, rather
than their respective operations and pursuit of other opportunities.

The number of Holdco shares that will be received per KapStone share by KapStone stockholders receiving
KapStone stock consideration in the KapStone merger is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any
change in the trading price of either KapStone shares or WestRock shares.

The exchange ratio is fixed in the merger agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the trading price
of either KapStone shares or WestRock shares, which changes may result from a variety of factors (many of
which are beyond the control of KapStone and WestRock), including:

• federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses in
which KapStone and WestRock operate; and

• other factors beyond the control of KapStone and WestRock, including those described in this “Risk
Factors” section.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

As a result, the implied value of the KapStone stock consideration will fluctuate between now and the
completion of the mergers. The value of the KapStone stock consideration depends on the market value of
Holdco shares at the time the mergers are completed, which will in turn be affected by the market value of
KapStone shares and WestRock shares at the time the mergers are completed.

The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire
KapStone.

The merger agreement contains provisions that apply both during the pendency of the mergers, as well as
afterward should the merger agreement be terminated under certain circumstances, that may discourage a third
party from submitting an acquisition proposal to KapStone that might result in greater value to KapStone
stockholders than the mergers. These merger agreement provisions include a general prohibition on KapStone
from soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any
acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions during the pendency of the KapStone merger. In
addition, WestRock generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement in response to any acquisition proposals. If the merger agreement is terminated, in certain
circumstances, KapStone would be required to pay WestRock a termination fee of $105,600,265 or reimburse
WestRock for its expenses incurred in connection with the mergers in an amount up to $17,600,104.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are
not presently anticipated or that cannot be met.

Before the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the KapStone merger, may be
completed, various clearances and approvals must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental
authorities as described in “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Regulatory Clearances Required
for the Mergers”. These regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such
approvals. Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying
completion of the mergers or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the
mergers. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion and may
contain conditions on the completion of the mergers. However, if any such conditions impose a “burdensome
effect” as defined in the merger agreement, the parties may not be obligated to accept or agree to such conditions
in order to obtain the regulatory approvals.

Executive officers and directors of KapStone have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of KapStone stockholders.

The executive officers and directors of KapStone have certain interests, including financial interests, in the
mergers that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of KapStone stockholders generally. Such
interests include the treatment of KapStone equity-based awards held by executive officers and directors, as well
as payments and benefits to which certain executive officers may become entitled under certain change in control
severance agreements and success and/or retention bonus arrangements, in each case in connection with the
mergers. The KapStone board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and in making the KapStone
recommendation. For additional information, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers in the Mergers”, beginning on page 77.

If a KapStone stockholder makes a stock election with respect to any KapStone shares, it may not receive the
KapStone stock consideration in respect of such stock election shares.

Although each KapStone stockholder may elect to receive, in connection with the KapStone merger, the
KapStone stock consideration, stock elections are subject to proration procedures that are designed to ensure that
the KapStone stock consideration is received in respect of no more than 25% of the KapStone

shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Accordingly, depending on the stock
elections made by other KapStone stockholders, if a KapStone stockholder makes a stock election, such holder
may not receive the KapStone stock consideration in respect of such stock election shares. The greater the
oversubscription of the stock election, the fewer Holdco shares and more cash a KapStone stockholder making a
stock election will receive in respect of its stock election shares. See the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement — The Merger Agreement — Proration Procedures”, beginning on page 103, for more
information. If a KapStone stockholder makes no stock election with respect to any of its KapStone shares or the
exchange agent does not receive a properly completed and signed election form by the election deadline and such
stockholder does not properly demand appraisal in accordance with the DGCL, it will receive the KapStone cash
consideration in respect of such shares. In addition, no fractional Holdco shares will be issued in the KapStone
merger, and KapStone stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional Holdco shares.

Holders of the Holdco shares to be received by KapStone stockholders upon completion of the KapStone
merger will have different rights than holders of KapStone shares.

Upon completion of the KapStone merger, KapStone stockholders receiving the KapStone stock
consideration will become Holdco stockholders, and their rights will continue to be governed by Delaware law,
including the DGCL, and will be governed by the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdco that will be
in effect immediately following the mergers (referred to as the Holdco charter and Holdco bylaws, respectively).
The rights associated with KapStone shares are different from the rights associated with Holdco shares. See the
section entitled “Comparison of Rights of Holdco Stockholders and KapStone Stockholders”, beginning on page
144.

If the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock merger, does not qualify as a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Code, KapStone stockholders receiving Holdco shares in the KapStone merger
may be required to pay substantial incremental U.S. federal income taxes.

As a condition to the completion of the KapStone merger, Sidley, tax counsel to KapStone, or another
nationally recognized law firm, must have delivered an opinion, dated as of the effective time, to the effect that
the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock merger, should be treated as a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Code. The opinion will assume that the mergers will be completed according to
the terms of the merger agreement and that the parties will report the transactions in a manner consistent with the
opinion. The opinion will rely on the facts as stated in the merger agreement, the Registration Statement on Form
S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and certain other documents. In rendering the tax
opinion, Sidley (or another nationally recognized law firm) will require and rely on representations of KapStone
and WestRock to be delivered at the time of closing (and will assume that any such representation that is qualified
by belief, knowledge or materiality is true, correct and complete without such qualification). If any such
assumption or representation is or becomes inaccurate, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the KapStone
merger could be adversely affected. The opinion will be based on statutory, regulatory and judicial authority
existing as of the date of the opinion, any of which may be changed at any time with retroactive effect. An
opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment but is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service
(referred to as the IRS) or on any court. KapStone does not intend to request any ruling from the IRS as to the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the KapStone merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the
IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences set forth in
this proxy statement/prospectus or any of the tax consequences described in the tax opinion. If the IRS were to be
successful in any such contention, or if for any other reason the KapStone merger, when taken together with the
WestRock merger, were not treated as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code, then none of the
KapStone stockholders would be entitled to defer any portion of the gain realized as a result of receiving Holdco
shares in the KapStone merger. Rather, all KapStone stockholders would recognize gain or loss with respect to all
such KapStone shares based on the difference between (A) that stockholder’s tax basis in such KapStone shares
and (B) the aggregate cash and the fair market value of the Holdco shares received. For additional information
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of KapStone shares, see the section entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Mergers to U.S. Holders of KapStone Shares”, beginning on page 83.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KapStone stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the mergers and will exercise
less influence over management.

KapStone stockholders currently have the right to vote for their directors and on other matters affecting
KapStone. When the mergers occur, the Holdco shares that each KapStone stockholder receives in exchange as
KapStone stock consideration will represent a percentage ownership of Holdco that is significantly smaller than
the KapStone stockholder’s percentage ownership of KapStone. Stock elections are subject to proration
procedures that are designed to ensure that the KapStone stock consideration is received in respect of no more
than 25% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. If the mergers
are completed and the maximum stock amount is issued to KapStone stockholders, assuming 97.8 million
KapStone shares are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and 256.5 million WestRock
shares are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, approximately 4.5% of the issued and
outstanding Holdco shares immediately following the effective time of the mergers will be held by former
KapStone stockholders. As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, former KapStone stockholders will
have less influence on the management and policies of Holdco than they now have with respect to KapStone.

The opinions of KapStone’s financial advisors will not be updated to reflect changes in circumstances between
signing of the merger agreement in January 2018 and the completion of the mergers.

KapStone has not obtained updated opinions from its financial advisors as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, and KapStone does not anticipate asking its financial advisors to update their opinions.
Changes in the operations and prospects of KapStone or WestRock, general market and economic conditions and
other factors that may be beyond the control of KapStone or WestRock, and on which KapStone’s financial
advisors’ opinions were based, may significantly alter the trading prices of KapStone shares or WestRock shares
by the time the mergers are completed. The opinions do not speak as of the time the mergers will be completed or
as of any date other than the date on which such opinions were delivered. Because KapStone’s financial advisors
will not be updating their opinions, which were issued in connection with the signing of the merger agreement on
January 28, 2018, the opinions will not address the fairness of the KapStone merger consideration from a
financial point of view at the time the mergers are completed. For a description of the opinions that KapStone
received from its financial advisors, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement  — 
Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors”, beginning on page 64.

Risks Related to the Business of the Combined Company upon Completion of the Mergers

The following risks are only applicable to the extent that KapStone stockholders receive KapStone stock
consideration in connection with the mergers.

The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers.

The success of the mergers will depend on, among other things, the combined company’s ability to combine
the KapStone and WestRock businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated
cost synergies and performance improvements.

However, the combined company must successfully combine the businesses of KapStone and WestRock in a
manner that permits these anticipated cost synergies and performance improvements to be realized. In addition,
the combined company must achieve the anticipated synergies and improvements without adversely affecting
current revenues and investments in future growth. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve
these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to
realize than expected.

The failure to integrate successfully certain businesses and operations of KapStone and WestRock in the
expected time frame may adversely affect the combined company’s future results.

Historically, KapStone and WestRock have operated as independent companies, and they will continue to do
so until the completion of the mergers. The management of the combined company may face significant
challenges in integrating and consolidating certain businesses and the functions of KapStone and WestRock,
integrating their technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing

TABLE OF CONTENTS

differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. The integration may also
be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other
disruptions resulting from the mergers may also disrupt KapStone’s and WestRock’s ongoing businesses or cause
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s
relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and others with whom KapStone and WestRock have business
or other dealings or limit the combined company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers. In
addition, difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of KapStone and WestRock could harm
the reputation of the combined company.

Combining the businesses of KapStone and WestRock may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than
expected, which may adversely affect the combined company’s results and negatively affect the value of
Holdco shares following the mergers.

KapStone and WestRock have entered into the merger agreement because each believes that the mergers will
be beneficial to its respective company and stockholders, and that combining the businesses of KapStone and
WestRock will produce cost synergies and performance improvements. If the combined company is not able to
successfully combine the businesses of KapStone and WestRock in an efficient, effective and timely manner, the
anticipated synergies and improvements of the mergers may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to
realize than expected, and the value of Holdco shares may be affected adversely.

An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have
an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which
may adversely affect the value of Holdco shares after the completion of the mergers.

In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated
benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual synergies, if achieved, may be lower than what
WestRock and Holdco expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If the combined company is not
able to adequately address integration challenges, the combined company may be unable to successfully integrate
KapStone’s and WestRock’s operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two
companies.

KapStone and WestRock will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the mergers.

KapStone and WestRock have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with
the mergers. These costs and expenses include financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other
advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, severance and employee benefit-related
expenses, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. Some of these costs are payable by KapStone
and WestRock regardless of whether the mergers are completed. There is also a large number of processes,
policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the mergers.
While both KapStone and WestRock have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in
connection with the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, there are many
factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation
expenses.

There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the mergers that the
combined company may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income
Holdco expects to achieve from the mergers. Although Holdco expects that these benefits will offset the
transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this expected net benefit may not be achieved in the
near term or at all.

The combined company expects to have additional indebtedness following the mergers and the credit ratings
of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from current ratings and what WestRock and
KapStone currently expect.

WestRock expects to incur additional indebtedness in order to finance the KapStone cash consideration and
pay other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the mergers and related

• making it more difficult for the combined company to satisfy its debt service obligations;

• requiring the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to debt service
obligations, thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general operating
requirements;

• limiting the ability of the combined company to obtain additional financing to fund its working capital
requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service obligations and other general
operating requirements;

• restricting the combined company from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable
business opportunities;

• placing the combined company at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that
have less debt;

• limiting flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the businesses and industries in which the
combined company operates, which may adversely affect the combined company’s operating results
and ability to meet its debt service obligations;

• increasing the vulnerability of the combined company to adverse general economic and industry
conditions, including changes in interest rates; and

• limiting the ability of the combined company to refinance its indebtedness or increasing the cost of
such indebtedness.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

transactions. The receipt of financing by WestRock or its affiliates, however, is not a condition to completion of
the mergers. Following completion of the mergers, the combined company will have substantial indebtedness and
the credit ratings of the combined company and its subsidiaries may be different from current WestRock or
KapStone ratings and what WestRock and KapStone currently expect. Any new indebtedness may adversely
affect the business, financial condition and operating results of the combined company, including:

If Holdco incurs additional indebtedness following the mergers, the risks related to the substantial
indebtedness of Holdco may intensify.

Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with WestRock or KapStone.

Each of WestRock and KapStone has contracts with customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, licensors and
other business partners which may require WestRock or KapStone, as applicable, to obtain consent from these
other parties in connection with the mergers. If these consents cannot be obtained, the combined company may
suffer a loss of potential future revenue and may lose rights that are material to its business. In addition, third
parties with which WestRock or KapStone currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the
scope of their relationships with either or both parties in anticipation of the mergers, or with the combined
company following the mergers. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company’s ability to achieve the
anticipated benefits of the mergers. The adverse effect of such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in
the completion of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement.

Risks Related to KapStone’s Business

You should read and consider risk factors specific to KapStone’s businesses that will also affect the
combined company after the completion of the mergers. These risks are described in Part I, Item 1A of
KapStone’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, in Part II, Item 1A of

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Any statements in this proxy statement/prospectus about KapStone’s, WestRock’s or Holdco’s expectations,
beliefs, plans or forecasts, including statements regarding the mergers, the expected timetable for completing the
mergers, benefits and synergies of the mergers and future opportunities for the combined company and products
and services, that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or
phrases such as “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”,
“intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “target”, “prospects”, “potential” and “forecast”, and other words, terms and phrases
of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, expectations, projections, goals, forecasts,
assumptions, risks and uncertainties. KapStone, WestRock and Holdco caution readers that any forward-looking
statement is not a guarantee of future performance, and that actual results could differ materially from those
contained in the forward-looking statement. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are the following: the parties’ ability to
consummate the mergers; the satisfaction of the conditions to the completion of the mergers, including the receipt
of the KapStone stockholder approval; the regulatory approvals required for the mergers may not be obtained on
the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of
conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the mergers); the
parties’ ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the
mergers; the possibility that the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies
within the expected time-frames or at all and to successfully integrate KapStone’s operations with those of
WestRock; such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs,
customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with
employees, customers, clients or suppliers) may be greater than expected following the mergers; WestRock and
KapStone are subject to intense competition and increased competition is expected in the future; fluctuations in
foreign currencies could result in losses and increased expenses relating to the mergers; risks relating to the value
of the Holdco shares that may be issued in the mergers; the ability of KapStone and the combined company to
retain and hire key personnel; and general economic conditions that are less favorable than expected. Such risks
and other factors that may impact management’s assumptions are more particularly described in KapStone’s and
WestRock’s filings with the SEC, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in KapStone’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, “Risk Factors” in KapStone’s Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, “Business — Forward-Looking
Information” and “Risk Factors” in WestRock’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. The information contained
herein speaks as of the date hereof and none of KapStone, WestRock or Holdco have or undertake any obligation
to update or revise their forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

As of the close of business on the record date, there were issued and outstanding a total of 97,840,381
KapStone shares entitled to vote at the KapStone special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date,
approximately 10.2% of the issued and outstanding KapStone shares were held by KapStone directors, executive
officers and their affiliates.

KapStone currently expects that its directors and executive officers will vote their KapStone shares in favor
of the KapStone merger proposal, the KapStone adjournment proposal and the KapStone compensation proposal.
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement on January 28, 2018, as inducement for WestRock to
enter into the merger agreement, WestRock entered into separate voting agreements with Roger W. Stone,
Executive Chairman of the KapStone board, and certain affiliated entities, which together beneficially owned
shares totaling approximately 5.9% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of January 28, 2018 (which
includes KapStone options that were exercisable and KapStone RSUs that would vest within 60 days of
January 28, 2018) and owned, with the right to vote at the KapStone special meeting, 5.2% of the KapStone
shares issued and outstanding as of the record date (which does not include KapStone options that are exercisable
or KapStone RSUs that will vest within 60 days of the record date), and with Matthew Kaplan, KapStone’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, who beneficially owned shares totaling approximately 3.6% of the
KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of January 28, 2018 (which includes KapStone options that were
exercisable and KapStone RSUs that would vest within 60 days of January 28, 2018) and owned, with the right to
vote at the KapStone special meeting, 2.9% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding as of the record date
(which does not include KapStone options that are exercisable or KapStone RSUs that will vest within 60 days of
the record date). Each of Messrs. Stone and Kaplan agreed during the term of his respective voting agreement to,
among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions therein, (i) vote all the KapStone shares that he

beneficially owns in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any alternative transaction that
may be proposed, (ii) not solicit alternative transactions or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
alternative transactions, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) subject to certain exceptions, will not
sell or otherwise transfer his KapStone shares.

Quorum
A quorum is necessary to transact business at the KapStone special meeting. A quorum for action on any

subject matter at any special meeting of KapStone stockholders will exist when the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding KapStone shares entitled to vote on such subject matter are represented in person or by
proxy at such meeting. KapStone shares represented at the KapStone special meeting but not voted, including
KapStone shares for which a stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted as present for
purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as present for purposes of
establishing a quorum. KapStone shares owned by KapStone as treasury shares will not be included in the
calculation of the number of KapStone shares represented at the KapStone special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present.

Required Vote
Completion of the mergers is conditioned on the KapStone stockholder approval. Assuming a quorum is

present, the KapStone stockholder approval requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the KapStone
shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the KapStone merger proposal. Assuming a quorum is
present, approval of the KapStone adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the KapStone shares present in person or represented by proxy at the KapStone special meeting and entitled to
vote on the KapStone adjournment proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the KapStone
compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the KapStone shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the KapStone special meeting and entitled to vote on the KapStone
compensation proposal.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
If you are a KapStone stockholder and fail to vote, fail to instruct your broker or nominee to vote, or vote to

abstain, it will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the KapStone merger proposal. If you are a KapStone
stockholder and fail to vote or fail to instruct your broker or nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the
KapStone adjournment proposal or the KapStone compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you
are a KapStone stockholder and you mark your proxy card or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect
of a vote “AGAINST” the KapStone adjournment proposal and the KapStone compensation proposal.

Voting in Person
If you plan to attend the KapStone special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at

the KapStone special meeting. If your KapStone shares are held in “street name”, and you wish to vote your
KapStone shares in person at the KapStone special meeting, you must bring to the KapStone special meeting a
“legal proxy” executed in your favor from the record holder (your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee)
of the KapStone shares authorizing you to vote at the KapStone special meeting.

In addition, you may be asked to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport,
before being admitted to the KapStone special meeting. If you hold your KapStone shares in “street name”, you
also may be asked to present proof of ownership to be admitted to the KapStone special meeting. A brokerage
statement or letter from your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee proving ownership of the KapStone
shares on the record date are examples of proof of ownership. KapStone stockholders will not be allowed to use
cameras, recording devices and other similar electronic devices at the KapStone special meeting.

Voting of Proxies
A proxy card is enclosed for your use. KapStone requests that you mark, sign and date the accompanying

proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope so that it is received by the

• by sending a notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of KapStone, dated as of a later date than
the date of the proxy card and received by the Corporate Secretary of KapStone prior to the KapStone
special meeting;

• by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card and mailing it so
that it is received by the Corporate Secretary of KapStone prior to the KapStone special meeting; or

• by attending the KapStone special meeting and voting in person.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Corporate Secretary of KapStone prior to the KapStone special meeting. When the accompanying proxy card is
returned properly executed, the KapStone shares represented by it will be voted at the KapStone special meeting
or any adjournment thereof in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy card.

If a signed proxy card is returned without an indication as to how the KapStone shares represented are to be
voted with regard to a particular proposal, the KapStone shares represented by the proxy will be voted “FOR”
each such proposal.

At the date hereof, management has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for consideration at
the KapStone special meeting and which would be required to be set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus or
the related KapStone proxy card other than the matters set forth in KapStone’s Notice of Special Meeting of
Stockholders. If any other matter is properly presented at the KapStone special meeting for consideration, the
enclosed proxies will confer discretionary authority on the individuals named in the proxies to vote the KapStone
shares represented by the proxies as to any other matters. The individuals named as proxies intend to vote in
accordance with their best judgment as to any other matters.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card
whether or not you plan to attend the KapStone special meeting in person.

How Proxies Are Counted

All KapStone shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the KapStone special
meeting will be voted at the KapStone special meeting in the manner specified by the KapStone stockholder
giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions with respect to the
KapStone merger proposal, the KapStone adjournment proposal or the KapStone compensation proposal will be
voted as recommended by the KapStone board, which is a vote “FOR” each such proposal.

Voting of KapStone Shares Held in “Street Name”

If you hold KapStone shares through a broker or other nominee, you may instruct your broker or other
nominee to vote your KapStone shares by following the instructions that the broker or nominee provides to you
with these materials. Most brokers offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail by
completing a voting instruction card, by telephone and via the Internet. Broker non-votes, if any, will not be
counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote
“AGAINST” the KapStone merger proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the KapStone adjournment
proposal or the KapStone compensation proposal. If your KapStone shares are held in “street name”, and you
wish to vote your KapStone shares in person at the KapStone special meeting, you must bring to the KapStone
special meeting a “legal proxy” executed in your favor from the record holder (your broker, bank, trust company
or other nominee) of the KapStone shares authorizing you to vote at the KapStone special meeting.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a KapStone Stockholder’s Vote

You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the KapStone special meeting. You may
do this in one of four ways:

Your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Written notices of revocation and other communications about revoking KapStone proxies should be
addressed to:

KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation 
1101 Skokie Boulevard, Suite 300 

Northbrook, IL 60062 
Attn: Kathryn D. Ingraham, Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel

If your KapStone shares are held in “street name”, you should follow the instructions of your broker
regarding the revocation of proxies.

Once voting on a particular matter is completed at the KapStone special meeting, a KapStone stockholder
will not be able to revoke its proxy or change its vote as to that matter.

All KapStone shares represented by valid proxies that KapStone receives through this solicitation and that
are not revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card. If a KapStone stockholder
makes no specifications on its proxy card as to how it should want its KapStone shares voted before signing and
returning it, such proxy will be voted as recommended by the KapStone board, which is “FOR” the KapStone
merger proposal, “FOR” the KapStone adjournment proposal and “FOR” the KapStone compensation proposal.

Tabulation of Votes

The KapStone board has appointed a representative of Morrow Sodali LLC to serve as the inspector of
election for the KapStone special meeting. The inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the
number of KapStone shares represented at the KapStone special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum,
determine the validity of all proxies and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to the
KapStone stockholders.

Solicitation of Proxies

KapStone will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from its stockholders, except that KapStone and
WestRock have agreed to each pay one half of the costs and expenses of printing and mailing this proxy
statement/prospectus and all filing and other similar fees payable to the SEC in connection with this proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, KapStone will request that banks, brokers
and other record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of KapStone shares and secure
their voting instructions, if necessary. KapStone will reimburse the record holders for their reasonable expenses
in taking those actions.

KapStone has also made arrangements with Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in soliciting proxies and in
communicating with KapStone stockholders. KapStone will pay Morrow Sodali LLC a fee of  $10,000, $5,000 of
which, and an advance against disbursements in the amount of  $7,500 will be paid prior to the conclusion of the
solicitation, with the remaining balance to become payable upon the conclusion of the solicitation. KapStone will
also pay Morrow Sodali LLC a fee of  $2,500, plus related travel expenses, for providing inspector services at the
KapStone special meeting. If necessary, KapStone may also use several of its employees, who will not be
specially compensated, to solicit proxies from KapStone stockholders, either personally or by telephone, the
Internet, facsimile or letter.

Adjournments

If a quorum is not present or represented, a meeting of KapStone stockholders may be adjourned for such
periods as the presiding officer of the meeting or the stockholders holding a majority of the KapStone shares
present in person or by proxy at the KapStone special meeting and entitled to vote on the KapStone adjournment
proposal shall direct. If a quorum is present at the KapStone special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at
the time of the KapStone special meeting to approve the KapStone merger proposal, then KapStone stockholders
may be asked to vote on the KapStone adjournment proposal. Notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting
if the date, hour and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the
KapStone board sets a new record date for such meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be
given to each holder of record of KapStone shares entitled to

vote thereon. At any subsequent reconvening of the KapStone special meeting at which a quorum is present, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted
in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the KapStone special meeting,
except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the
reconvened meeting.

PROPOSAL 1: 
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Effects of the Mergers

At the effective time, WestRock Merger Sub will be merged with and into WestRock, with WestRock
surviving the WestRock merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (referred to as the WestRock surviving
company), and immediately following the WestRock merger, KapStone Merger Sub will be merged with and into
KapStone, with KapStone surviving the KapStone merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (referred to as
the KapStone surviving company). As a result, among other things, Holdco will become the ultimate parent of
WestRock, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, KapStone stockholders will have the right to elect to receive with respect to each KapStone share they
hold (other than KapStone shares in respect of which a KapStone stockholder has properly demanded appraisal
rights in accordance with the DGCL), subject to certain proration procedures described below, either: (1) $35.00
in cash, without interest thereon, or (2) 0.4981 Holdco shares, with cash paid in lieu of fractional Holdco shares.
At the effective time, and without any action on the part of WestRock, Holdco, the WestRock surviving company
or the holders of WestRock shares, Holdco shares or capital stock of the WestRock surviving company, each
issued and outstanding WestRock share will be converted into one Holdco share.

Under the merger agreement, the maximum stock amount, which is the maximum number of Holdco shares
that may be issued as stock consideration, is equal to (i) 25% of the product of  (A) 0.4981 and (B) the number of
issued and outstanding KapStone shares immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) rounded down to the nearest
whole number. Therefore, stock elections are subject to proration procedures. See the sections entitled “— The
Merger Agreement — Proration Procedures”, beginning on page 103, and “— The Merger Agreement — Election
Procedures”, beginning on page 102.

The table below demonstrates the potential effects of the proration procedures on what a hypothetical holder
of 100 KapStone shares would receive if such holder elected to receive the KapStone stock consideration for all
of its KapStone shares.

25% 100 0 49 $ 0.00
20% 100 0 49 $ 0.00

The merger agreement does not contain any provision that would adjust the exchange ratio based on
fluctuations in the market value of either KapStone shares or WestRock shares. Because of this, the implied value
of the KapStone stock consideration will fluctuate between now and the completion of the mergers. The value of
the KapStone stock consideration depends on the market value of Holdco shares at the time the mergers are
completed, which will in turn be affected by the market value of KapStone shares and WestRock shares at the
time the mergers are completed.

Background of the Mergers

From time to time, the KapStone board, in consultation with senior management of KapStone and
KapStone’s advisors, has reviewed KapStone’s strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and

potential strategic combinations with parties operating in KapStone’s same or a similar industry. On January 21,
2016, an industry participant (referred to as Party A) indicated to Mr. Matthew Kaplan, KapStone’s current
President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Roger Stone, the current Executive Chairman of the KapStone
board, a desire to enter into discussions regarding a potential business combination with KapStone. In February
of 2016, Mr. Kaplan met with representatives of Party A. KapStone and Party A entered into a non-disclosure and
standstill agreement on March 29, 2016 and engaged in intermittent discussions throughout March and April of
2016. On April 20, 2016, representatives of Party A orally communicated to Mr. Kaplan an offer for KapStone of
less than $18.00 per KapStone share. Over the next several months, Mr. Kaplan and representatives of Party A
engaged in intermittent discussions. In the first half of 2017, representatives of Party A orally communicated to
Mr. Kaplan an offer for KapStone of  $25.00 per KapStone share. The KapStone board determined that it was not
in the best interests of KapStone stockholders to pursue a transaction with Party A.

In November of 2016, representatives of Moelis contacted KapStone indicating that another industry
participant (referred to as Party B) had an interest in discussing the possibility of a potential business combination
with KapStone, and subsequently representatives of Party B, KapStone and Moelis met, although Party B did not
provide any indication of interest or proposal to KapStone at such time.

In October of 2017, representatives of Party B contacted representatives of Rothschild and indicated an
interest in meeting with KapStone to discuss the possibility of a potential business combination with KapStone.
Representatives of Rothschild then contacted representatives of KapStone’s senior management, indicated that
Party B had made such an unsolicited outreach to Rothschild, and offered to, on behalf of KapStone, arrange a
meeting between representatives of KapStone and representatives of Party B.

On November 9, 2017, Mr. Steve Voorhees, the President and Chief Executive Officer of WestRock,
contacted Mr. Kaplan indicating that WestRock was interested in a potential business combination with
KapStone, and asked to meet with representatives of KapStone.

On November 10, 2017, representatives of Party B met with representatives of Rothschild and KapStone’s
management, including Mr. Kaplan, and discussed developments in the industry generally and indicated an
interest in discussing further a potential business combination with KapStone. Mr. Kaplan indicated he would
communicate any such offer from Party B to the KapStone board for its consideration.

On November 16, 2017, Mr. Voorhees and Mr. James Porter, the President of Business Development and
Latin America of WestRock, met with Messrs. Kaplan and Stone. During this meeting, Messrs. Voorhees and
Porter indicated that WestRock was interested in pursuing a potential business combination with KapStone and
discussed WestRock’s vision for the combined companies. Mr. Kaplan indicated that he would communicate any
such offer from WestRock to the KapStone board for its consideration.

On December 4, 2017, WestRock submitted an initial due diligence request list to KapStone.

During early December of 2017, Mr. Kaplan reported his discussions with Party B and WestRock to
Mr. Stone and to Mr. Brian Gamache, the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the
KapStone board. Each of them agreed with Mr. Kaplan that KapStone should enter into non-disclosure
agreements with Party B and WestRock to facilitate the exchange of information.

During late November and early December of 2017, representatives of KapStone and representatives of each
of Party B and WestRock negotiated non-disclosure and standstill agreements in order to facilitate the exchange
of certain non-public and confidential information. KapStone executed a non-disclosure and standstill agreement
with Party B dated as of December 8, 2017, and with WestRock dated as of December 14, 2017, which agreement
with WestRock was subsequently amended by an amendment dated as of December 29, 2017 to provide for
certain procedures with respect to potentially competitively sensitive information. The agreements each contained
“fall-away provisions” such that, if KapStone executed a change of control agreement with a third party, the
counterparty to the NDA would be permitted to make private proposals to KapStone.

On December 12, 2017, representatives of Party B toured KapStone’s mill in Charleston, South Carolina. On
December 13, 2017, representatives of senior management of Party B and its financial advisor met with
Mr. Kaplan, other members of KapStone senior management and representatives of Rothschild,

during which meeting Party B provided KapStone with an overview of its business, and provided KapStone with
a written non-binding indication of interest and orally provided a price range to acquire KapStone for $25.00 to
$28.00 in cash per KapStone share. Mr. Kaplan responded that he would inform the KapStone board of Party B’s
indication of interest.

On December 14, 2017, representatives of WestRock met with representatives of KapStone management,
during which meeting representatives of WestRock confirmed their interest in pursuing a potential business
combination with KapStone and provided KapStone with a detailed overview of WestRock’s diligence requests
and a general discussion with respect thereto. Mr. Kaplan indicated he would inform the KapStone board of
WestRock’s interest.

On December 15, 2017, the KapStone board held a regularly scheduled meeting in person at which members
of senior management were in attendance. During an executive session of the KapStone board, participated in by
Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Kathryn Ingraham, KapStone’s Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel,
Ms. Ingraham provided an overview of the fiduciary duties of the KapStone board under Delaware law, and
Mr. Kaplan discussed with the KapStone board the communications by Party B and WestRock, indicating each
was interested in engaging in a potential business combination transaction with KapStone, including that Party B
had orally provided a price range to acquire KapStone for $25.00 to $28.00 in cash per KapStone share.
Discussion ensued regarding Party B’s financial ability to accomplish such a transaction. The KapStone board
then engaged in a discussion regarding factors relevant to determining whether to explore a potential sale of
KapStone, including external factors such as the current state of the industry (including the view of management
that beyond 2019 the industry may encounter challenges, including as a result of the expectation of additional
production capacity to be provided from existing and new industry participants) and internal factors, including
the condition of KapStone’s plants and mills and capital expenditures necessary to maintain KapStone’s
competitive position, factors related to KapStone’s liquidity and capital resources (including higher and likely
rising interest rates and current leverage ratio) and factors related to senior management succession planning.
Following this discussion, the KapStone board authorized management to share information on a confidential
basis with WestRock and Party B, to engage an economist to prepare an antitrust analysis, and to update
KapStone’s 2018 budget (which, as finalized as described below, is the 2018 Operating Plan (as defined under
“Proposal 1: The Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Certain KapStone Forecasts”, beginning on page 96)) to
reflect the KapStone board’s review and discussion of the 2018 budget at that meeting. The KapStone board also
authorized management to begin discussions with financial advisors in connection with potentially engaging such
advisors regarding pursuing a potential business combination transaction.

On December 22, 2017, the KapStone board held a special meeting at which members of senior
management were in attendance. Ms. Ingraham provided an overview of the fiduciary duties of the KapStone
board under Delaware law. Mr. Kaplan then led a discussion regarding KapStone’s capital plan for the next
five years (referred to as the capital plan), and Mr. Kaplan and other members of senior management answered
questions from the KapStone board about the assumptions made and methodologies used in preparing the capital
plan. Management then reviewed and discussed KapStone’s revised 2018 Operating Plan including the
assumptions made therein. Management indicated that, consistent with prior direction from the KapStone board,
the revised 2018 Operating Plan did not reflect any change in containerboard pricing for 2018, and also did not
reflect the potential impact of changes to federal tax laws. Next, the KapStone board discussed potentially
engaging each of Rothschild and Moelis as financial advisors. Ms. Ingraham reviewed the disclosures of
Rothschild and Moelis regarding the absence of any potential conflicts of interest that could arise if KapStone
engaged each financial advisor in connection with a potential business combination transaction with certain
counterparties (as further described under “Proposal 1: The Adoption of the Merger Agreement — KapStone’s
Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the KapStone Board of Directors”, beginning on page 58). The
KapStone board concluded that, based upon the information provided by Rothschild and Moelis, neither had any
relationships that would be likely to impair their ability to provide independent advice or an independent fairness
opinion and authorized management to engage Rothschild and Moelis on the terms presented at the meeting, and
that given each of Rothschild’s and Moelis’s respective contacts in the industry and respective insights with
respect to KapStone and its evaluation of strategic alternatives, it was in the best interests of KapStone to engage
both financial advisors. The KapStone board then approved making available on a confidential basis to Party B
and WestRock the capital plan and revised 2018 Operating Plan.

• did not permit KapStone to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal;

• provided for a termination fee to be payable by KapStone equal to 4.0% of the aggregate equity value
of KapStone under certain circumstances, including if the KapStone board changed its recommendation
to KapStone stockholders with respect to the transaction; and

• provided that WestRock would not be required to take any divestiture action to obtain regulatory
approval if all such actions in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on WestRock, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries taken as a whole (measuring such
companies as a whole as though they were the size of KapStone and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Later on December 22, 2017, acting at the direction of the KapStone board, KapStone opened an online
virtual data room to representatives of WestRock providing limited information, including the capital plan and
2018 Operating Plan, in response to an initial due diligence request list submitted by WestRock, and opened an
online virtual data room to Party B containing the capital plan and 2018 Operating Plan.

Over the course of the next several weeks, each of Party B and WestRock, and their respective advisors,
engaged in preliminary financial and business due diligence and representatives of KapStone continued to
provide additional due diligence information in response to further due diligence requests.

On January 4, 2018, representatives of Party B met with Messrs. Matt Kaplan and Randy Nebel, Executive
Vice President of Integrated Packaging at KapStone, during which representatives of Party B reiterated their
interest in engaging in a business combination transaction with KapStone. Mr. Kaplan indicated he would
communicate any revised offer from Party B to the KapStone board for its consideration.

On January 10, 2018, Party B provided KapStone with a written non-binding indication of interest to acquire
KapStone for $30.00 to $33.00 in cash per KapStone share. The indication of interest indicated that Party B
would finance the potential transaction with $2.3 billion of debt with recourse solely to KapStone’s assets, cash
on hand and additional debt facilities with recourse to Party B’s assets. It also indicated the potential transaction
would be subject to certain regulatory approvals and approval by Party B’s shareholders. The indication of
interest also stated that Party B believed it would be in a position to sign definitive agreements for a potential
transaction within six to eight weeks and believed it would be able to close a potential transaction within four to
six months after signing. Party B also provided letters from two financial institutions indicating that each such
institution was highly confident that it would be able to provide acquisition financing to Party B to finance a
potential business combination between Party B and KapStone. Mr. Kaplan communicated to Party B that he
would share the indication of interest with the KapStone board.

On January 12, 2018, Mr. Voorhees and Mr. Robert McIntosh, the Executive Vice President, General
Counsel and Corporate Secretary of WestRock, met with Messrs. Stone and Kaplan and Ms. Ingraham. During
the meeting, Mr. Voorhees provided KapStone with an overview of its business, and provided KapStone with a
written non-binding indication of interest to acquire KapStone for $17.40 in cash and 0.170 WestRock shares per
KapStone share, which, based on a closing stock price of WestRock shares of $68.26 on January 11, 2018,
represented an implied offer per KapStone share of  $29.00. The indication of interest noted that any potential
transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions, but would not include a financing condition, and
would not require approval of WestRock’s stockholders. The indication of interest also stated that WestRock
expected to sign a definitive agreement by January 29, 2018. Mr. Kaplan communicated to WestRock that he
would share the indication of interest with the KapStone board.

On January 15, 2018, KapStone executed engagement letters with Rothschild and Moelis formally engaging
them as KapStone’s financial advisors in connection with a potential business combination.

Also on January 15, 2018, Mr. McIntosh delivered a draft merger agreement to KapStone reflecting the
terms of the written non-binding indication of interest delivered by Mr. Voorhees on January 12, 2018. The
merger agreement, among other terms and conditions:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On January 16, 2018, the KapStone board held a special meeting at which members of senior management,
representatives of Rothschild, representatives of Moelis and representatives of Sidley Austin LLP (referred to as
Sidley), KapStone’s outside legal counsel, were in attendance. Representatives of Sidley reviewed with the
KapStone board their fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of a potential business combination
transaction and other legal considerations in connection with a potential business combination transaction.
Mr. Kaplan then led a discussion regarding discussions that had taken place between KapStone and each of Party
B and WestRock since the December 22nd KapStone board meeting, including a discussion regarding the written
non-binding indications of interest provided by each party, copies of which had been provided to the Board. Next,
members of management discussed with the KapStone board the KapStone forecasts that management was
preparing. The discussion included the methodologies being used by KapStone management and key
assumptions. Management also noted that because of the potential for a containerboard price increase,
management was preparing two forecast cases — one that included the effects of such a price increase and one
that did not. Representatives of Rothschild and Moelis then led a discussion with the KapStone board regarding
existing market and industry conditions and the impact those conditions had on the mergers and acquisitions
market and KapStone’s strategic alternatives, and provided a summary of the non-binding indications of interest
that had been received by KapStone from Party B and WestRock. The KapStone board, management and
KapStone’s advisors also discussed regulatory and financing considerations with respect to WestRock and Party
B, including the significant amount of debt financing that Party B was proposing to incur relative to its cash flows
and net assets. The KapStone board, management and KapStone’s advisors then discussed Party A and other
potentially interested parties should the KapStone board determine to continue exploring a potential transaction.
During this discussion, members of management and representatives of Rothschild and Moelis gave their
perspectives regarding the likely level of interest of other potentially interested parties as well as the ability of
such parties to consummate a transaction. Following this discussion, the KapStone board authorized KapStone’s
management, Rothschild and Moelis to continue discussions with WestRock and Party B regarding a potential
business combination transaction for KapStone. Taking into account the perspectives of management and
KapStone’s financial advisors and the KapStone board’s familiarity with the industry and its participants, as well
as concerns with respect to confidentiality, the KapStone board also directed management of KapStone to contact
Party A to determine whether it was interested in exploring a potential business combination transaction.

On January 17, 2018, Mr. Kaplan contacted representatives of Party A to inquire about Party A’s interest in
exploring a potential business combination with KapStone. Representatives of Party A indicated Party A was
interested in exploring a potential business combination with KapStone and would like to discuss the matter
further, and that Party A would visit KapStone’s headquarters the following day.

Also on January 17, 2018, as directed by the KapStone board, representatives of Rothschild and Moelis
contacted representatives of Party B and WestRock and informed each that KapStone was not willing to engage
in a transaction based on the terms proposed by each, but that KapStone remained interested in continuing to
explore a potential business combination and would be expanding the number of parties with which KapStone
was discussing a potential business combination.

KapStone and Party A then executed a non-disclosure and standstill agreement dated as of January 18, 2018
in order to facilitate the exchange of certain non-public and confidential information. Similar to the non-
disclosure and standstill agreements with Party B and WestRock, the agreement with Party A included a “fall-
away” provision. Later that day, members of management of KapStone and representatives of Rothschild and
Moelis met with members of management of Party A. Party A’s management reconfirmed its interest in exploring
a potential business combination between the parties and indicated that Party A would be submitting a written
non-binding proposal in the near term.

Over the course of the next several days, WestRock and its advisors engaged in continued financial, business
and legal due diligence and representatives of KapStone continued to provide additional due diligence
information to WestRock and Party B in response to their diligence requests, and Party A continued its due
diligence, including conducting a conference call with KapStone management on January 22, 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On January 22, 2018, Messrs. Voorhees and McIntosh met with Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Ingraham and provided
a revised, written non-binding indication of interest to acquire KapStone for $35.00 in cash per KapStone share.
The proposal also contemplated offering all KapStone stockholders the option to elect to receive Holdco shares in
lieu of cash, based on a fixed exchange ratio to be set at the time of signing of the merger agreement (equal to the
proposed $35.00 cash offer per KapStone share divided by the price per WestRock share based on the last trading
day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement), with such stock consideration capped at 25% of
the aggregate merger consideration. KapStone stockholders wishing to elect to receive Holdco shares would be
required to make such an election by the time of the KapStone special meeting. The written non-binding
indication of interest provided that it would automatically expire, and no longer be valid, if the parties did not
enter into a definitive agreement by 8:30 a.m. Central Time on January 29, 2018. During the conversation,
Mr. Voorhees also indicated that no other offer would be forthcoming and that the offer set forth in the indication
of interest was WestRock’s best and final offer.

Later on January 22, 2018, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, WestRock’s outside legal counsel (referred to as
Cravath), delivered a draft merger agreement to KapStone reflecting the terms of the updated non-binding
indication of interest previously delivered by Mr. Voorhees. The merger agreement, among other terms and
conditions, (a) did not permit KapStone to terminate the merger agreement to consummate or enter into an
agreement in respect of a superior proposal, (b) provided for a termination fee equal to 4.0% of the equity value
of KapStone to be payable by KapStone under certain circumstances, including if the KapStone board changed its
recommendation to KapStone stockholders with respect to the transaction and (c) provided that WestRock would
not be required to take any divestiture action to obtain regulatory approval if all such actions in the aggregate
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on WestRock, KapStone and their respective
subsidiaries (but measuring all such entities in the aggregate as though they were the size of KapStone and its
subsidiaries).

On January 23, 2018, Party A submitted a written non-binding proposal to acquire KapStone for $32.25 in
cash per KapStone share. The proposal stated that (a) the transaction would be financed via a combination of a
rights offering to existing shareholders of Party A and new debt facilities, both of which would be fully
underwritten by major international banks, (b) the transaction would be subject to approval by Party A’s
shareholders and (c) Party A would be willing to agree to a “hell or high water”standard for any required antitrust
approvals. Party A provided letters from two financial institutions each indicating that such financial institution
was highly confident that it would be able to provide an underwriting commitment in respect of an equity
issuance by Party A to fund a portion of the purchase price to be paid in connection with a potential business
combination transaction with KapStone, and one of the institutions also indicated that it was highly confident it
would also be able to provide acquisition debt financing in connection with a potential business combination
transaction with KapStone. The written non-binding proposal also stated that Party A would need six weeks to
conduct due diligence prior to entering into a definitive merger agreement, and was made on the basis that each
party commit to a period of exclusivity to enable completion of due diligence and entry into a definitive merger
agreement.

On January 23, 2018, a communication was sent by KapStone’s senior management to the members of the
KapStone board containing the indication of interest received from WestRock on January 22, 2018 and the
indication of interest received from Party A on January 23, 2018 and describing the current state of discussions.

Also on January 23, 2018, Cravath provided KapStone with a draft voting agreement which WestRock
contemplated would be signed by Messrs. Stone and Kaplan and certain affiliated entities in connection with the
execution of any merger agreement between WestRock and KapStone.

On January 24, 2018, Mr. Kaplan spoke with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A. Mr. Kaplan informed
Party A that its proposed price was meaningfully lower than the highest bid that KapStone had received, and that
Party A would also need to improve its proposed timing to signing if it wished to remain competitive. The Party
A CEO indicated that while Party A may be able to move more quickly, it was unlikely that Party A would be
able to increase its price. Also on January 24, 2018, representatives of Rothschild and Moelis engaged in a
discussion with a senior representative of Party A. During this conversation Party A’s representative noted that
although Party A may be able to increase its price slightly

and move more quickly, it would not be willing to do so without receiving specific price guidance, and indicated
that Party A would not be able to respond regarding any potential increase in price until after receiving an update
regarding the results of the next meeting of the KapStone board. Party A also reiterated to representatives of
Rothschild and Moelis, however, that Party A had attempted to “put their best foot forward” in their initial non-
binding indication of interest. Representatives of Rothschild and Moelis indicated to Party A that KapStone
would not provide specific price guidance, but noted that Party A’s bid was meaningfully lower than the highest
bid received by KapStone and that Party A would need to move more quickly in light of where things stood with
other potentially interested parties.

Later on January 24, 2018, representatives of Sidley engaged in a discussion with representatives of Cravath
regarding the draft merger agreement provided by Cravath.

On January 25, 2018, the KapStone board held a special meeting at which members of senior management,
representatives of Rothschild, representatives of Moelis and representatives of Sidley were in attendance.
Mr. Kaplan briefed the KapStone board regarding the most recent written non-binding proposals received from
Party A, Party B and WestRock. Mr. Kaplan and representatives of Rothschild and Moelis summarized for the
KapStone board the conversations that they had with the bidders over the last several days, including the
discussions regarding anticipated timing to be ready to sign a definitive agreement, that Party A indicated its
proposal was made on the basis of the parties agreeing to a period of exclusivity, that WestRock’s proposal
indicated it would terminate if the parties had not signed a definitive agreement by the morning of January 29,
2018 and that Party A had indicated that it may be able to improve its timing and may be able to increase its price
slightly but would require price guidance and an exclusivity period. Representatives of KapStone, Rothschild,
Moelis and the KapStone board also discussed Party B’s ability to finance a potential business combination, that
Party B had not improved its offer and the fact that Party B’s ability to consummate a potential business
combination would be subject to the approval of certain regulatory authorities and Party B’s shareholders.
KapStone’s management discussed with the KapStone board the two sets of projections that management had
prepared — one giving effect to a containerboard price increase in 2018 and another not giving effect to such an
increase. Members of KapStone’s senior management expressed the view that it was more likely than not, in their
opinion, that there would be a containerboard price increase in the industry in 2018. Following discussion, the
KapStone board adopted the 2018 – 2024 forecasts and directed each of Rothschild and Moelis to use the 2018 – 
2024 financial forecasts in their respective financial analyses going forward. During the KapStone board meeting,
it was noted that the 2018 Operating Plan provided to prospective bidders during due diligence did not reflect the
anticipated containerboard price increase. It was noted by KapStone senior management that WestRock had
specifically requested a financial model that did not include a price increase, and that given the other bidders’
knowledge of the industry, the other bidders would have reflected their views regarding any potential
containerboard price increase in their respective financial models and non-binding indications of interest.
Representatives of Rothschild and Moelis then each led the KapStone board through a discussion of their
respective preliminary financial analyses of KapStone, which, as had previously been directed by KapStone
management, were based on the forecasts prior to giving effect to the 2018 containerboard price increase;
however, throughout their presentations, representatives of Rothschild and Moelis provided commentary
regarding the effects of a potential containerboard price increase on their respective financial analyses. In
response to questions from members of the KapStone board, representatives of Moelis discussed the low
likelihood that there were any other potential parties who had not been contacted and who would be willing to
pay more for KapStone than the $35.00 in cash per KapStone share being offered by WestRock, or that WestRock
would offer more consideration. Representatives of Sidley then reviewed with the KapStone board the material
terms of the draft merger agreement and voting agreements provided by WestRock’s legal counsel (including the
fact that the draft merger agreement (a) did not permit KapStone to terminate the merger agreement to
consummate or enter into an agreement in respect of a superior proposal, (b) provided for a termination fee equal
to 4.0% of the equity value of KapStone to be payable by KapStone under certain circumstances, including if the
KapStone board changed its recommendation to KapStone stockholders with respect to the transaction and
(c) provided that WestRock would not be required to take any divestiture action to obtain regulatory approval if
all such actions in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on WestRock,
KapStone and their respective subsidiaries (but measuring all such entities in the aggregate as though they were
the size of KapStone and its subsidiaries)), and the current status of the antitrust

• the right of KapStone to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal under certain
circumstances;

• a reduction in the termination fee payable by KapStone in the event that KapStone were to terminate
the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal from 4.0% to 3.0% of the aggregate equity value
of KapStone; and

• a commitment by WestRock to take certain actions in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.

regulatory analysis. The KapStone board, management and KapStone’s advisors discussed potential positions
regarding the key terms of the merger agreement and the voting agreements. The KapStone board then authorized
management and other representatives of KapStone, to engage in negotiations with representatives of WestRock
regarding the merger agreement provided by WestRock consistent with the positions discussed by the KapStone
board, management and KapStone’s advisors, including with respect to the efforts required to be used by each
party to obtain clearance from regulatory authorities to consummate the mergers and with respect to the ability of
the KapStone board to consider and negotiate alternative acquisition proposals after execution of a merger
agreement with WestRock. The KapStone board also directed management to contact Party A to attempt to elicit
an improved offer from them. The KapStone board also determined that in light of the regulatory and financing
risks associated with Party B, management did not need to solicit an improved offer from Party B.

Later that evening, at the direction of the KapStone board, representatives of Rothschild and Moelis
communicated to Party A that the KapStone board was continuing to evaluate the proposals it had received and
that it was not able to provide valuation guidance or exclusivity and that Party A would need to increase its price
and commit to working to execute a definitive agreement with respect to a potential business combination with
KapStone more quickly than Party A had previously indicated, in order to be competitive with another proposal
received by KapStone.

On January 26, 2018, another industry participant announced a $50.00 per ton containerboard price increase,
and later that day KapStone also announced a $50.00 per ton containerboard price increase.

Also on January 26, 2018, representatives of Party A indicated to Messrs. Kaplan and Stone that Party A
was not willing to submit a revised proposal in light of the timeframe in which KapStone was proceeding and the
fact that another bidder existed at a higher price and was further along in its work, unless Party A was provided
“deal protection” (which was confirmed to be a request for KapStone to engage in exclusive negotiations with
Party A). In a subsequent discussion, representatives of Rothschild and Moelis inquired of representatives of
Party A as to whether Party A needed any additional information to finalize its views on valuation, to which
representatives of Party A indicated there was not any such information that they still needed. Party A also
indicated that the containerboard price increase announced earlier that day had been factored into its bid.
Representatives of Rothschild and Moelis reiterated that KapStone would not provide specific valuation guidance
to Party A or be able to offer exclusivity. The representatives of Party A indicated that Party A would not be able
to increase its offer price or move much more quickly than previously indicated.

Later on January 26, 2018, Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Ingraham met with Messrs. Voorhees and McIntosh. During
the course of the meeting the parties negotiated resolution of various deal terms, including:

Over the course of the next two days, representatives of Sidley and Cravath negotiated the remaining terms
of the merger agreement (including with respect to the scope of the representations and warranties to be made by
KapStone and the scope of KapStone’s non-solicitation obligations with respect to acquisition proposals) and
exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and related disclosure letters. During this time, WestRock and its
advisors engaged in continued confirmatory financial, business and legal due diligence and representatives of
KapStone continued to provide additional due diligence information to WestRock. Representatives of Cravath
and Sidley also negotiated the terms of the voting agreements to be signed by each of Messrs. Kaplan and Stone
and certain affiliated entities.

On January 28, 2018, the KapStone board held a special meeting in person at which members of KapStone’s
senior management, representatives of Rothschild, representatives of Moelis, and representatives of Sidley were
in attendance. Mr. Kaplan and representatives of Rothschild and Moelis

TABLE OF CONTENTS

updated the KapStone board with respect to communications between KapStone and KapStone’s financial
advisors and each of WestRock, Party A and Party B. As part of the update, representatives of KapStone’s
financial advisors noted that Party A confirmed during their conversations that it was aware that the 2018
Operating Plan did not include a 2018 containerboard price increase and Party A had included its expectations
regarding containerboard price increases into the price it had proposed. They also noted the discussions with
Party A, Party A’s conditions to submitting a revised proposal and that Party A had indicated it was unwilling to
submit a revised proposal because its conditions had not been met. Next, representatives of Sidley briefed the
KapStone board regarding the material terms of the draft merger agreement and the voting agreements that had
been negotiated with WestRock, and the current status of the work undertaken to assess the potential risk of not
receiving the requisite approvals for the transaction from the antitrust regulatory authorities. Representatives of
Sidley further provided a detailed discussion regarding the structure, the regulatory closing conditions and efforts
each party was required to undertake to obtain regulatory approvals, the intended tax treatment of the transaction,
conditions precedent and deal protection terms, highlighting key issues regarding certainty of closing and deal
protection. The KapStone board also discussed with Sidley the factors that the KapStone board had considered in
connection with the evaluation of the potential transaction and the fiduciary obligations of the KapStone board in
connection therewith. Representatives of Rothschild and Moelis then each led a discussion with the KapStone
board regarding the respective financial analyses of KapStone prepared by each financial advisor. Throughout
their respective presentations, representatives of Rothschild and Moelis provided commentary regarding the
effects of the recent containerboard price increase and changes to federal tax laws and related considerations
relative to their respective financial analyses based on the 2018 – 2024 financial forecasts. During the
presentation, members of the KapStone board asked questions which representatives of the financial advisors
answered. In response to questions, representatives of the financial advisors and members of senior management
indicated they did not believe that WestRock or any other potential parties would be willing to pay a price higher
than the $35.00 in cash per KapStone share being offered by WestRock. Following this discussion, (i) a
representative of Rothschild stated Rothschild’s opinion that, as of January 28, 2018 and based on and subject to
the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in Rothschild’s written opinion, dated
the same date, the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the mergers pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, and (ii) a
representative of Moelis stated Moelis’s opinion that, as of January 28, 2018, and based on and subject to the
limitations, conditions, qualifications and assumptions set forth in its written opinion delivered following the
meeting, the cash consideration to be received by KapStone’s stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement is
fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Following meetings of the audit and compensation committees of the KapStone board, Mr. Kaplan then
stated that KapStone’s management recommended that the KapStone board approve the potential transaction with
WestRock, and following discussion, and upon motion duly made and seconded, the KapStone board
unanimously approved the resolutions, among other things, adopting and approving the mergers and the merger
agreement and recommending the mergers to KapStone stockholders for the KapStone stockholders’
consideration and approval.

Late in the evening of January 28, 2018, KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock merger sub and KapStone
merger sub executed the merger agreement, and WestRock, Messrs. Kaplan and Stone, the Roger W. Stone
Revocable Trust and the Roger and Susan Stone Family Foundation executed their respective voting agreements.

Following the execution of the merger agreement, on January 29, 2018, KapStone and WestRock issued a
joint press release announcing the entry into the merger agreement.

• Merger Consideration.   That the KapStone cash consideration represented:

• a 31.9% premium over the closing trading price of KapStone shares on January 26, 2018, the last
trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement;

• a 53.7% premium over the volume-weighted average closing price of KapStone shares reported
for the 30 trading day period ending on January 26, 2018; and

• a 59.9% premium over the volume-weighted average closing price of KapStone shares reported
for the 60 trading day period ending on January 26, 2018.

• Historical Performance, Prospects and Strategic Alternatives.

• The KapStone board considered the current and historical financial condition, results of operations
and business of KapStone, KapStone’s competitive position in the industry and KapStone’s
historical performance relative to other companies in the industry, as well as recent changes in the
industry, including changes to federal tax laws, and KapStone’s then recently announced $50 per
ton containerboard price increase (including the expectation of additional production capacity to
be provided from existing and new industry participants).

• The KapStone board considered the KapStone forecasts (as defined in the section entitled “— 
Certain KapStone Forecasts”) prepared by senior management of KapStone and the risks
associated with the ability of KapStone to meet such projections if it were to continue to operate
as an independent company, including the condition of KapStone’s plants and mills and the level
of capital expenditure investments necessary to remain competitive in the industry, as well as the
uncertainty that may be created by potential executive officer succession actions that may be
necessary in the near to mid-term. The KapStone board also considered KapStone’s actual results
in the past relative to results projected by KapStone’s management.

• In light of the foregoing, the KapStone board considered KapStone’s near-term and longer-term
prospects as an independent company.

• The KapStone board considered the potential strategic alternatives available to KapStone,
including pursuing a standalone strategy and divesting one of its divisions, and the potential
stockholder value that might result from such alternatives.

• The KapStone board considered the feasibility of a divestiture of one of its divisions on attractive
terms in light of the fact that KapStone held discussions with parties interested in buying such
division in the summer of 2017, which did not result in a transaction.

• The KapStone board’s view, taking into account, among other things, its review and discussions
with KapStone’s senior management and advisors regarding potential strategic alternatives for
KapStone, was that other strategic alternatives reviewed by the KapStone board were unlikely to
create greater overall value for KapStone stockholders than the mergers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KapStone’s Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the KapStone Board of Directors

Board Recommendation; Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the KapStone
merger, and making the KapStone recommendation, the KapStone board consulted with KapStone’s senior
management team and outside legal and financial advisors and considered and evaluated numerous factors over
the course of five meetings of the KapStone board beginning December 15, 2017, including the following
material factors, each of which the KapStone board believes supported its unanimous determinations:

58



9/28/2019 tv498833-defm14a - none - 17.573917s

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1325281/000114420418041383/tv498833-defm14a.htm 69/269

• Other Potentially Interested Parties.

• The KapStone board considered the fact that KapStone received proposals from two other
potentially interested parties, including from Party A, the party the KapStone board believed to be
most likely to offer a proposal competitive with WestRock’s offer. The KapStone board considered
the execution risk with respect to Party B’s proposal and the fact that neither Party A nor Party’s
B’s proposal offered a higher price than WestRock’s, as well as the KapStone board’s belief that
neither Party A nor Party B would be willing or able to improve its proposal to be more
compelling to KapStone stockholders than the merger agreement.

• The KapStone board also considered its belief, taking into account, among other things, its
familiarity with the industry and discussions with KapStone’s senior management and financial
advisors, that other potentially interested parties were unlikely to be willing to acquire KapStone
at a purchase price in excess of the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share
offered by WestRock and that such other potentially interested parties would be able to submit a
competing proposal, if they so desired, following the announcement of the execution of the merger
agreement.

• Course of Negotiations.   The KapStone board considered the course of negotiations with WestRock,
including the $6.00 per KapStone share increase offered by WestRock from its initial offer and
WestRock’s statements that WestRock’s offer would terminate if the parties had not executed a
definitive agreement by the morning of January 29, 2018 and that the KapStone cash consideration of 
$35.00 per KapStone share was the highest price WestRock was willing to pay. In light of the foregoing
and discussions with senior management and KapStone’s financial advisors, the KapStone board
believed that the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share was the highest price that
WestRock was willing to pay for KapStone.

• Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value.   The KapStone board considered the fact that the KapStone
cash consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing KapStone stockholders with certainty of value and
liquidity immediately upon the closing of the mergers, in comparison to the risks and uncertainty that
would be inherent in remaining a stand-alone company or pursuing a transaction in which KapStone
stockholders were required to receive consideration that consisted of stock.

• Stock Election.

• The KapStone board considered the fact that, although the merger agreement permits KapStone
stockholders to elect to receive a portion of the KapStone merger consideration in the form of
Holdco shares, the exchange ratio governing the number of such Holdco shares that will be
received per KapStone share is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the
trading price of either KapStone shares or WestRock shares and such stock elections are subject to
proration procedures that are designed to ensure that the KapStone merger consideration in the
form of Holdco shares is received in respect of no more than 25% of the issued and outstanding
KapStone shares immediately prior to the effective time, and that a U.S. holder of KapStone
shares electing to receive all or a portion of the KapStone merger consideration in the form of
Holdco shares should not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the
exchange of KapStone shares for Holdco shares in the KapStone merger.

• The KapStone board considered that this stock election permits KapStone stockholders the ability
to elect to continue to participate in the potential growth prospects of the combined company and
benefit from any synergies resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement. It was noted that, for illustrative purposes and based on a review of synergy
estimates in precedent transactions and using publicly available information about WestRock, an
estimate of potential synergies of the combined company had been prepared by KapStone
management with respect to overhead, procurement, supply chain and operations and integration,
resulting in a range of synergies of between $145 million and $235 million. The foregoing
illustrative estimate of synergies was

• No Financing Condition; Ability to Finance.   The KapStone board considered that the mergers are
not subject to a financing condition and, in particular, that WestRock represented that, at the closing, it
will have sufficient cash to pay the KapStone cash consideration and the other amounts payable in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the
related fees and expenses of WestRock, Holdco, WestRock merger sub and KapStone merger sub.

• Opinion of Rothschild.   The KapStone board considered the financial analyses presented by
Rothschild and Rothschild’s opinion to the effect that, as of January 28, 2018 and based on and subject
to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in Rothschild’s written
opinion, dated the same date, the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the
mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
KapStone stockholders (see the section entitled “— Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors — 
Rothschild Inc.”, beginning on page 64). In considering such opinion, the KapStone board took into
account responses to inquiries it made to Rothschild regarding past fees received by Rothschild for
services provided to KapStone and that Rothschild had not received any fees for services to KapStone
or WestRock during the prior two years, and fees payable to Rothschild in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

• Opinion of Moelis.   The KapStone board considered the financial analyses presented by Moelis and
Moelis’ opinion to the effect that, as of January 28, 2018 and based on and subject to the assumptions,
procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in Moelis’ written opinion, the KapStone
cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share to be received by KapStone stockholders pursuant to
the merger agreement is fair, from a financial point of view to such KapStone stockholders (see the
section entitled “— Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors — Moelis & Company LLC”,
beginning on page 71). In considering such opinion, the KapStone board took into account responses to
inquiries it made to Moelis regarding past fees received by Moelis for services provided to KapStone
and that Moelis had not received any fees for services to KapStone or WestRock during the prior
two years, and fees payable to Moelis in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

• The Merger Agreement.   The KapStone board considered the general terms and conditions of the
merger agreement and the course of negotiations of the key provisions thereof, including:

• the representations, warranties and covenants made by each party, including KapStone’s ability to
continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement;

• KapStone’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct
negotiations with a third party, if the KapStone board determines in good faith, after consultation
with KapStone’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such third party has made an
acquisition proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal;

circumstances existing after the date that such estimate of synergies was prepared or to reflect the
occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying such
estimate of synergies are shown to be in error.

• the fact that, in certain circumstances, the KapStone board is permitted to change the KapStone
recommendation and to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to
a superior proposal, subject to the payment to WestRock of a termination fee of  $105,600,265, or
approximately 3% of the equity value of the transaction;

• the fact that, in certain other circumstances not related to a superior proposal, the KapStone board
is permitted to change the KapStone recommendation, which would result in WestRock having the
right to terminate the merger agreement at which time KapStone would be required to pay
WestRock a termination fee of  $105,600,265; and

• the KapStone board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement were reasonable and would not
discourage other potential acquirers from making an alternative proposal to acquire KapStone.

• Structure; Company Stockholder Adoption.   The KapStone board considered that the structure of
the transaction as a one-step statutory merger of KapStone will result in detailed public disclosure and a
substantial period of time prior to the meeting of KapStone stockholders to consider adoption of the
merger agreement during which an unsolicited superior proposal could be brought forth, particularly
given the belief of the KapStone board that other potential acquirers of KapStone are familiar with
KapStone and its industry. The KapStone board also considered that completion of the KapStone
merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding KapStone
shares.

• Availability of Appraisal Rights.   The KapStone board considered the availability of appraisal rights
under Delaware law to KapStone stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and who otherwise comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL, which provides such eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have the Court of Chancery
determine the fair value of their KapStone shares, which may be more than, less than or the same as the
amount such stockholders would have received under the merger agreement.

• Consummation of the Merger.   The KapStone board considered the conditions to the consummation
of the mergers and the likelihood of closing and noted the fact that no non-governmental third party
consents are conditions to the consummation of the mergers and the belief that the prospects for
receiving all required regulatory approvals are favorable. The KapStone board considered its belief that
the merger agreement, taken as a whole, provides a high degree of protection against the risk that
consummation of the mergers is delayed or that the mergers cannot be completed in connection with
regulatory approvals, based on, among other things, the following:

• the fact that each party is required to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary to cause as promptly as reasonably practicable the receipt of all antitrust regulatory
approvals;

• the fact that in addition to the above each party is required to take all actions necessary to resolve
objections to the consummation of the mergers under any antitrust laws, provided that WestRock
is not required to undertake any divestiture actions if such divestiture actions, in combination with
all other divestiture actions, would require (i) the divestiture of any mill that had annual
production capacity as of September 30, 2017 of more than 600,000 tons of product or (ii) any
divestiture actions (without giving effect to a divestiture action contemplated by clause (i)) that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on KapStone, WestRock and their
respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measuring such companies as a whole as though they
were the size of KapStone and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole); and

• the merger agreement may be terminated by KapStone or WestRock if the mergers have not been
consummated by October 29, 2018, subject to extension under certain circumstances to April 29,
2019 if necessary to obtain the required antitrust approvals.

• Specific Performance Right.   The KapStone board considered the fact that, if any of the other parties
to the merger agreement breaches its obligations under the merger agreement, KapStone is entitled to
specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement, in addition to any other remedies to
which KapStone may be entitled.

• the fact that, while KapStone received proposals from two other potentially interested parties (including
the proposal solicited by KapStone from Party A) KapStone did not engage in a broader competitive
bid process or other broad solicitation of interest; the KapStone board noted that its decision not to
engage in a broader competitive bid process was informed by (a) the strength of WestRock’s offer of
KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share, (b) its belief, based on its familiarity with
the industry and consultation with KapStone’s management and KapStone’s financial advisors, that
other potentially interested parties (including financial buyers) would not likely be prepared to pay
more than the KapStone cash consideration, (c) concerns regarding confidentiality breaches that could
result from engaging in a broader competitive bid process and potential for negative implications to
KapStone’s business operations, (d) the fact that any potentially interested parties would be able to
submit a competing proposal, if they so desired, following the announcement of the execution of the
merger agreement and (e) its belief that the terms of the merger agreement were reasonable and would
not discourage other potential acquirers from making an alternative proposal to acquire KapStone;

• the fact that the merger agreement precludes KapStone from actively soliciting alternative proposals;

• the fact that, following the mergers, KapStone will no longer exist as an independent public company
and existing KapStone stockholders who do not receive KapStone stock consideration will not
participate in the future earnings or growth of KapStone or WestRock or benefit from any synergies
that may result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• the fact that the mergers might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of
certain conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extensions
thereof) under the HSR Act and the receipt of antitrust approval from certain jurisdictions other than
the U.S.;

• the restrictions in the merger agreement on the conduct of KapStone’s business prior to the
consummation of the mergers, which may delay or prevent KapStone from undertaking certain
business opportunities that may arise;

• the fact that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the KapStone cash consideration will be taxable to
KapStone stockholders who are entitled to receive such consideration (including KapStone
stockholders who may have elected to receive the KapStone stock consideration but, due to proration,
may receive KapStone cash consideration in respect of a portion of their KapStone shares);

• the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the mergers and the
substantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, which may disrupt KapStone’s business operations;

• the risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, including the impact on KapStone’s employees (and the impairment of
KapStone’s ability to attract, retain and motivate its employees, including key personnel) and its
relationships with existing and prospective customers, distributors, suppliers and other third parties;
and

• the fact that KapStone’s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different
from, and in addition to, those of KapStone stockholders (such as change in control or termination
payments).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the course of its deliberations, the KapStone board also considered certain risks and other potentially
negative factors concerning the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including:

• WestRock expects to generate cost synergies and performance improvements through the integration of
KapStone’s operations into WestRock’s corrugated packaging system;

• the mergers will enable WestRock to strengthen its presence on the West Coast of the United States
through KapStone’s West Coast facilities and reduce costs across its supply chain;

• the mergers will enable WestRock to broaden its differentiated paper and packaging solutions portfolio
to existing customers through KapStone’s specialty kraft paper offerings;

• the mergers will increase WestRock’s overall mix of virgin fiber;

• WestRock expects that the mergers will be accretive to WestRock’s adjusted earnings and cash flow;
and

• the mergers are consistent with WestRock’s strategic goals.

• the challenges inherent in completing the mergers, integrating the businesses, operations and
workforces of KapStone with those of WestRock, and developing and executing a successful strategy
and business plan for the combined company;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the KapStone board is not intended to
be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the KapStone board. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the complexity of these matters, the
KapStone board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination and the KapStone recommendation. In addition,
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The KapStone board did not undertake
to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any
factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The KapStone board based the KapStone
recommendation on its consideration of the totality of the information presented to it, including the factors
described above.

In considering the KapStone recommendation, KapStone stockholders should be aware that the executive
officers and directors of KapStone have certain interests, including financial interests, in the mergers that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of KapStone stockholders generally. The KapStone board was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in making the KapStone recommendation. For additional information, see
the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors
and Officers in the Mergers”, beginning on page 77.

WestRock’s Reasons for the Mergers

At its meeting on January 28, 2018, the WestRock board unanimously approved and declared advisable the
form, terms and provisions of the merger agreement and the WestRock merger and the KapStone merger.

In evaluating the merger agreement, the WestRock board consulted with and received the advice of
WestRock’s management and its legal and financial advisors. In reaching its decision, the WestRock board
considered a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following factors which the WestRock board
viewed as generally supporting its decision to approve and enter into the merger agreement.

Strategic Considerations.   The WestRock board considered that the mergers will likely provide a number of
significant strategic opportunities, including the following:

Other Factors Considered by the WestRock Board.   In addition to considering the strategic factors described
above, the WestRock board considered its knowledge of WestRock’s business, operations, financial condition,
earnings and prospects and of KapStone’s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects,
taking into account the results of WestRock’s due diligence review of KapStone, and the current and prospective
business climate in the industry in which WestRock and KapStone operate.

The WestRock board weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of other factors
identified in its deliberations weighing negatively against the mergers, including:

• the risk that regulatory agencies may object to and challenge the mergers or may impose terms and
conditions in order to resolve those objections that adversely affect the financial results of the
combined company; see the section entitled “— Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers”,
beginning on page 87;

• the risk that KapStone stockholders may object to and challenge the mergers and take actions that may
prevent or delay the consummation of the mergers, including voting against the KapStone merger
proposal;

• the risk that, despite the efforts of WestRock and KapStone prior to the consummation of the mergers,
the combined company may lose key personnel;

• the risk of not capturing the anticipated cost synergies and performance improvements, and the risk that
other anticipated benefits might not be realized;

• the possibility that the combined company might not achieve its projected financial results;

• the potential that the fixed exchange ratio under the merger agreement could result in Holdco delivering
greater value to the KapStone stockholders than had been anticipated by WestRock should the value of
the WestRock shares increase from the date of the execution of the merger agreement; and

• the risks of the type and nature described under “Risk Factors”, beginning on page 33, and the matters
described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, beginning on page
41.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the WestRock board is not intended to be exhaustive,
but rather includes the principal factors considered by the WestRock board. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the complexity of these matters, the WestRock
board did not find it useful and did not attempt to quantify or assign any relative or specific weights to the various
factors that it considered in reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement. In addition, individual
members of the WestRock board may have given differing weights to different factors. The WestRock board
conducted an overall review of the factors described above, including thorough discussions with WestRock’s
management and outside legal and financial advisors.

The explanation of the reasoning of the WestRock board and certain information presented in this section are
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the
section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, beginning on page 41 of this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Opinions of KapStone’s Financial Advisors

Rothschild Inc.

KapStone retained Rothschild to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. In connection
with Rothschild’s engagement, the KapStone board requested that Rothschild evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone
stockholders in the mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. On January 28, 2018, at a meeting of
the KapStone board held to evaluate the mergers, Rothschild rendered to the KapStone board an oral opinion,
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, to the effect that, as of that date and based on
and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in Rothschild’s written
opinion, the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the mergers pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such KapStone stockholders.

The full text of Rothschild’s written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, to the KapStone board, which sets
forth, among other things, the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Rothschild in connection with such opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/ prospectus as
Annex B. The description of Rothschild’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of Rothschild’s opinion. Rothschild’s opinion was

• reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, dated January 27, 2018;

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information that Rothschild deemed to be
generally relevant concerning KapStone and the industry in which it operates, including certain
publicly available research analyst reports and the reported price and historical trading activity for
KapStone shares;

• compared the proposed financial terms of the mergers with the publicly available financial terms of
certain transactions involving companies Rothschild deemed generally relevant and the consideration
received in such transactions;

• compared the financial and operating performance of KapStone with publicly available information
concerning certain other public companies Rothschild deemed generally relevant, including implied
trading multiples;

• reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of KapStone, including the KapStone forecasts;

• reviewed the historical trading prices and trading activity for KapStone shares;

• reviewed the premia paid in certain publicly available transactions, which Rothschild believed to be
generally relevant; and

• performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as
Rothschild deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.

provided for the benefit of the KapStone board (solely in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purpose of its evaluation of the mergers and was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the mergers
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. Rothschild’s opinion did not address the underlying decision that
KapStone made to engage in the mergers or any alternative transaction, including the relative merits of the
mergers as compared to any alternative transaction, including any alternative transaction that the KapStone board
has considered and elected not to pursue. Rothschild’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the
KapStone board as to whether to approve the mergers or a recommendation as to whether or not any KapStone
stockholder should vote, make any election or otherwise act with respect to the mergers or any other matter.

In arriving at its opinion, Rothschild, among other things:

In addition, Rothschild held discussions with certain members of management of KapStone regarding the
mergers, the past and current business operations and financial condition and prospects of KapStone, the
KapStone forecasts and certain other matters Rothschild believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

In arriving at Rothschild’s opinion, Rothschild, with the KapStone board’s consent, relied upon and
assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly
available or was furnished or made available to Rothschild by KapStone and its associates, affiliates and advisors,
or otherwise reviewed by or for Rothschild, and Rothschild did not assume any responsibility or liability therefor.
Rothschild did not conduct any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities of KapStone (including, without
limitation, real property owned by KapStone or to which KapStone holds a leasehold interest), nor were any such
valuations or appraisals provided to Rothschild, and Rothschild did not express any opinion as to the value of
such assets or liabilities. Rothschild did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of KapStone, WestRock or Holdco
under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In addition,
Rothschild did not assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or the facilities of
KapStone. At the direction of management of KapStone, Rothschild used and relied upon the KapStone forecasts
for purposes of its opinion. In relying on the KapStone forecasts, Rothschild assumed, at the direction of
KapStone, that the KapStone forecasts were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by KapStone’s management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of KapStone and that the financial results reflected in such KapStone forecasts
would

be achieved at the times and in the amounts projected. Rothschild did not express a view as to the reasonableness
of the KapStone forecasts and the assumptions on which they are based. Certain data underlying Rothschild’s
analysis and opinion pre-dated (and/or did not reflect the impact of) the then-recently enacted federal tax
legislation (referred to as the tax changes) and the then-recently announced price increases for certain of
KapStone’s products (referred to as the price increases).

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Rothschild assumed that the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement would be consummated as contemplated in the merger agreement without any waiver or amendment
of any material terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the parties would comply with all
material terms of the merger agreement and that in connection with the receipt of all necessary governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the mergers, no material delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions would be imposed. Rothschild also assumed that no material change in the assets, financial condition,
results of operations, business or prospects of KapStone had occurred since the date of the most recent financial
statements and other information, financial or otherwise, relating to KapStone made available to Rothschild, and
that there was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Rothschild
incomplete or misleading. Rothschild did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that may
result from the mergers, nor does Rothschild’s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters.
Rothschild relied as to all legal, tax and regulatory matters relevant to rendering Rothschild’s opinion upon the
assessments made by KapStone and its other advisors with respect to such issues. In arriving at Rothschild’s
opinion, Rothschild did not take into account any litigation, regulatory or other proceeding that is pending or may
be brought against KapStone or any of its affiliates. In addition, Rothschild relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, that the final form of the merger agreement would not differ in any material respect
from the draft of the merger agreement reviewed by Rothschild.

Rothschild’s opinion was necessarily based on securities markets, economic, monetary, financial and other
general business and financial conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and the information made
available to Rothschild as of, the date of its opinion and the conditions and prospects, financial and otherwise, of
KapStone as they were reflected in the information provided to Rothschild and as they were represented to
Rothschild in discussions with management of KapStone. Rothschild did not express any opinion as to the price
at which KapStone shares or Holdco shares will trade at any future time, the value of Holdco shares (including
the value of Holdco shares issued as KapStone stock consideration pursuant to the merger agreement), or whether
any market would develop for Holdco shares. Rothschild’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash consideration payable to such stockholders in the
mergers pursuant to the merger agreement and Rothschild did not express any opinion as to any underlying
decisions which KapStone made or may have made to engage in the mergers and not in any alternative
transaction. Rothschild was not asked to, nor did Rothschild, offer any opinion as to the terms, other than the
KapStone cash consideration to the extent expressly set forth in the opinion, of the mergers, the merger
agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the mergers (including, without limitation, the
fairness or value of the KapStone stock consideration or the relative fairness of the KapStone cash consideration
and the KapStone stock consideration).

Rothschild’s opinion was given and speaks only as of its date. Subsequent developments may affect
Rothschild’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Rothschild does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. Rothschild’s opinion was approved by the Global Financial Advisory
Commitment Committee of Rothschild.

Rothschild’s opinion was provided for the benefit of the KapStone board (solely in its capacity as such) in
connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the mergers. Rothschild’s opinion should not be
construed as creating any fiduciary duty on Rothschild’s part to any party. In addition, the KapStone board did
not ask Rothschild to address, and its opinion does not address, (i) the fairness to, or any other consideration of,
the holders of any class of securities (other than KapStone stockholders and then only to the extent expressly set
forth in the opinion) or creditors or other constituencies of KapStone or (ii) the fairness of the amount or nature of
any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of WestRock, KapStone, or
any class of such persons, whether relative to the KapStone cash consideration pursuant to the merger agreement
or otherwise.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The following represents a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Rothschild in
connection with its opinion, dated January 28, 2018, provided to the KapStone board. The summary of these
analyses is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by Rothschild. The preparation
of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process that involves various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Some of the
summaries of financial analyses performed by Rothschild include information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Rothschild, the tables must be read together with
the full text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.
Considering the data set forth in the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Rothschild.

Selected Public Companies Analysis

Rothschild reviewed financial and stock market information of KapStone and the following eight selected
publicly traded companies (referred to as the selected companies), which Rothschild in its professional judgment
considered generally relevant for comparative purposes as publicly traded companies in the containerboard and
paper packaging industry, with revenues and enterprise values greater than $1 billion and significant geographic
reach in North America and/or a global footprint, excluding certain publicly traded North American companies
for which containerboard production is a less material part of such companies’ overall business mix as compared
with KapStone and the other selected public companies:

Rothschild reviewed, among other things:

The overall low to high EV/18E EBITDA observed for the selected companies were 5.7x to 10.0x, with a
median of 8.6x. Rothschild noted that EV/18E EBITDA observed for KapStone was 8.5x based on publicly
available research analysts’ consensus estimates per FactSet. Based on its professional judgment, Rothschild
applied a selected range of EV/18E EBITDA of 8.0x to 9.0x to the projected EV/18E EBITDA of KapStone,
based on the KapStone forecasts, which indicated an approximate implied value per KapStone share reference
range of  $31.00 to $37.00, as compared to the KapStone cash consideration of $35.00 per KapStone share.

The overall low to high EV/18E EBITDA — CAPEX observed for the selected companies were 9.4x to
15.9x, with a median of 13.0x. Rothschild noted that EV/18E EBITDA — CAPEX observed for KapStone was
12.0x based on publicly available research analysts’ consensus estimates per FactSet. Based on its professional
judgment, Rothschild applied a selected range of EV/18E EBITDA — CAPEX of 12.0x to

13.0x to the projected EV/18E EBITDA — CAPEX of KapStone, based on the KapStone forecasts, which
indicated an approximate implied value per KapStone share reference range of  $33.00 to $37.00, as compared to
the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share.

As part of its selected public companies analysis, Rothschild also created an alternative range of multiples
intended to address consensus estimates not yet updated for the price increases, which were announced on the
afternoon of January 26, 2018, the last trading day prior to the delivery of Rothschild’s opinion. Rothschild
calculated the percentage variation between the then-current publicly available research analysts’ consensus
estimates for KapStone’s 2018 EBITDA and KapStone’s 2018 projected EBITDA without giving effect to the
price increases. Rothschild used this percentage variation (which was 4.8% for EV/18E EBITDA and 2.2% for
EV/18E EBITDA — CAPEX) to correspondingly adjust the multiple range for EV/18E EBITDA and EV/18E
EBITDA — CAPEX (which were based on KapStone’s 2018 projected EBITDA after giving effect to the price
increases). This methodology resulted in an adjusted EV/18E EBITDA range of 7.0x to 8.0x, which indicated an
approximate implied per KapStone share reference range of  $25.00 to $31.00, and an adjusted EV/18E EBITDA 
— CAPEX range of 10.0x to 11.0x, which indicated an approximate implied per KapStone share reference range
of  $25.00 to $29.00, in each case, as compared to the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone
share.

No company utilized in the selected public companies analysis is identical to KapStone. In evaluating the
selected companies, Rothschild made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
KapStone, such as the impact of competition on the businesses of KapStone and the industry generally, industry
growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KapStone or
the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the median) is not
in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.

Financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ consensus
estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of KapStone was based on
publicly available research analysts’ estimates, public filings and the KapStone forecasts.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis

Rothschild reviewed and considered publicly available financial information of the following 17 selected
transactions (referred to as the selected transactions), which Rothschild in its professional judgment considered
generally relevant for comparative purposes and which involved containerboard and paper packaging companies
since 2008, focusing primarily on recent transactions involving pure-play containerboard and paper packaging
companies, each with enterprise values greater than $200 million, and including any transactions involving
KapStone or WestRock, for which information was publicly available:

Rothschild reviewed, among other things, the ratio of EV to EBITDA for the last twelve-month period
available prior to the announcement of each selected transaction (referred to as EV/EBITDA).

The overall low to high EV/EBITDA observed for the selected transactions were 5.7x to 13.1x, with a
median of 8.6x. Rothschild applied a selected range of EV/EBITDA of 8.5x to 10.0x to the historical EBITDA of
KapStone for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which historical EBITDA was based on preliminary
financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, provided by KapStone’s management as of
January 18, 2018, that had then not yet been publicly disclosed, which indicated an approximate implied value
per KapStone share reference range of  $23.00 to $30.00, as compared to the KapStone cash consideration of 
$35.00 per KapStone share.

No target company utilized in the selected precedent transactions analysis is identical to KapStone. In
evaluating the selected transactions, Rothschild made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of KapStone, such as the impact of competition on the businesses of KapStone and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of KapStone or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as
determining the median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transactions data.

Financial data of the selected transactions, and the target companies therein, were based on public filings
and other publicly available information. Financial data of KapStone was based on the KapStone forecasts.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Rothschild performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which calculates an implied value per share by
discounting to the present the value of unlevered free cash flow for 2018 to 2024, based on the KapStone
forecasts, assuming the tax changes and the price increases, and adding thereto a terminal value for KapStone
calculated using a range of terminal growth rates from 2.0% to 3.0%. In its analysis, Rothschild utilized a range
of discount rates from 8.5% to 9.5%, which was selected based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital
of KapStone. The foregoing analysis indicated an approximate implied value per KapStone share reference range
of  $22.00 to $32.00, as compared to the KapStone cash consideration of $35.00 per KapStone share.

Other Factors

Rothschild also noted for the KapStone board certain additional factors that were not considered in its
financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but that were referred to for informational purposes.

Specifically, Rothschild reviewed with the KapStone board the following, in each case, as compared to the
KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share:

• the generally available public market trading price targets for KapStone shares prepared and published
by research analysts, which ranged from approximately $21.00 to $30.00;

• the present value of the future price of KapStone shares (referred to as the PV of future KapStone share
price) implied by KapStone’s projected EBITDA and net debt for 2019 and 2020, based on the
KapStone forecasts, discounted at a rate of 12.2%, which was selected based on the estimated cost of
equity of KapStone; this methodology implied an approximate implied value per KapStone share
reference range of  $30.00 to $36.00; and

• the PV of future KapStone share price implied by KapStone’s projected EBITDA for 2019 and 2020, as
adjusted for the price increases using the methodology described above in “Selected Public Companies
Analysis”, which implied an approximate implied value per KapStone share reference range of  $25.00
to $31.00.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Miscellaneous

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth herein, without
considering the analyses or the summary as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Rothschild’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Rothschild considered the results of all of its
analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered. Rather, Rothschild made
its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the analyses described herein as a comparison is
directly comparable to KapStone or the mergers.

Rothschild prepared the analyses described herein for purposes of providing its opinion to the KapStone
board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash
consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Rothschild’s analyses were based in part upon
the KapStone forecasts and other third party research analyst estimates, which are not necessarily indicative of
actual future results and which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by Rothschild’s
analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties to the merger agreement or their respective advisors, none of KapStone,
WestRock, Holdco, Rothschild or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those forecasted by KapStone’s management or third parties.

As described above, the opinion of Rothschild to the KapStone board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the KapStone board in making its determination to approve the mergers. Rothschild was not
asked to, and did not, recommend the specific consideration to KapStone stockholders provided for in the merger
agreement, which consideration was determined through arms-length negotiations between KapStone and
WestRock. Rothschild did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to KapStone stockholders or the
KapStone board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for
the mergers.

Rothschild is acting as financial advisor to KapStone in connection with the mergers and will be entitled to
receive a fee of approximately $22 million, $5 million of which became payable upon delivery of its opinion and
the balance of which is contingent upon the consummation of the mergers. In addition, KapStone agreed to
reimburse certain of Rothschild’s expenses and indemnify Rothschild against certain liabilities that may arise out
of its engagement. Rothschild or its affiliates may, in the ordinary course of their business from time to time, in
the future provide financial services to KapStone, WestRock, Holdco and/or their respective affiliates and may
receive fees for the rendering of such services. Rothschild and its affiliates are engaged in a wide range of
financial advisory and investment banking activities.

In the ordinary course of their asset management, merchant banking and other business activities,
Rothschild’s affiliates may trade in the securities of KapStone, WestRock, Holdco and any of their respective
affiliates, for their own accounts or for the accounts of their affiliates and customers, and may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities.

Moelis & Company LLC

KapStone retained Moelis to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers. In connection with
Moelis’ engagement, the KapStone board requested that Moelis evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to KapStone stockholders of the KapStone cash consideration payable to KapStone stockholders in the
mergers pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. On January 25, 2018, Moelis presented its preliminary
financial analysis of KapStone to the KapStone board. On January 28, 2018, at a meeting of the KapStone board
held to evaluate the mergers, Moelis rendered to the KapStone board an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, based on and subject to
the qualifications, conditions, limitations and assumptions set forth in Moelis’ written opinion, the KapStone cash
consideration to be received by KapStone stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial
point of view, to KapStone stockholders.

The full text of Moelis’ written opinion, dated January 28, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Moelis in connection with
such opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C. The description of Moelis’ opinion set
forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Moelis’ opinion.
Moelis’ opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the KapStone board (solely in its capacity as such) in its
evaluation of the mergers. Moelis’ opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
KapStone cash consideration and does not address KapStone’s underlying business decision to effect the mergers
or the relative merits of the mergers as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might
be available with respect to KapStone. Moelis’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
KapStone stockholder should vote, make any election (including without limitation, a stock election), or act with
respect to the mergers or any other matter.

In arriving at its opinion, Moelis, among other things:

In connection with its review, with the consent of the KapStone board, Moelis relied on the information
supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by Moelis for purposes of its opinion being complete and accurate in all
material respects. Moelis did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of such
information. With the consent of the KapStone board, Moelis relied upon, without

TABLE OF CONTENTS

independent verification, the assessment of KapStone and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with
respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. With respect to the KapStone forecasts, Moelis assumed,
at the direction of the KapStone board, that such forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of KapStone as to the future performance of
KapStone, including with respect to the effects of the recently enacted federal tax legislation, and the recently
announced price increases for certain of KapStone’s products. Moelis expressed no views as to the
reasonableness of the KapStone forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, with the
consent of the KapStone board, Moelis did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets
or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of KapStone, nor was Moelis furnished with
any such evaluation or appraisal.

Moelis’ opinion did not address KapStone’s underlying business decision to effect the mergers or the
relative merits of the mergers as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be
available to KapStone. Moelis’ opinion did not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. At the
direction of the KapStone board, Moelis was not asked to, and did not, offer any opinion as to any terms of the
merger agreement or any aspect or implication of the mergers (including, without limitation, the fairness or value
of the KapStone stock consideration or the relative fairness of the KapStone cash consideration and the KapStone
stock consideration), except for the fairness of the KapStone cash consideration from a financial point of view to
KapStone stockholders. With the consent of the KapStone board, Moelis expressed no opinion as to what the
value of Holdco shares, including any Holdco shares received in connection with any stock election, actually will
be when issued pursuant to the mergers or the prices at which Holdco shares may trade at any time. In rendering
its opinion, Moelis assumed, with the consent of the KapStone board, that the final executed form of the merger
agreement and the voting agreements would not differ in any material respect from the drafts that Moelis
reviewed, that the mergers would be consummated in accordance with its terms without any waiver or
modification that could be material to Moelis’ analysis, and that the parties to the merger agreement and voting
agreements would comply with all the material terms of the merger agreement and voting agreements, as
applicable. Moelis also assumed, with the consent of the KapStone board, that all governmental, regulatory or
other consents or approvals necessary for the completion of the mergers will be obtained, except to the extent that
could not be material to Moelis’ analysis.

Moelis’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to Moelis as of, the date of the opinion, and Moelis assumed no responsibility
to update its opinion for developments after the date of the opinion. Certain data underlying Moelis’ analysis and
opinion pre-dates (and/or does not reflect the impact of) recently enacted federal tax legislation. The financial and
stock markets have been adjusting to the impacts of such legislation, and Moelis expressed no opinion or view as
to any potential effects of such impacts on KapStone, WestRock or the mergers.

Summary of Financial Analyses of KapStone

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Moelis to the KapStone board at
its meeting held on January 28, 2018, in connection with its opinion. The following summary describes the
material analysis underlying Moelis’ opinion but does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Moelis in connection with its opinion.

Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order
to fully understand Moelis’ analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data described below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Moelis’ analyses.

Selected Public Companies Analysis.   Moelis performed a selected public companies analysis, which was
intended to provide a range of implied values of KapStone by comparing certain of its financial information with
corresponding financial information of similar public companies. In performing this analysis, Moelis reviewed
certain financial and stock market information relating to selected publicly traded companies in the integrated
containerboard and corrugated packaging industry, with revenues and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

enterprise values greater than $1 billion and significant geographic reach in North America and/or a global
footprint, excluding certain publicly traded North American companies for which containerboard production is a
less material part of such companies’ overall business mix as compared with KapStone and the other selected
public companies. The following table indicates the companies reviewed by Moelis:

North America Paperboard Europe Paperboard

International Paper Company Mondi plc
WestRock Smurfit Kappa Group plc

Packaging Corporation of America DS Smith plc
Graphic Packaging Holding Company

Cascades Inc.

Financial data for the selected public companies was based on Wall Street research analyst consensus
forecasts, public filings and other publicly available information and included, as appropriate, adjustments for
one-time items, stock-based compensation and material acquisitions. Although none of the selected companies is
directly comparable to KapStone, the companies included were selected because they are companies that, for
purposes of this analysis, had certain characteristics that may be considered reasonably comparable to KapStone.

As part of its selected public companies analysis, Moelis calculated and analyzed each selected company’s
implied enterprise value (calculated as equity value, plus total debt and minority interest, less cash) and multiples
of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash and non-recurring expenses
or gains (referred to as EBITDA) based on publicly available consensus research analysts’ EBITDA estimates for
the estimated calendar year 2018 (referred to as CY 2018P) (all of which estimates were issued prior to price
increases on containerboard products announced on January 26, 2018 by KapStone and International Paper
Company). The implied enterprise value to CY 2018P EBITDA multiples of the selected public companies as of
January 26, 2018 are summarized below:

In reviewing the characteristics of the selected public companies for purposes of determining a reference
range, Moelis noted that (i) it viewed International Paper Company and WestRock as more similar to KapStone
than the other selected public companies based on certain business and financial

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

characteristics, (ii) a discount to Packaging Corporation of America (referred to as PCA) was appropriate at the
high end of the reference range given PCA’s leading operational and financial metrics and asset quality, (iii) it
deemed Cascades Inc. as less relevant to KapStone due to material differences in margin profile, geography and
product mix and (iv) it also considered the trading multiples of the selected European paperboard companies.

Moelis further noted that each of the selected companies has certain attributes which limit their
comparability to KapStone, such as: (i) Graphic Packaging Holding Company primarily produces boxboard, sells
to consumer-facing end users and manufactures only a small amount of containerboard at one of its mills;
(ii) approximately 20% and 24% of Mondi plc’s business consists of consumer-facing plastic packaging products
and uncoated fine paper, respectively; (iii) both International Paper Company and PCA have white paper mills
that produce sizeable amounts of uncoated free sheet; (iv) Cascades Inc. is levered to the Canadian geography,
competes heavily in the tissue segment and has a less competitive cost structure that has resulted in EBITDA
margins far below the rest of the selected companies; (v) WestRock has an established containerboard presence in
Brazil and a consumer packaging footprint across North America, Europe and Asia; (vi) International Paper
Company has operations in Brazil, Europe and India; (vii) approximately 73% of Smurfit Kappa Group plc’s
EBITDA is generated in Europe; and (viii) DS Smith plc’s operations were primarily confined to Europe up until
its recent acquisition of Interstate Resources.

Based on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis selected a multiple
range of 8.0x to 9.25x CY 2018P EBITDA and applied the selected range to KapStone’s CY 2018P EBITDA
based on the 2018 – 2024 forecasts provided by KapStone’s management to calculate an implied range of values
per KapStone share. This resulted in a reference range of  $30.58 to $37.42 per KapStone share, which compares
to the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share. Moelis noted that the reference range was
derived using multiples of selected public companies based on consensus estimates issued prior to the price
increases announced on containerboard products on January 26, 2018 by KapStone and International Paper
Company, applied to KapStone’s CY 2018P EBITDA included in the 2018 – 2024 forecasts provided by
KapStone’s management, which included the impact of the price increase (such 2018 – 2024 forecasts are more
fully described in the section entitled “— Certain KapStone Forecasts”, beginning on page 96).

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.   Moelis compared selected financial and transaction metrics of
the KapStone merger with similar data (where available) of selected transactions involving integrated
containerboard and paper-based packaging production and converting companies since 2008, focusing primarily
on the transactions that occurred after 2011 and recent transactions involving pure-play corrugated packaging
converting businesses, each with enterprise values greater than $200 million, and including any transactions
involving KapStone or WestRock, for which information was publicly available.

The selected precedent transactions were selected with respect to KapStone because they represented in
Moelis’ view the transactions most relevant to the mergers. Moelis noted that the data underlying the selected
precedent transactions analysis pre-dates (and/or does not reflect the impact of) recently enacted federal tax
legislation. Moelis also noted that all of the selected precedent transactions were completed prior to the price
increases for containerboard products announced on January 26, 2018.

For each of the selected precedent transactions, Moelis calculated valuation multiples based on information
that was publicly available, focusing on the ratio of transaction value (enterprise value) to EBITDA for the
identified target company for the most recent reported twelve month period (referred to as LTM) as of the
announcement date of the transaction, adjusted to exclude one-time charges and benefits.

In reviewing the characteristics of the selected precedent transactions for purposes of determining a
reference range, Moelis noted that it (i) viewed (a) the International Paper Company/Weyerhaueser Company’s
CP&R Business, (b) RockTenn/Smurfit Stone Container Corporation, (c) International Paper Company/Temple-
Inland Inc. and (d) KapStone/Longview Fibre Paper and Packaging, Inc. transactions as most relevant, as each
reflected either a similar mill or integrated corrugated packaging transaction, (ii) considered DS Smith
plc/Interstate Resources Inc. to be a relevant transaction but noted that the transaction was announced on June 29,
2017, with the transaction value (referred to as TV) multiple based on calendar year 2016 EBITDA, which did
not fully capture product price increases that were announced in

Based on the foregoing analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Moelis applied a selected
multiple range of 8.0x to 10.5x KapStone’s 2017 actual EBITDA using financial information and data provided
by KapStone’s management. This resulted in a reference range of  $20.55 to $31.22 per KapStone share, as
compared to the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.   Moelis performed a discounted cash flow (referred to as DCF) analysis
using the 2018 – 2024 forecasts provided by KapStone’s management to calculate the estimated present value of
the future unlevered after-tax free cash flows projected to be generated by KapStone, including terminal free cash
flows. Moelis (i) treated KapStone management’s estimates for stock-based compensation as a cash expense for
purposes of the DCF analysis and (ii) reflected KapStone management’s estimated tax rate of 24% in all periods,
taking into account KapStone management’s estimate of the impact of recently enacted tax legislation. In
performing the DCF analysis, Moelis utilized a range of discount rates of 8.75% to 10.75% based on an estimated
range of KapStone’s weighted average cost of capital (referred to as WACC). The WACC range reflected a
derived cost of equity using (i) a selected range of betas and debt to total capitalization ratios informed by the
selected public companies and KapStone’s own statistics as of January 26, 2018 and (ii) a size premium based on
companies with equity values similar to KapStone. Moelis noted that the data underlying the WACC calculations
pre-dates (and/or does not reflect the impact of) recently enacted federal tax legislation. The foregoing range of
discount rates was used to calculate estimated present values as of December 31, 2017 of  (i) KapStone’s
estimated after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years ending December 2018 to 2024 and (ii) a range of

• the range of historical closing stock prices for KapStone shares during the preceding 52 weeks of
$19.59 per KapStone share to $26.54 per KapStone share; and

• the share price targets for KapStone shares in publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ reports
published between January 3, 2018 and January 11, 2018, which indicated low and high stock price
targets ranging from $26.00 per KapStone share to $30.00 per KapStone share. Moelis noted that these
reports were all issued prior to recently announced price increases for certain of KapStone’s products.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

estimated terminal values derived by applying a range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% to KapStone’s
terminal unlevered free cash flow projection. The perpetuity growth rate range was informed by (i) KapStone
management’s assumptions for industry price and volume growth, (ii) implied terminal EBITDA multiples of
6.4x to 9.6x reflecting recent and historical trading multiples of the selected public companies and (iii) long-term
GDP growth. Terminal free cash flow was calculated by KapStone’s management as fiscal year 2024 unlevered
free cash flow adjusted to reflect normalized levels for changes in working capital and depreciation, and to
eliminate tax deductible amortization which ceases in fiscal year 2029 (with the tax benefit of deductible
amortization in fiscal year 2025 – 2029 separately calculated and included in the derived DCF per share values).

Based on the foregoing, Moelis derived a reference range of  $18.50 to $31.93 per KapStone share, which
compares to the KapStone cash consideration of  $35.00 per KapStone share.

Additional Information

Moelis also provided certain other additional information for the KapStone board for information purposes,
including, among other things:

Miscellaneous

This summary of the analyses is not a complete description of Moelis’ opinion or the analyses underlying,
and factors considered in connection with, Moelis’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions
of the analyses or summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying Moelis’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Moelis
considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis.
Rather, Moelis made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of its analyses.

No company or transaction used in the analyses described above is identical to KapStone, WestRock or the
mergers. In addition, such analyses do not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by such analyses. Because the analyses described above are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of KapStone,
WestRock, Holdco, Moelis or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those forecasts.

The KapStone merger consideration was determined through arms-length negotiations between KapStone
and WestRock and was approved by the KapStone board. Moelis did not recommend any specific consideration
to KapStone or the KapStone board, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the mergers.

In selecting Moelis as its financial advisor, KapStone considered that, among other things, Moelis is an
internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm whose senior professionals
have substantial experience advising companies in, among other industries, the overall integrated containerboard
and corrugated packaging production sector. Moelis, as part of its investment banking, financial advisory and
capital markets businesses, is regularly engaged in the valuation and

• The effective time occurs on August 1, 2018, which is the assumed date of the closing of the mergers
solely for purposes of this merger-related compensation disclosure;

• The relevant price per KapStone share is $35.00, the KapStone cash consideration under the merger
agreement (if the five-day average closing price of a KapStone share following the announcement of
the mergers had been used, the relevant price would have been $34.59);

• Each executive officer was terminated by Holdco without “cause” or resigned for “good reason” (as
applicable, and as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in each case
immediately following the effective time;

• Quantification of outstanding equity-based awards is calculated based on the outstanding equity-based
awards expected to be held by each director or executive officer as of August 1, 2018;

• All unvested KapStone options and KapStone RSU awards that are expected to be held by each
executive officer as of August 1, 2018 remain unvested and unexercised as of the effective time; and

• The amounts set forth below that are based on an executive officer’s base salary or target annual bonus
are based on expected compensation levels as of August 1, 2018.

financial assessment of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations,
spin offs/split-offs, restructurings and securities offerings in both the private and public capital markets and
valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Moelis acted as financial advisor to the KapStone board in connection with the mergers and will receive a
fee for its services, currently estimated to be approximately $22 million in the aggregate, $5 million of which was
paid in connection with the delivery of its opinion, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, and the
remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the mergers. In addition, KapStone has agreed to
indemnify Moelis for certain liabilities arising out of its engagement and reimburse certain fees and expenses.

Moelis’ affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of
KapStone and WestRock. Moelis may in the future provide investment banking and other services to WestRock
and/or KapStone and may receive compensation for such services.

Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers in the Mergers

In considering the KapStone recommendation, KapStone stockholders should be aware that the executive
officers and directors of KapStone have certain interests, including financial interests, in the mergers that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of KapStone stockholders generally. The KapStone board was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in making the KapStone recommendation.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions were used:

Treatment of Outstanding KapStone Equity-Based Awards

At the effective time, each outstanding KapStone equity-based award that is held by an executive officer of
KapStone or a non-employee director of KapStone will be treated in connection with the mergers as described in
“— The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and Employee Stock Purchase Plans”. In lieu
of 2018 grants of equity-based awards, the non-employee directors of KapStone will receive the cash
compensation described in the following section.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Value of Payments.   For an estimate of the value that could become payable to each of the named executive
officers of KapStone in respect of his or her unvested equity-based awards (which, in the case of KapStone
options, takes into account the difference between the applicable exercise price and the value of the KapStone
cash consideration), see “— Quantification of Potential Payments to KapStone’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Mergers” below.

Based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate value
of the amounts that would become payable to (1) the executive officers of KapStone who are not named
executive officers and (2) the non-employee directors of KapStone, in each case, in respect of the vesting of their
unvested KapStone equity-based awards (which, in the case of KapStone options, takes into account the
difference between the applicable exercise price and the value of the KapStone cash consideration) is as follows:
(1) for executive officers of KapStone who are not named executive officers, unvested KapStone options — 
$1,500,285 and unvested KapStone RSU awards  —  $2,100,385; and (2) for the non-employee directors of
KapStone, unvested KapStone options — $875,123 and unvested KapStone RSU awards — $829,255.

2018 Compensation Program for Non-Employee Directors

In anticipation of the mergers, for 2018 KapStone modified its compensation program for non-employee
directors to consist entirely of cash awards, rather than a mix of cash and equity-based awards. Under this
modified program, each non-employee director will be eligible to receive a total cash award for 2018 of 
$180,000 (or, with respect to the chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and
Governance Committee, $200,000, $195,000 and $190,000, respectively). $90,000 of the total cash award
(referred to as the substitute cash amount) is intended to be a substitute for the equity-based awards historically
granted to non-employee directors and will be payable in quarterly installments in arrears (subject to the
director’s continued service on the KapStone board); however, upon the effective time (or, if earlier, a director’s
death, disability or retirement from the KapStone board), the director will be entitled to receive the full unpaid
amount of the substitute cash amount. The remainder of the total cash award (referred to as the normal cash
amount) will also be payable in quarterly installments in arrears (subject to the director’s continued service on the
KapStone board); however, upon the effective time (or, if earlier, a director’s death, disability or retirement from
the KapStone board), a director will be entitled to receive only a pro-rated amount of the normal cash amount
payable in respect of the quarter during which the effective time (or, if earlier, the director’s death, disability or
retirement from the KapStone board) occurs (determined based on the number of days elapsed in such quarter up
to and including the closing date (or, if earlier, the date of the director’s cessation of service on the KapStone
board due to death, disability or retirement)). None of KapStone’s non-employee directors will receive a grant of
KapStone equity-based awards for 2018. Based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain
Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate value of the cash payments to be made to KapStone non-employee
directors at the effective time in respect of the director compensation program (excluding any earned but, prior to
the effective time, unpaid amounts in respect of the normal cash amount) is $405,000.

KapStone Change in Control Severance Agreements

In connection with the mergers, KapStone has entered into change in control severance agreements with
Andrea K. Tarbox, Randy J. Nebel, Wilbur G. Kessinger and five other executive officers that provide for the
severance payments and benefits described below upon a termination of the executive’s employment by
KapStone or any of its affiliates without “cause” or a resignation by the executive officer for “good reason” (in
each case as defined in the applicable change in control severance agreement, but which definitions are consistent
with those described below in “— The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and Employee
Stock Purchase Plans”) (referred to as a qualifying termination) during the one-year period following the
effective time. The payments and benefits described below are contingent upon the executive officer’s execution
and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of KapStone and its affiliates (which release will include an
employee and customer non-solicitation obligation lasting for six months following the date of termination). If
the mergers are not successfully completed for any reason, the executive officers will not be entitled to any
payment or benefit under the change in control severance agreements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Severance Payment.   Each eligible executive officer of KapStone who experiences a qualifying termination
would, contingent upon satisfying the release requirement, receive a cash severance payment, payable in a lump
sum within 60 days following the date of termination, in an amount equal to a fixed amount not to exceed two
times the sum of such executive’s (i) annual base salary and (ii) target annual bonus.

Health Benefits.   For the number of months immediately following an eligible executive officer’s date of
termination (not to exceed 12 months) determined by dividing (i) the lump sum cash severance payment payable
under the change in control severance agreement by (ii) the executive officer’s average monthly base salary in
effect as of the date of termination (such quotient to be rounded down to the nearest whole number), such eligible
executive officer (and his or her eligible dependents) would receive health insurance benefits substantially similar
to those provided to active KapStone employees immediately prior to the date of termination. During this period,
each executive officer will be responsible for the payment of premiums for such benefits in the same amount as
active KapStone employees. Such health insurance benefits would cease if and to the extent the executive officer
becomes eligible for similar benefits by reason of new employment.

Value of Payments.   For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that could
become payable under the change in control severance agreements to each of the named executive officers of
KapStone, see “— Quantification of Potential Payments to KapStone’s Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Mergers” below.

Based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions”, the aggregate estimated value
of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable to the other five executive officers of
KapStone party to change in control severance agreements that are not named executive officers is $2,614,032.

KapStone Success Bonus Agreements

In connection with the mergers, KapStone intends to enter into success bonus agreements with Andrea K.
Tarbox, Randy J. Nebel, Wilbur G. Kessinger and five other executive officers that would entitle each such
executive officer to a specified bonus, paid on or before the second regularly scheduled payroll date following the
effective time, if the executive officer remains employed by KapStone and its affiliates through the effective time.
If the mergers are not successfully completed for any reason, the executive officers would not be entitled to any
payment under the success bonus agreements.

Value of Payments.   For the respective amount of the success bonus payment described above that is
expected to become payable under the success bonus agreements to each of the named executive officers of
KapStone, see “— Quantification of Potential Payments to KapStone’s Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Mergers” below. The success bonus payments have not been made final and remain subject to
KapStone’s discretion (subject to a $3,000,000 limitation on aggregate success bonus payments for all KapStone
employees, pursuant to the merger agreement), but the amounts listed below, with respect to all of KapStone’s
executive officers, represent KapStone’s best estimate as to the expected success bonus payments.

Based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate amount
of the success bonus payments described above that are expected to become payable to the other five executive
officers of KapStone that are not named executive officers is $725,000.

Continuing Employee Benefits

The merger agreement provides that, for a period of at least one year following the closing date, Holdco will
provide each employee of KapStone or any of its subsidiaries (other than those employees whose terms and
conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, whose compensation and benefits
are governed by such agreements), including the executive officers of KapStone, who remains in the employment
of Holdco or any of its subsidiaries during such period (each such employee is referred to as a continuing
employee) with (i) at least the same salary, wages and incentive compensation opportunities (which may be
provided in the form of cash or equity compensation) as the salary, wages and incentive compensation
opportunities (including equity compensation) provided to such

continuing employee as of immediately prior to the closing date and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such continuing employee under the applicable
KapStone benefit plans (other than equity compensation and defined benefit plans) disclosed to WestRock in the
KapStone disclosure letter or the benefit plans of Victory Packaging, L.P. disclosed to WestRock within 30 days
of the date of the merger agreement, in each case as in effect as of immediately prior to the closing date.
Furthermore, during the one-year period following the closing date, a continuing employee’s eligibility for
severance compensation may not be reduced.

Holdco will also generally recognize each continuing employee’s years of service with KapStone and its
affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff or similar
benefits (but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accruals) under employee benefit plans and
arrangements of Holdco and its subsidiaries in which the continuing employees are eligible to participate on or
after the closing date. Holdco will generally waive (or, in the case of insured arrangements, use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive) all pre-existing condition limitations and any evidence of insurability, actively at
work or similar requirements, limitations or exclusions and will also recognize (for purposes of annual deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under any health, dental and vision plans applicable to continuing employees) deductible
and out-of-pocket expenses paid by continuing employees and their respective spouses and dependents under the
benefit plans of KapStone and its affiliates during the calendar year in which the effective time occurs.

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is filed as
Annex A hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Pro Rata 2018 Annual Bonuses

KapStone and WestRock have agreed that, if the closing date occurs in 2018, no later than 15 days following
the closing date, each continuing employee who is eligible to receive an annual bonus, including the executive
officers of KapStone, will receive a payment in respect of his or her 2018 annual bonus equal to the greater of 
(1) 150% of such continuing employee’s target bonus amount and (2) the bonus payment such continuing
employee would be eligible to receive based on actual performance, in each case, pro-rated based on the number
of days in 2018 elapsed through and including the closing date.

Value of Payments.   For the respective amount of the pro rata 2018 bonus payment described above that
could become payable to each of the named executive officers of KapStone, see “— Quantification of Potential
Payments to KapStone’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” below.

Based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions”, the aggregate estimated amount
of the pro rata 2018 bonus payments described above that would become payable to the other five executive
officers of KapStone that are not named executive officers is $750,981. As noted above, the amounts of the pro
rata 2018 bonus payments listed herein assume that the closing date occurs on August 1, 2018. If the closing date
occurs during 2018 but following August 1, the pro rata 2018 bonus payments payable to executive officers will
increase from the amounts listed herein.

Indemnification Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the KapStone board and executive officers of
KapStone will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies following the mergers. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the
section entitled “— The Merger Agreement — Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors and
Executive Officers” beginning on page 123.

Quantification of Potential Payments to KapStone’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Mergers

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K,
which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of KapStone’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers. For additional details regarding the terms of the
payments described below, see the discussion under the caption “— Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and
Officers in the Mergers” above.

• The effective time occurs on August 1, 2018, which is the assumed date of the closing of the mergers
solely for purposes of this merger-related compensation disclosure;

• Each named executive officer incurs a qualifying termination immediately upon the effective time;

• All unvested KapStone options and KapStone RSU awards expected to be held by each named
executive officer as of August 1, 2018 remain unvested as of the effective time; and

• The amounts set forth in the tables below that are based on an executive officer’s base salary or target
annual bonus are based on expected compensation levels as of August 1, 2018.

(1) Cash.   Cash compensation payable to the named executive officers in connection with the mergers consists
of the following components:

(a) Cash severance payment payable upon a qualifying termination occurring within one year following
the effective time pursuant to the change in control severance agreements, paid in a lump sum within
60 days following the date of termination (subject to the release requirement described above).

(b) Pro rata 2018 bonus payment, paid within 15 days of the effective time, based on the greater of
(i) 150% of target and (ii) actual performance, if the executive officer remains employed by KapStone
and its affiliates through the effective time. For purposes of this compensation-related disclosure, it is
assumed that pro rata 2018 bonus payouts will be based on 150% of target performance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certain of the named executive officers are generally entitled to “double-trigger” severance payments and
benefits under their change in control severance agreements upon a qualifying termination of employment
occurring within one year following the effective time, as well as vesting of certain equity-based awards upon a
qualifying termination at any time following the effective time. Under both the change in control severance
agreements and the applicable KapStone equity-based award agreements, a “qualifying termination” includes
both a termination of employment without “cause” and a resignation for “good reason” (each defined consistent
with the corresponding definitions below in “— The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
and Employee Stock Purchase Plans”). In addition, the named executive officers are entitled to “single-trigger”
payments in connection with the mergers, consisting of a pro rata 2018 bonus payment and, for certain of the
named executive officers only, a bonus payment under success bonus agreements that are expected to be entered
into prior to the effective time.

The following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that may be paid or become payable to
each of the named executive officers in connection with the mergers pursuant to all applicable compensation
plans or agreements, assuming:

The amounts shown in the tables below are therefore estimates based on multiple assumptions, including the
assumptions set forth above. As a result, the actual amounts received by a named executive officer may differ

(c) Expected cash bonus pursuant to the success bonus agreements that are expected to be entered into
prior to the effective time, paid on or before the second regularly scheduled payroll date following the
effective time, if the executive officer remains employed by KapStone and its affiliates through the
effective time.

(2) Equity.   Each KapStone option and KapStone RSU award held by a named executive officer that is
outstanding as of the effective time will be converted into a corresponding Holdco equity-based award upon
the effective time as described in “— The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and
Employee Stock Purchase Plans”. Pursuant to the merger agreement, all KapStone options and KapStone
RSU awards that were outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement (other than any such award held
by a non-employee member of the KapStone board) have been amended to provide for immediate vesting in
full upon a qualifying termination following the effective time. With respect to KapStone’s 2018 annual
equity grants made as of February 23, 2018 (which consisted entirely of KapStone RSU awards), two-thirds
of each such award was made subject to the same “double-trigger” vesting conditions described in the
preceding sentence. The amounts above and in the table below assume a per share price of KapStone shares
of   $35.00 (the KapStone cash consideration). Outstanding KapStone options and KapStone RSUs that are
held by Mr. Stone and Ms. Tarbox and for which the stated vesting date has not yet occurred (collectively
referred to as the retirement awards) are being treated as vested for purposes of these tables because the
applicable award agreements for the retirement awards provide for accelerated vesting upon a termination of
employment due to retirement and Mr. Stone and Ms. Tarbox are both eligible for retirement (pursuant to the
terms of the applicable award agreement). Therefore, their retirement awards have been treated as vested,
and no value is treated as being derived from a termination without “cause” or a resignation for “good
reason,” in each case following the effective time, and the acceleration values of the retirement awards have
been listed above and in the table below as zero. The respective numbers of retirement awards held by
Mr. Stone and Ms. Tarbox are as follows: (i) 176,674 KapStone options and 75,055 KapStone RSUs held by
Mr. Stone; and (ii) 67,473 KapStone options and 49,356 KapStone RSUs held by Ms. Tarbox.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The respective amounts of estimated cash severance payments under the change in control severance
agreements, pro rata 2018 bonuses and expected bonuses under the success bonus agreements for each
applicable named executive officer are shown below. Messrs. Kaplan and Stone did not enter into a change
in control severance agreement and are not eligible to enter into a success bonus agreement and are therefore
not eligible for any such payments.

(3) Perquisites/Benefits.   Named executive officers who have entered into the change in control severance
agreements are, upon a qualifying termination within one year following the effective time, entitled to
receive health insurance benefits substantially similar to those provided to active employees immediately
prior to the date of termination for the number of months immediately following an eligible executive
officer’s date of termination (not to exceed 12 months) determined by dividing (i) the lump sum cash
severance payment payable under the change in control severance agreement by (ii) the executive officer’s
average monthly base salary in effect as of the date of termination (such quotient to be rounded down to the
nearest whole number). During this period, each executive officer will be responsible for the payment of
premiums for such benefits in the same amount as active employees. Such health insurance benefits would
cease if and to the extent the executive officer becomes eligible for similar benefits by reason of new
employment. Although Messrs. Stone and Kaplan have not entered into a change in control severance
agreement and would not receive any cash severance payments in connection with their termination of
employment, they will remain eligible to receive three months of employer-subsidized COBRA continuation
coverage upon a qualifying termination of employment pursuant to KapStone’s applicable severance
policies, which subsidies in total are not expected to exceed the amounts listed below.

beginning on page 36, in each case to the extent such discussions constitute statements as to matters of U.S.
federal income tax law, constitute the opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, subject to the assumptions, qualifications
and limitations set forth below and in the tax opinion filed as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement on Form
S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part.

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the KapStone merger
to U.S. holders (as defined below) of KapStone shares.

This discussion addresses only holders of KapStone shares who hold their stock as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address
any non-income taxes or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the KapStone merger. This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to holders of KapStone shares in
light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules (including controlled foreign
corporations, passive foreign investment companies, companies that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities, insurance companies,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, persons who hold KapStone shares as part of a
hedging or conversion transaction or as part of a short-sale or straddle, certain U.S. expatriates, persons whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or persons who acquired KapStone shares pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise as
compensation). In addition, this discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax nor does it address any
tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This discussion is based on the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions, each as in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement/ prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change
could affect the validity of this discussion.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is:

If a partnership (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds KapStone shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Partners of partnerships holding KapStone shares should consult their own tax
advisors.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DISCUSSION OF ALL OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS. PLEASE
CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF
THE MERGERS, INCLUDING TAX RETURN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE
APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN INCOME AND
OTHER TAX LAWS IN LIGHT OF YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

General

WestRock and KapStone intend for the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock Merger,
to qualify as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code. It is a condition to KapStone’s obligation to
complete the KapStone merger that KapStone receive an opinion from Sidley, counsel to KapStone, or another
nationally recognized law firm, to the effect that the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock
merger, should qualify as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code.

• will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of KapStone shares for Holdco shares in the
KapStone merger;

• will have a tax basis in the Holdco shares received in the KapStone merger equal to the tax basis of the
KapStone shares surrendered in exchange therefor; and

• will have a holding period for Holdco shares received in the KapStone merger that includes its holding
period for its shares of KapStone shares surrendered in exchange therefor.

• will recognize capital gain (but not loss) equal to the lesser of   (i) the excess, if any, of the amount of
cash plus the fair market value of any Holdco shares received in the KapStone merger over the U.S.
holder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares of KapStone shares surrendered in exchange therefor and (ii)
the amount of cash received by the U.S. holder in the KapStone merger (other than cash received in
lieu of fractional Holdco shares);

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This opinion will be based on customary assumptions and representations from KapStone and WestRock, as
well as certain covenants and undertakings by Holdco, KapStone, WestRock, KapStone Merger Sub and
WestRock Merger Sub. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect,
incomplete or inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the opinion described above may be affected and the tax
consequences of the KapStone merger could differ from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. An
opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or any court, so there
can be no certainty that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinion or that a court would
not sustain such a challenge. KapStone does not intend to obtain a ruling from the IRS on the tax consequences of
the mergers. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the KapStone merger’s qualification under Section 351 of
the Code, the tax consequences could differ from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The
following discussion assumes the receipt and accuracy of the opinion described above.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the KapStone Merger to U.S. Holders of KapStone Shares

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the KapStone merger, when taken together with the WestRock
merger, to a U.S. holder of KapStone shares will depend on whether the U.S. holder receives cash, Holdco shares
or a combination of cash and Holdco shares in exchange for the U.S. holder’s KapStone shares in the KapStone
merger. At the time a U.S. holder makes a cash or stock election pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement,
the U.S. holder will not know whether, and to what extent, the proration provisions of the merger agreement will
alter the mix of consideration the U.S. holder will receive. As a result, the tax consequences to such U.S. holder
will not be ascertainable with certainty until the U.S. holder knows the precise amount of cash and Holdco shares
that the U.S. holder will receive in the KapStone merger.

Exchange of KapStone shares solely for Holdco shares

Subject to the discussion below relating to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional Holdco shares, a U.S.
holder that exchanges all of its KapStone shares solely for Holdco shares:

Exchange of KapStone shares solely for cash

A U.S. holder that exchanges all of its KapStone shares solely for cash will generally recognize capital gain
or loss measured by the difference between the amount of cash received in the KapStone merger and the U.S.
holder’s tax basis in the KapStone shares surrendered in exchange therefor. Such capital gain or loss generally
will be long term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such KapStone shares is more than one year. Long
term capital gain of certain non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals, is generally taxed at preferential rates.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Exchange of KapStone shares for a combination of Holdco shares and cash

Subject to the discussion below relating to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional Holdco shares, a U.S.
holder that exchanges its KapStone shares for a combination of Holdco shares and cash:

• will have a tax basis in the Holdco shares received equal to the aggregate tax basis of the KapStone
shares surrendered in exchange therefor, increased by the amount of taxable gain, if any, recognized by
the U.S. holder in the KapStone merger (other than with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional
Holdco shares), and decreased by the amount of cash received by the U.S. holder in the KapStone
merger (other than cash received in lieu of fractional Holdco shares); and

• will have a holding period for Holdco shares received in the KapStone merger that includes its holding
period for its KapStone shares surrendered in exchange therefor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Such capital gain or loss generally will be long term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such shares
of KapStone shares is more than one year. Long term capital gain of certain non-corporate taxpayers, including
individuals, is generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

In the case of a U.S. holder that acquired different blocks of KapStone shares at different times and at
different prices, any gain will be determined separately with respect to each block of KapStone shares, and the
cash received by such U.S. holder will be allocated pro rata to each such block of stock.

A U.S. holder should consult with its tax advisor regarding the manner in which the above rules would apply
to such U.S. holder.

Cash in Lieu of Fractional Holdco Shares

The tax treatment of cash received in lieu of fractional Holdco shares pursuant to the KapStone merger is not
entirely certain. We intend to treat the cash received in lieu of fractional Holdco shares as if the U.S. holder
received the fractional Holdco shares in the KapStone merger and then received the cash in a redemption of the
fractional Holdco shares, in which case the U.S. holder should generally recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between the amount of the cash received in lieu of the fractional Holdco shares and the U.S. holder’s
tax basis allocable to such fractional Holdco shares. It is possible, however, that the receipt of cash in lieu of
fractional Holdco shares may be treated as the receipt of cash in exchange for KapStone shares in connection
with the KapStone merger, which would be treated as described above under “Exchange of KapStone shares for a
combination of Holdco shares and cash”.

Backup Withholding

Backup withholding at the applicable rate specified in the Code may apply with respect to certain cash
payments. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should
complete and return an IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder is a “United
States person” (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and
that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding does not constitute an additional
tax, and any amounts withheld from payments to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as
a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

Reporting Requirement

U.S. holders of KapStone shares that receive Holdco shares and, upon consummation of the mergers, own
Holdco shares representing at least 5% of the total combined voting power or value of the total outstanding
Holdco shares, are required to attach to their tax returns for the year in which the mergers are consummated, and
maintain a permanent record of, a statement containing the information listed in U.S. Treasury regulations section
1.351-3. The facts to be disclosed by a U.S. holder include the aggregate fair market value of, and the U.S.
holder’s basis in, the KapStone shares, as applicable, exchanged pursuant to the mergers.

Accounting Treatment

The mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, referred to as ASC 805. U.S. GAAP
requires that one of WestRock or KapStone be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes based on

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the evidence available. WestRock will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. In identifying
WestRock as the acquiring entity, WestRock and KapStone took into account the composition of the governing
body of Holdco, and the size of each of WestRock and KapStone, as well as the fact that KapStone stockholders
will be receiving a premium over the pre-mergers fair value of KapStone shares.

Regulatory Clearances Required for the Mergers

The mergers are subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which prevents WestRock and KapStone from
completing the mergers until the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is terminated or expires, and under
the laws of certain applicable foreign jurisdictions. On February 9, 2018, WestRock and KapStone initially filed
the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (referred to as the DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (referred to as the FTC). The DOJ has taken
jurisdiction for the review of the mergers. Effective March 12, 2018, WestRock and KapStone voluntarily
withdrew their notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC. On March 14, 2018,
WestRock and KapStone refiled their notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the
FTC. On April 13, 2018, WestRock and KapStone received requests for additional information and documentary
materials from the DOJ. Frequently referred to as a second request, the requests extend the waiting period under
the HSR Act until 30 days after WestRock and KapStone have each substantially complied with the second
request, unless that waiting period is extended voluntarily by the parties or the waiting period is otherwise
terminated by the DOJ. However, the DOJ and others may challenge the mergers on antitrust grounds even after
expiration or termination of the waiting period. At any time before or after the completion of the mergers, any of
the DOJ, the FTC or another person could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable
in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the mergers, seeking a
rescission or other unwinding of the mergers, or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or
conditions. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the mergers will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,
it will not succeed.

WestRock and KapStone have received clearance for the mergers from the Austrian, German and Mexican
regulatory authorities.

Each of KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub will take or cause
to be taken as promptly as practicable all actions necessary to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under any regulatory law. However, the merger
agreement provides that neither WestRock nor KapStone will be required to make any divestitures or agree to any
restrictions required by regulatory authorities if such action, taken together with all other such actions, would
require (i) the divestiture of any mill that had annual production capacity as of September 30, 2017 of more than
600,000 tons of product (in the case of a mill owned by WestRock, as disclosed in the most recent Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed by WestRock with the SEC as of the date of the merger agreement) or (ii) any such actions
(without giving effect to such an action contemplated by clause (i)) that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on KapStone, WestRock and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that
for purposes of determining whether such actions with respect to any products, services, assets, businesses or
contractual arrangements of KapStone, WestRock or their respective subsidiaries would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on KapStone, WestRock and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
KapStone, WestRock and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be deemed to be a company the size
of  (and with net sales and net earnings equal to the comparable financial metrics of those of) KapStone and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole). For a description of certain of WestRock’s and KapStone’s specific obligations in
the merger agreement related to regulatory clearances, see the section entitled “— The Merger Agreement — 
Antitrust Filings and Related Actions”, beginning on page 122.

While WestRock and KapStone expect to obtain all required regulatory clearances, we cannot assure you
that these regulatory clearances will be obtained, or that all required clearances will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the mergers, including the requirement to divest assets, or require
changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the
mergers not being satisfied. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the mergers will not be made or that, if a
challenge is made, it will not succeed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Exchange of KapStone Shares in the KapStone Merger

As of the effective time, all KapStone shares converted into the KapStone merger consideration pursuant to
the merger agreement will no longer be issued and outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate or person entered as the owner in a book-entry in respect of a share that
immediately prior to the effective time represented issued and outstanding KapStone shares converted into the
KapStone merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration in respect of the KapStone shares
represented by such certificate or book-entry share upon the surrender or transfer thereof in accordance with the
merger agreement provisions regarding the exchange of certificates or book-entry shares and any dividends or
other distributions provided for in the provisions of the merger agreement described under “— The Merger
Agreement — Exchange Procedures”, beginning on page 104.

No dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco shares issued in connection with the KapStone
merger will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered KapStone share until such time as the certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in respect of a KapStone share represented by a certificate is surrendered or the
book-entry share is transferred for exchange, in each case as provided in the merger agreement.

Each holder of KapStone shares converted into the KapStone stock consideration who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a Holdco share will receive, in lieu of such fractional share, a cash payment,
without interest thereon, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

If any certificate representing KapStone shares is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdco or the
exchange agent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Holdco or the
exchange agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
certificate, the exchange agent will, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, issue the applicable
KapStone merger consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case that would be payable or
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the merger agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate been
surrendered.

Each of Holdco, WestRock, KapStone, WestRock Merger Sub, KapStone Merger Sub and the exchange
agent (without duplication) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of WestRock shares, KapStone shares, KapStone options or KapStone RSU awards pursuant to the
merger agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable law with respect to taxes.

Concurrently with the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, KapStone will cause an election form to
be mailed to record holders of KapStone shares as of the record date. KapStone will also make available one or
more election forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders of
KapStone shares during the period following the record date and prior to the election deadline, which is 5:00 p.m.
New York City time on September 5, 2018, the business day immediately prior to the KapStone special meeting.
Each election form will permit the holder (or the beneficial owner, through customary documentation and
instructions) of KapStone shares to specify the number of such holder’s KapStone shares with respect to which
such holder has made a stock election. Each stock election will be subject to the proration procedures described
under “— The Merger Agreement — Proration Procedures”, beginning on page 103. Any stock election will have
been properly made only if the exchange agent will have actually received a properly completed election form, in
the case of a stock election in respect of any KapStone shares represented by a certificate, together with the
applicable certificate by the election deadline. Once a KapStone stockholder properly makes a stock election with
respect to any KapStone shares, it will be unable to sell or otherwise transfer such KapStone shares, unless it
properly revokes its stock election prior to the election deadline or the merger agreement is terminated.

Dissenting shares will not be converted into the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration and
holders of such dissenting shares will be entitled to receive in lieu of the KapStone merger consideration payment
of the fair value of such dissenting shares determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL unless and
until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise

• Each KapStone option that is outstanding will be converted into an option to purchase, on the same
terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements, but subject to amendments described
below with respect to equity-based awards outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement) as were
applicable to such KapStone option immediately prior to the effective time, a number of Holdco shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of KapStone shares
subject to the KapStone option by the equity award exchange ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the
KapStone option by the equity award exchange ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any KapStone
option held by a non-employee member of the KapStone board will vest in full upon the effective time.

• Each KapStone RSU award that is outstanding will be converted into a Holdco restricted stock unit
award, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such KapStone RSU award immediately
prior to the effective time (including applicable vesting requirements, but subject to the amendments
described below with respect to equity-based awards outstanding as of the date of the merger
agreement, and including any rights in respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were accrued but
unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time), and relating to the number of Holdco shares
(rounded to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of KapStone shares subject
to the KapStone RSU award by the equity award exchange ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
KapStone RSU award held by a non-employee member of the KapStone board will vest in full upon
the effective time.

lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the effective time, a holder of KapStone
shares who wishes to exercise appraisal rights with respect thereto fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such dissenting shares will thereupon be treated automatically as if they had been converted into
and have become exchangeable for, at the effective time, the right to receive solely the KapStone cash
consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, if the merger
agreement is terminated prior to the effective time, then the right of any holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder’s dissenting shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. For more information about appraisal
rights in respect of KapStone shares, see the section entitled “— Appraisal Rights”, beginning on page 92.

Treatment of KapStone Stock Options; Other KapStone Equity-Based Awards and the KapStone ESPP

Prior to the effective time, the KapStone board or, if appropriate, any committee administering the KapStone
Paper and Packaging 2016 Incentive Plan, the KapStone Paper and Packaging 2014 Incentive Plan, the KapStone
Paper and Packaging 2006 Incentive Plan and the KapStone ESPP, each as may be amended from time to time
(collectively referred to as the KapStone stock plans), the KapStone options and the KapStone RSU awards will
take all actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to provide that immediately prior to the effective time:

Amendments to Outstanding Equity-Based Awards.   Pursuant to the merger agreement, each KapStone
option and KapStone RSU award that was outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement (other than any
such award held by a non-employee member of the KapStone board) has been amended to provide that if,
following the closing of the mergers, the employment of an award holder is terminated by KapStone or any of its
affiliates without “cause” or the award holder resigns employment for “good reason”, such KapStone options and
KapStone RSU awards will immediately vest in full.

For purposes of the amendments described above, “cause” generally means the occurrence of any of the
following with respect to the award holder: (i) conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction of a felony (other
than a traffic violation); (ii) refusal or failure to perform duties where such failure or refusal is materially
detrimental to the business or reputation of Holdco or any of its subsidiaries, except during periods of physical or
mental incapacity, and unless remedied within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof by Holdco or its
applicable subsidiary; or (iii) willful misconduct or gross negligence with respect to the award holder’s duties that
is materially detrimental to the business or reputation of Holdco or any of its subsidiaries, unless remedied within
30 days after receipt of written notice thereof by Holdco or its applicable subsidiary.

• Each WestRock RSU award that is then outstanding will be converted into an award of restricted
stock units with respect to a number of Holdco shares, equal to the number of WestRock shares subject
to such WestRock RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such WestRock RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective
time (including any rights in respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were accrued but unpaid as of
immediately prior to the effective time).

• Each WestRock share that is subject to a WestRock restricted stock award that is then outstanding will
be converted into a Holdco share in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement relating to
the conversion of WestRock shares in the WestRock merger, but will otherwise remain subject to the

immediately prior to the effective time (including any rights in respect of dividends, if any, that are
accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of the amendments described above, “good reason” means the occurrence of any of the
following with respect to the award holder: (i) only with respect to executive officers of KapStone and its
affiliates and any other direct reports of KapStone’s Chief Executive Officer, material diminution in authority,
duties or responsibilities (or authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom such award holder
reports (which, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to KapStone’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and General Counsel includes the failure of such person to be appointed to such role with Holdco)); (ii)
diminution in base salary or incentive compensation opportunities; (iii) the relocation of the award holder’s
principal place of employment by more than 50 miles (unless the new place of employment is closer to the award
holder’s primary residence); or (iv) the material breach of any agreement between KapStone or any of its
affiliates and the award holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “good reason” will not exist unless (A) the award
holder gives written notice to Holdco or its applicable affiliate of his or her termination of employment within
30 days after the occurrence of the circumstances constituting “good reason”, and Holdco and its affiliates have
failed within 30 days after receipt of such notice to cure the circumstances constituting “good reason”, and (B)
the award holder’s “separation from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) occurs no later
than the day that is 30 days following the last day of the cure period (assuming no cure has occurred).

2018 Annual Equity Grants.   With respect to KapStone’s 2018 annual equity grants made as of February 23,
2018 (which consisted entirely of KapStone RSU awards), two-thirds of each such award was made subject to the
same “double trigger” vesting conditions described above in “— Amendments to Outstanding Equity-Based
Awards” (i.e., vesting in full upon a termination of employment without “cause” or a resignation for “good
reason” following the effective time). The remaining one-third of each such award would be forfeited upon any
termination of employment prior to the normal vesting date. None of KapStone’s non-employee directors will
receive any grant of KapStone equity-based awards for 2018, and will instead receive additional cash
compensation as a substitute for such 2018 equity-based awards.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.   Prior to the effective time, the KapStone board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the KapStone ESPP) has taken or will take all actions as it deems necessary or
appropriate to ensure that (i) the offering period under the KapStone ESPP that commenced on January 1, 2018
will be the final offering period under the KapStone ESPP, (ii) no new participants may join the KapStone ESPP
on or after the date of the merger agreement, (iii) no participant may increase the amount of his or her salary
deferrals with respect to the offering period that commenced on January 1, 2018, and (iv) the KapStone ESPP
will terminate on the earlier of  (A) immediately following the purchase date for the offering period that
commenced on January 1, 2018 and (B) two business days prior to the effective time, in which case all participant
contributions then in the KapStone ESPP will be used to purchase KapStone shares on such date in accordance
with the terms of the KapStone ESPP as if such date was the last day of such offering period, and such KapStone
shares will be no election shares.

Treatment of WestRock Options; Other WestRock Equity-Based Awards and the WestRock ESPP
Prior to the effective time, the WestRock board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any of the

plans providing for grants of WestRock equity-based awards (referred to as WestRock stock plans), the WestRock
options, the WestRock SARs, WestRock restricted stock awards and the WestRock RSU awards) will take all
actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to provide that immediately prior to the effective time:

• Each WestRock option that is then outstanding will be converted into an award of options to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such WestRock option as of immediately prior
to the effective time, a number of Holdco shares equal to the number of WestRock shares subject to
such WestRock option as of immediately prior to the effective time, at an exercise price per Holdco
share equal to the exercise price of such WestRock option.

• Each WestRock SAR that is then outstanding will be converted into an award of stock appreciation
rights, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such WestRock SAR as of immediately
prior to the effective time, corresponding to a number of Holdco shares equal to the number of
WestRock shares corresponding to such WestRock SAR as of immediately prior to the effective time, at
a base price per Holdco share equal to the base price of such WestRock SAR.

• Each WestRock director stock unit award that is then outstanding will be converted into an award of
director stock units with respect to a number of Holdco shares equal to the number of WestRock shares
subject to such WestRock director stock unit award as of immediately prior to the effective time, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to such WestRock director stock unit award as of
immediately prior to the effective time (including in respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were
accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.   Prior to the effective time, the WestRock board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the WestRock ESPP) will take all actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure
that (i) the WestRock ESPP will be assumed by Holdco (with appropriate adjustments to the terms of the
WestRock ESPP, including the securities issuable thereunder) and (ii) each outstanding purchase right under the
WestRock ESPP will be converted into a purchase right to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such purchase right as of immediately prior to the effective time, a number of Holdco shares
determined in accordance with the terms of the assumed WestRock ESPP.

Dividends and Share Repurchases

KapStone most recently paid a quarterly dividend of  $0.10 per share to its stockholders. Under the merger
agreement, KapStone may, without WestRock’s consent, continue to declare and pay its regular quarterly cash
dividend in an amount of up to $0.10 per share. KapStone declared a regular quarterly dividend of  $0.10 per
share, which was paid on July 11, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 29, 2018. The merger agreement
prohibits KapStone from repurchasing shares of its common stock (subject to certain limited exceptions) until the
earlier of the closing of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement.

WestRock most recently paid a quarterly cash dividend of  $0.43 per share to its stockholders. Under the
merger agreement, WestRock may, without KapStone’s consent, continue to declare and pay its regular quarterly
cash dividend in an amount of up to $0.43 per share, subject to increases in the ordinary course of business.
WestRock also has a stock repurchase plan that allows for the repurchase of shares of its common stock over an
indefinite period of time at the discretion of the WestRock management. In the fiscal year ended September 30,
2017, WestRock repurchased approximately 1.8 million WestRock shares. The merger agreement prohibits
WestRock from repurchasing shares of its common stock (subject to certain exceptions, including pursuant to a
customary stock repurchase plan in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act) until the earlier of the
closing of the mergers or the termination of the merger agreement.

Listing of Holdco Shares

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that the Holdco shares to be issued in connection with the
mergers be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

De-Listing and Deregistration of KapStone Shares

Following the completion of the mergers, WestRock will cause the KapStone shares to be delisted from the
NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Appraisal Rights

If the KapStone merger is completed, KapStone stockholders who have complied exactly with the applicable
requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to demand appraisal of their KapStone
shares and receive in lieu of the KapStone merger consideration a cash payment equal to the “fair value” of their
KapStone shares, as determined by the Court of Chancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, plus
interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Such appraised value may be greater than, the same as or less than the KapStone merger consideration.
Any KapStone stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect
such rights. KapStone stockholders should note that opinions of investment banking firms as to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the KapStone merger, are not
opinions as to, and do not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS NOT A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE LAW
PERTAINING TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL AND IS QUALIFIED
IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE FULL TEXT OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, WHICH IS ATTACHED
TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX D AND IS INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE HEREIN. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY LEGAL OR
OTHER ADVICE NOR DOES IT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION THAT KAPSTONE
STOCKHOLDERS EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. ALL
REFERENCES IN SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL AND IN THIS SUMMARY TO A “STOCKHOLDER”
ARE TO THE RECORD HOLDER OF KAPSTONE SHARES.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, if the KapStone merger is completed, holders of record of KapStone shares
immediately prior to the effective time who (i) do not cast their vote in favor of the KapStone merger proposal,
(ii) continuously hold their KapStone shares through the effective time and (iii) comply exactly with all of the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their KapStone shares appraised by the
Court of Chancery and to receive in lieu of the KapStone merger consideration, a cash payment equal to the “fair
value” of such shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
KapStone merger, together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value, as determined by
such court and subject to Section 262 of the DGCL.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, KapStone is required not less than 20 days before the KapStone special
meeting to notify each of the holders of KapStone shares who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of such KapStone shares, and is required to include in such notice a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes a formal notice of appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D. Any holder of KapStone shares who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights,
or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review the following discussion and Annex D
carefully because failure to comply exactly with all of the procedures specified will result in a termination or loss
of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Under Delaware law, the procedures to properly demand and perfect appraisal rights must be carried out by
and in the name of those registered as the holders of record of KapStone shares. Stockholders who are the
beneficial owners but not the holders of record of KapStone shares (such as KapStone shares held in the name of
a bank, broker or other nominee) and who wish to demand appraisal of their KapStone shares held beneficially
but not of record, are advised to consult promptly with the holders of record as to the timely exercise of such
rights and to cause such holders of record to make the appropriate demand and to otherwise comply exactly with
the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL.

• NOT vote such KapStone shares “FOR” the KapStone merger proposal;

• deliver a written demand for appraisal of such KapStone shares that complies exactly with Section 262
of the DGCL before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the special
meeting, as described further below under “— Written Demand by the Record Holder”, to KapStone at
1101 Skokie Boulevard, Suite 300 Northbrook, IL 60062, Attention: Corporate Secretary, which
demand must reasonably inform KapStone of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder is
demanding appraisal; and

• continuously hold of record such KapStone shares through the effective time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE TO COMPLY EXACTLY WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL WILL RESULT IN A TERMINATION OR LOSS OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL.

Any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal counsel before attempting to
exercise such rights.

If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do
ALL of the following:

Any stockholder who votes “FOR” the KapStone merger proposal will not be entitled to exercise
appraisal rights with respect thereto but rather, will receive the KapStone merger consideration in respect
of its KapStone shares, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement.

The right to appraisal will be terminated or lost unless it is perfected by complying exactly with all of the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, the text of which is set forth in full in Annex D hereto. Mere
failure to execute and return a letter of transmittal to the exchange agent, or failure to deliver certificates
representing KapStone shares to the exchange agent, as the case may be, does NOT by itself satisfy the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Rather, a separate written demand for appraisal must be properly
executed and delivered to KapStone as described herein.

Written Demand by the Record Holder

As provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, failure of a stockholder to make a written demand for
appraisal (or failure of a beneficial owner of KapStone shares to cause the record holder of such KapStone shares
to demand an appraisal of such KapStone shares) within the time limits provided in Section 262 of the DGCL
will result in the loss of such stockholder’s appraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be executed
by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it
appears on the certificate or certificates representing such KapStone shares that represent such stockholder’s
KapStone shares or in the book-entry that represents such stockholder’s KapStone shares, as the case may be. If
such KapStone shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, executor,
administrator, guardian or attorney-in-fact, execution of the demand must be made in such capacity, and if such
KapStone shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,
the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one of two or more joint
owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; provided, however, that the agent must
identify the record owner(s) and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as
agent for the record owner(s).

A record holder, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds KapStone shares as a nominee for
others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to such KapStone shares held for all or less than all beneficial
owners of KapStone shares as to which such person is the record owner. In such case, the written demand must
set forth the number of KapStone shares covered by such demand. Where the number of shares is not expressly
stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all KapStone shares held in the name of such record owner.

A beneficial owner of KapStone shares held in “street name” who desires appraisal should take such actions
as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of such
shares. Securities held through banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are frequently

TABLE OF CONTENTS

deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a central security deposit, such as the Depository
Trust Company (referred to as DTC). In the case of KapStone shares held through such a central securities
depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository
nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record owner. Any beneficial holder desiring appraisal who
holds KapStone shares through a bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee is responsible for ensuring that the
demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of such shares. The beneficial holder of such KapStone shares
who desires appraisal should instruct such firm, bank or institution that the demand for appraisal must be made
by the record holder of such KapStone shares, which may be the nominee of a central security depository if such
KapStone shares have been deposited therewith. As required by Section 262 of the DGCL, a demand for
appraisal must reasonably inform KapStone of the identity of the holder(s) of record (which may be a nominee as
described above) and that such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such KapStone shares.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective time, the KapStone surviving company or any holder of KapStone shares
who has complied exactly with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights
thereunder may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery, with a copy
served on the KapStone surviving company in the case of a petition filed by a holder of KapStone shares,
demanding a determination of the fair value of such KapStone shares held by all such holders. If no such petition
is filed within the 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of KapStone shares who had
previously demanded appraisal of their shares. KapStone is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to
file such a petition. Accordingly, any KapStone stockholder who wishes to perfect such stockholder’s appraisal
rights should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights within the time and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the
effective time, any KapStone stockholder who has properly filed such petition or joined such proceeding as a
named party can withdraw his demand for appraisal and accept the KapStone merger consideration.

Within 120 days after the effective time, any holder of KapStone shares who has complied exactly with the
requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the KapStone
surviving company a statement setting forth the aggregate number of KapStone shares not voted in favor of the
KapStone merger proposal with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate
number of holders of such KapStone shares. The KapStone surviving company must mail this statement to the
requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days
after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of
KapStone shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such beneficial owner may, in such
beneficial owner’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the KapStone surviving company
the foregoing statements. As noted, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a holder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed with the Court of Chancery by a KapStone stockholder, service of
a copy thereof must be made upon the KapStone surviving company, which will then be obligated within 20 days
after such service to file with the Register in Chancery of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(referred to as the Register in Chancery) a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all KapStone
stockholders who have demanded payment for their KapStone shares and with whom agreements as to the value
of their KapStone shares have not been reached. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court of
Chancery, must give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition to the KapStone surviving
company and all of the stockholders shown on such duly verified list in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. As required by Section 262 of the DGCL, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on
such petition to determine those KapStone stockholders who have complied exactly with Section 262 of the
DGCL and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require
the KapStone stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their KapStone shares to submit their stock
certificates representing KapStone shares to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceeding and, if any such KapStone stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court of
Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, the Court of
Chancery must

TABLE OF CONTENTS

dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of KapStone shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless
(1) the total number of KapStone shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding KapStone shares or
(2) the value of the KapStone merger consideration for such total number of KapStone shares exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

After determining the stockholders entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value”
of the KapStone shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
KapStone merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except with
respect to advance payments described below, interest on the amount determined to be the fair value must accrue
from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment, must be compounded quarterly, and must
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceedings, the KapStone surviving company may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such holder of
KapStone shares), in which case interest must accrue thereafter only upon the sum of  (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the KapStone shares as determined by the Court of Chancery
and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. The KapStone surviving company is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.

Stockholders considering the exercise of appraisal rights should be aware that the fair value of their
KapStone shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as or less than
the value of the KapStone merger consideration. In determining “fair value”, the Court of Chancery must take
into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors
that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant
factors involving the value of a company”. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this
determination of fair value the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw
any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger”. In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed
Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered”. In DFC Global Corp. v. Muirfield Value Partners, L.P., the Delaware Supreme Court suggested that,
based on the facts and circumstances of the case, a merger price determined in a robust, conflict-free sale process
may be the best indicator of fair value.

The costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of
expert witnesses) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a KapStone stockholder, the Court may also order that all
or a portion of the expenses incurred by a KapStone stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal
proceeding, be charged pro rata against the value of all the KapStone shares entitled to be appraised. Absent such
an order, each party is responsible for his, her or its own expenses.

From the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262
of the DGCL will be entitled to vote such KapStone shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on any KapStone shares (except dividends or other distributions, if any, payable to
stockholders of record as of a record date prior to the effective time).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If any KapStone stockholder who demands appraisal of such stockholder’s KapStone shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, such stockholder’s right to appraisal,
as provided in the DGCL, the KapStone shares of such stockholder will be deemed converted at the effective time
into the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration, without interest thereon, subject to any taxes
required to be withheld under applicable law and follow the applicable exchange procedures in order to receive
payment of the KapStone merger consideration.

If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the KapStone stockholder delivers to the KapStone surviving
company a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and acceptance of the KapStone cash
consideration, either within 60 calendar days after the effective time or thereafter with the written approval of the
KapStone surviving company, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any KapStone stockholders,
however, without the approval of the Court of Chancery, which may be conditioned on such terms as the Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that such requirement will not affect the right of any KapStone
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered pursuant to the KapStone
merger within 60 calendar days after the effective time.

If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares in favor of the KapStone merger
proposal, and you must comply exactly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to
take any required step in connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it will result in the termination or
waiver of your appraisal rights.

The foregoing summary of the rights of KapStone stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law
does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by KapStone stockholders desiring
to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of
the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated herein by reference.

FAILURE TO COMPLY EXACTLY WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL WILL RESULT IN A TERMINATION OR LOSS OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL.

Certain KapStone Forecasts

KapStone does not as a matter of course make public forecasts as to future performance, earnings or other
results. However, in connection with the evaluation of the proposals that were submitted as described in the
section entitled “— Background of the Mergers,” KapStone’s management began preparing certain forward-
looking financial information and provided the KapStone board and KapStone’s financial advisors, non-public,
internal financial forecasts. In December 2017, WestRock and its advisors requested a financial forecast from
KapStone for 2018. The forecast for 2018 prepared by KapStone and ultimately provided to WestRock’s
management and advisors for their review, in addition to the KapStone board and Rothschild and Moelis, did not
include a containerboard price increase and did not include the impact of proposed changes to federal tax laws.
We refer to the forecast for 2018 as the 2018 Operating Plan. Later, in January 2018, KapStone developed a
seven-year financial forecast (referred to as the 2018 – 2024 forecasts and, together with the 2018 Operating Plan,
referred to as the KapStone forecasts), which assumed both a $50 per ton containerboard price increase for 2018
and the expected impact of enacted changes to the federal tax laws. With respect to 2018, the 2018 – 2024
forecasts reflect the 2018 Operating Plan with changes solely to account for the containerboard price increase and
such impact from changes to the federal tax laws. The 2018 – 2024 forecasts supersede the 2018 Operating Plan.
The 2018 – 2024 forecasts were, at the direction of the KapStone board, ultimately used by Rothschild and
Moelis in preparing their respective financial analyses. KapStone has included below a summary of the KapStone
forecasts to provide its stockholders access to certain non-public information that was furnished to the above-
referenced parties and considered by the KapStone board and Rothschild and Moelis in connection with their
respective financial analyses.

The KapStone forecasts were not prepared for the purpose of public disclosure, nor were they prepared in

TABLE OF CONTENTS

financial measures, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or U.S. GAAP. The summary of the KapStone forecasts is not
being included in this proxy statement/prospectus to influence your decision whether to vote for the KapStone
merger proposal, but because certain of the KapStone forecasts were made available to the KapStone board and
Rothschild and Moelis and, with respect to the 2018 Operating Plan, to WestRock in addition to the KapStone
board and Rothschild and Moelis. The prospective financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KapStone’s management. Ernst & Young
LLP, KapStone’s independent registered public accounting firm, has neither examined, compiled nor performed
any procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information, and accordingly, Ernst &
Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young
LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus relates to KapStone’s historical financial
information and does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

In the view of KapStone’s management, the KapStone forecasts were prepared on a reasonable basis
reflecting KapStone’s management’s best then-available estimates and judgments regarding KapStone’s future
financial performance. The KapStone forecasts were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of KapStone’s management. The KapStone forecasts reflect
various estimates, assumptions and methodologies of KapStone, all of which are difficult to predict and many of
which are beyond KapStone’s control, including, among others, assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, litigation, market and financial conditions and matters
specific to KapStone’s business, including, without limitation, assumptions that RISI North American Paper
Packaging Forecast — 15 Year from August 2017 are satisfactory assumptions for growth, price and inflation,
that the long-term profitability and returns should be modeled on KapStone’s management’s view of a sustainable
or “mid cycle” level and KapStone’s management’s belief that it has and will continue to spend capital at a
similar rate to the industry as it has historically. The 2018 – 2024 forecasts assumed (i) volume growth of 1.8%
and price growth of 1.1% compounded average growth rate (similar to RISI’s then forecasted compounded
average growth rate over 15 years) with respect to KapStone’s “Integrated Packaging” business unit,
(ii) distribution revenue growth of 5% per annum (excluding the USPS business) and approximately constant
EBITDA margins, (iii) cost inflation of 2.5% per annum, (iv) the accretive impact of capital investments,
including two box plant projects and other select upgrades to machinery and (v) a 24% effective tax rate over the
projection period reflecting the expected impact of the Tax Act. With the expected implementation of the 2018
containerboard price increase, KapStone assumed that containerboard and kraft paper capacity expansions from
industry competitors would occur, reducing both price increases and profit margins in 2021, such that the
increased EBITDA margin related to the containerboard price increase would revert to the pre-price increase
EBITDA margin by 2024. Important factors that may cause the KapStone forecasts to differ from actual results
include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to KapStone’s business (including KapStone’s
ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, the
regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the section
entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 41. The KapStone
forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the forecasts will prove to be accurate.

None of KapStone, WestRock or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the KapStone forecasts, and none
of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the KapStone forecasts to reflect
circumstances existing after the date that the KapStone forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of
future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the KapStone forecasts are shown to
be in error. Since the 2018 – 2024 forecasts cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less
reliable with each successive year. The KapStone forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date they were prepared. Except as required by applicable securities laws, KapStone does not
intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to these internal financial forecasts, even in the
event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. Since the date of the KapStone forecasts, KapStone has
made publicly available its actual results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. You should
review KapStone’s consolidated

(1) The amounts for Adjusted EBIT in the “2018 – 2024 Forecasts” columns represent the figures used by
Rothschild and Moelis, at the direction of the KapStone board and management, in the preparation of their
respective financial analyses. Adjusted EBIT is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) less stock
based compensation, Victory Packaging, L.P. long-term incentive compensation payments and depreciation
and amortization, including tax deductible amortization relating to Victory Packaging, L.P. The 2018
Operating Plan included $300 million of EBIT, which represents the calculation of EBIT by KapStone’s
management.

(2) In connection with their respective discounted cash flow analyses and as summarized in the table above, at
the direction of the KapStone board and management, each of Rothschild and Moelis used unlevered free

financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
May 4, 2018, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, for this information. None
of KapStone or its respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any
representation to any KapStone stockholder or other person regarding KapStone’s ultimate performance
compared to the information contained in the KapStone forecasts or that forecasted results will be achieved.
KapStone has made no representation to WestRock, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the

For purposes of this section entitled “— Certain KapStone Forecasts,” KapStone defines “Adjusted
EBITDA” to mean earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain non-
cash and non-recurring items (including stock-based compensation, Victory Packaging, L.P. long-term incentive
compensation payments, acquisition/closure-related expenses, Ontario plant start-up expenses in 2018 and loss on
debt extinguishment).

For purposes of this section entitled “— Certain KapStone Forecasts,” “Unlevered Free Cash Flow” is
defined to mean tax-effected EBIT plus depreciation and amortization, including tax deductible amortization
relating to Victory Packaging, L.P., less capital expenditures, changes in net working capital, and certain one-time
items, including Victory Packaging, L.P. earn-out payments in 2018 and 2019, plus net proceeds in 2018 from the
sale of the Oakland property (assuming no tax liability).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Certain of the financial forecasts are non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolated form
or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial
measures as used by KapStone may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other
companies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KapStone management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on KapStone’s on-going
operations, and believes they are useful to investors because they enable investors to perform meaningful
comparisons of past and present operating results. KapStone believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT
provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between
periods and provide for greater transparency to key measures used to evaluate the performance of KapStone.
KapStone management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT for evaluating its performance against
competitors and as a primary measure for employees’ incentive programs.

The Merger Agreement
This section describes the material terms of the merger agreement. The description of the merger agreement

in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of
the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A, and this summary of its terms are included

to provide you with information regarding its terms. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the
merger agreement by KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, KapStone Merger Sub and WestRock Merger Sub were
made solely to the parties to, and solely for the purposes of, the merger agreement and as of specific dates and
were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, KapStone Merger
Sub and WestRock Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular,
in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this
summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the
principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right
not to effect the mergers if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a
change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than
establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the
SEC and in some cases were qualified by the matters contained in the KapStone disclosure letter that KapStone
provided to WestRock (referred to as the KapStone disclosure letter) or the disclosure letter that WestRock
provided to KapStone in connection with the merger agreement (referred to as the WestRock disclosure letter),
which disclosures were not reflected in the merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement. Investors
should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of
the actual state of facts of KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, KapStone Merger Sub, WestRock Merger Sub or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

form to be mailed to record holders of KapStone shares as of the record date. KapStone will also make
available one or more election forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons
who become holders of KapStone shares during the period following the record date and prior to the
election deadline, which will be 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the business day immediately prior

TABLE OF CONTENTS

As of the effective time, all KapStone shares converted into the KapStone merger consideration pursuant to
the merger agreement will no longer be issued and outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate or person entered as the owner in a book-entry in respect of a share that

surrender thereof in accordance with the merger agreement provisions regarding the exchange of certificates or
book-entry shares and any dividends or other distributions provided for in the provisions of the merger agreement
described under “— Exchange Procedures”, beginning on page 104. If between the date of the merger agreement

shares or a different class, by reason of any bonus issue, share dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of KapStone shares, or any similar event has
occurred, then any number or amount contained in the merger agreement which is based upon the number of
KapStone shares will be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of KapStone shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by the merger agreement prior to such event; provided that with respect to equity-based
awards or purchase rights outstanding under the KapStone stock plans, any such adjustments will be made in
accordance with the applicable KapStone stock plan. None of the foregoing should be construed to permit
KapStone or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the merger agreement,
including pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreement described under “— Conduct of Business Pending
the Mergers”, beginning on page 113.

Effect on WestRock shares

At the effective time, and without any action on the part of WestRock, Holdco, the WestRock surviving
company or the holders of WestRock shares, Holdco shares or the capital stock of the WestRock surviving
company, each WestRock share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than
WestRock shares to be converted pursuant to the following sentence) will be converted into one Holdco share
(referred to as the WestRock merger consideration) as specified in Section 251(g) of the DGCL. As of the
effective time, each WestRock share that is owned by WestRock as a treasury share will be converted into one
Holdco share, to be owned by Holdco as a treasury share immediately following the effective time.

As of the effective time, all WestRock shares converted into the WestRock merger consideration will no
longer be issued and outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and each person
entered as the owner in a book-entry in respect of a share that immediately prior to the effective time represented

shares as described above) will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
WestRock merger consideration into which such WestRock shares represented by such book-entry were
converted pursuant to the merger agreement and dividends or other distributions as provided in the merger
agreement.

Election Procedures

has the right, subject to the proration procedures described below, to submit a stock election in respect of all or a
portion of its KapStone shares in accordance with the following procedures:

• Each election form will permit the holder (or the beneficial owner, through customary documentation
and instructions) of KapStone shares to specify the number of such holder’s KapStone shares with
respect to which such holder has made a stock election. Each stock election will be subject to the
proration procedures described under “— Proration Procedures”, beginning on page 102.

• Any stock election will have been properly made only if the exchange agent will have actually received
a properly completed election form, in the case of a stock election in respect of any KapStone shares
represented by a certificate, together with the applicable certificate, by the election deadline.

• WestRock and KapStone will publicly announce the anticipated election deadline at least three business
days prior thereto. If the KapStone special meeting is delayed to a subsequent date, the election
deadline will be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and WestRock and KapStone will promptly
announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled election deadline.

• Any election form may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the KapStone shares subject
thereto by the KapStone stockholder who submitted the applicable election form by written notice
received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline. If an election form is revoked, the
KapStone shares as to which such stock election previously applied will be no election shares unless a
stock election is subsequently submitted by the KapStone stockholder prior to the election deadline.

• 25% of:

• All no election shares will be converted into the right to receive the KapStone cash consideration; and

• A portion of the stock election shares (if any) of each holder of KapStone shares will be converted into
the right to receive the KapStone cash consideration. Such portion will be equal to the product of:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Proration Procedures

A KapStone stockholder’s ability to make a stock election is subject to proration procedures set forth in the
merger agreement. These procedures are designed to ensure that the KapStone stock consideration is received in
respect of no more than 25% of the KapStone shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time.

Whether a KapStone stockholder receives the amount of KapStone stock consideration requested in its
election form will depend in part on the elections of other KapStone stockholders. Even if a KapStone
stockholder makes a stock election with respect to any KapStone shares, it may not receive the KapStone stock
consideration in respect of such stock election shares. The greater the oversubscription of the stock election, the
fewer Holdco shares and more cash a KapStone stockholder making a stock election will receive in respect of its
stock election shares.

If a KapStone stockholder makes no stock election with respect to any KapStone shares and does not
properly demand appraisal in accordance with the DGCL, it will receive the KapStone cash consideration in
respect of such shares. In no event will a KapStone stockholder making no stock election with respect to its
KapStone shares receive the KapStone stock consideration in respect of any of its KapStone shares.

The maximum number of Holdco shares that may be issued as stock consideration is referred to as the
maximum stock amount. The maximum stock amount is equal to:

If the product of the aggregate number of stock election shares and 0.4981 (such product referred to as the
elected stock consideration) is greater than the maximum stock amount (such difference is referred to as the
excess amount), then:

• a fraction equal to:

the remainder of such stock election shares (if any) will be converted into the right to receive the KapStone
stock consideration.

Exchange Procedures

WestRock has appointed Computershare Trust Company, N.A. as the exchange agent for the holders of
KapStone shares in connection with the KapStone merger and for the holders of WestRock shares in connection
with the WestRock merger and to receive and hold in trust the KapStone merger consideration to which holders
of KapStone shares will become entitled and the WestRock merger consideration to which holders of WestRock
shares will become entitled. At or prior to the effective time, WestRock will deposit, or cause to be deposited, and
made available for issuance with the exchange agent the Holdco shares and an amount in cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay the aggregate KapStone merger consideration for the KapStone shares converted into the right to
receive the KapStone merger consideration and the Holdco shares into which the WestRock shares will be
converted pursuant to the merger agreement (such cash and Holdco shares being hereinafter referred to as the
exchange fund). If for any reason the exchange fund is inadequate to pay the aggregate KapStone cash
consideration to which holders of KapStone shares will be entitled under the previous section, WestRock will
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional cash with the exchange agent sufficient to make all
payments of the aggregate KapStone cash consideration, and WestRock and the KapStone surviving company
will in any event be liable for payment thereof. WestRock will make available to the exchange agent, for addition
to the exchange fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional Holdco shares
in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement described under “— Fractional Holdco Shares”,
beginning on page 106.

As promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time (and in any event within three business days
after the effective time), WestRock will cause the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of KapStone
shares represented by certificates or book-entry shares not held through DTC whose shares are converted into the
right to receive the KapStone merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement a form of letter of
transmittal, together with instructions thereto advising such holder of the effectiveness of the KapStone merger
and the conversion of KapStone shares into the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration. With respect
to book-entry shares held through DTC, WestRock and KapStone will cooperate to establish procedures
regarding transmitting the applicable merger consideration and any dividends or distributions to which the
beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the merger agreement.

Upon (i) the surrender of KapStone shares represented by a certificate by physical surrender of such
certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided for below) to the exchange agent in accordance with the
letter of transmittal and accompanying instructions, (ii) the transfer of KapStone shares that are book-entry shares
not held through DTC in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal and accompanying instructions or
(iii) the transfer of KapStone shares that are book-entry shares held through DTC, including by delivery of an
“agent’s message”, in accordance with DTC’s customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by
WestRock, KapStone, the exchange agent and DTC, the holder of such KapStone shares will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) the number of Holdco shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
of Holdco shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the merger agreement and (B) the
amount, if any, that such holder has the right to

receive in cash pursuant to the merger agreement, including cash payable in lieu of fractional Holdco shares and
dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to the merger agreement. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of KapStone shares that is not registered in KapStone’s transfer records, the applicable KapStone
merger consideration may be issued to a transferee if  (1) in the case of book-entry KapStone shares, written
instructions authorizing the transfer of the book-entry KapStone shares are presented to the exchange agent, (2) in
the case of KapStone shares represented by certificates, the certificates formerly representing such KapStone
shares are surrendered to the exchange agent and (3) the written instructions or certificates, as applicable, are
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as provided in the merger agreement, each KapStone share,
and any certificate with respect to KapStone shares, will be deemed at any time from and after the effective time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the KapStone merger consideration that the holders of
KapStone shares are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to the merger agreement. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any certificate or book-entry share.

Except as provided in the merger agreement with respect to lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, no cash
payment with respect to the KapStone merger consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share
certificate or book-entry with respect to KapStone shares until the surrender of such certificate or book-entry in
accordance with the merger agreement.

None of KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub, KapStone Merger Sub, the KapStone
surviving company or the exchange agent will be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the exchange
fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any
portion of the exchange fund which remains undistributed to the holders of KapStone shares for two years after
the effective time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which such portion of the exchange fund would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any governmental entity), will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

The exchange agent will invest the cash in the exchange fund as directed by WestRock in:

Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Holdco. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the exchange fund will diminish the rights of any KapStone stockholder or
WestRock stockholder to receive the KapStone merger consideration or WestRock merger consideration or any
other payment as provided in the merger agreement, and following any such losses, WestRock will promptly
provide additional funds to the exchange agent for the benefit of the holders of KapStone shares in the amount of
any such losses to the extent that the amount then in the exchange fund is insufficient to pay the cash portion of
the KapStone merger consideration or WestRock merger consideration.

Holdco, KapStone Merger Sub, WestRock Merger Sub, WestRock, KapStone and the exchange agent
(without duplication) each are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of WestRock shares, KapStone shares, KapStone options or KapStone RSU awards pursuant to the merger
agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable law with respect to taxes. Amounts so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate
governmental entity will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

If any certificate representing KapStone shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if

required by Holdco or the exchange agent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as Holdco or the exchange agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such certificate, the exchange agent will, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, issue the applicable KapStone merger consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case
that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the merger agreement had such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate been surrendered.

Dividends on Holdco Shares

No dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco shares issued in connection with the KapStone
merger will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered KapStone share until such time as the certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in respect of such shares is surrendered or the book-entry in respect of such shares
is transferred for exchange, in each case as provided in the merger agreement. Following such surrender, subject
to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable laws, there will be paid, without interest thereon, to the record
holder of Holdco shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor:

For purposes of dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco shares, all Holdco shares to be issued
in connection with the KapStone merger and WestRock merger will be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the effective time.

Fractional Holdco Shares

Each holder of KapStone shares converted into the KapStone stock consideration who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a Holdco share will receive, in lieu of such fractional share, a cash payment,
without interest thereon, equal to the product of:

Shares of Dissenting Holders

Dissenting shares will not be converted into the right to receive the KapStone merger consideration and
holders of such dissenting shares will be entitled to receive in lieu of the KapStone merger consideration payment
of the fair value of such dissenting shares determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL.

If, after the effective time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such
dissenting shares will thereupon be treated automatically as if they had been converted into and have become
exchangeable for, at the effective time, the right to receive solely the KapStone cash consideration, without any
interest thereon. If the merger agreement is terminated prior to the effective time, then the right of any holder to
be paid the fair value of such holder’s dissenting shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease.

KapStone will give WestRock (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by KapStone for appraisal
of dissenting shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which
are received by KapStone relating to such holder’s rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the

• The KapStone options and KapStone RSU awards that were outstanding as of the date of the merger
agreement, other than any such award held by a non-employee member of the KapStone board, are
amended to provide that if, following the closing, the employment of a holder thereof is terminated by
KapStone or any of its affiliates without “cause” or the award holder resigns from employment for
“good reason”, such KapStone options and KapStone RSU awards will immediately vest in full.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any KapStone options or KapStone RSU awards held by a non-
employee member of the KapStone board will vest in full at the closing. For purposes of the second
preceding sentence:

• “cause” generally means the occurrence of any of the following with respect to the award holder:
(i) conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction of a felony (other than a traffic violation); (ii)
refusal or failure to perform duties where such failure or refusal is materially detrimental to the
business or reputation of Holdco or any of its subsidiaries, except during periods of physical or
mental incapacity, and unless remedied within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof by
Holdco or its applicable subsidiary; or (iii) willful misconduct or gross negligence with respect to
the award holder’s duties that is materially detrimental to the business or reputation of Holdco or
any of its subsidiaries, unless remedied within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof by
Holdco or its applicable subsidiary; and

• “good reason” means with respect to the award holder: (i) only with respect to executive officers
of KapStone and its affiliates and any other direct reports of KapStone’s Chief Executive Officer,
material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities (or authority, duties or responsibilities

KapStone’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel includes the
failure of such person to be appointed to such role with Holdco)); (ii) diminution in base salary or
incentive compensation opportunities; (iii) the relocation of the award holder’s principal place of
employment by more than 50 miles (unless the new place of employment is closer to the award
holder’s primary residence); or (iv) the material breach of any agreement between KapStone or
any of its affiliates and the award holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “good reason” will not
exist unless (A) the award holder gives written notice to Holdco or its applicable affiliate of his or
her termination of employment within 30 days after the occurrence of the circumstances
constituting “good reason”, and Holdco and its affiliates have failed within 30 days after receipt of
such notice to cure the circumstances constituting “good reason”, and (B) the holder’s “separation
from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) occurs no later than the day that
is 30 days following the end of the period described in clause (A).

• Each KapStone option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by
Holdco and converted into an award of options (referred to as KapStone assumed option awards) to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such KapStone option as of

nearest whole share) (i) the number of KapStone shares subject to such KapStone option as of
immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by (ii) the equity award exchange ratio, at an

discussion of acquisition proposals with third parties by any of KapStone’s officers or directors or by any other
representative of KapStone (if KapStone did not use reasonable best efforts to prevent such breach) will be
deemed to be a breach of such covenant by KapStone.

Discussions; Notice of Acquisition Proposals

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, if at any time prior to obtaining the
KapStone stockholder approval, KapStone or any of its representatives receives a written acquisition proposal
that the KapStone board reasonably believes is bona fide from any person or group of persons, which acquisition
proposal did not result from a breach of the covenant in the merger agreement prohibiting the solicitation or
discussion of acquisition proposals with third parties, and in the case of the following clauses (ii) and (iii), the
KapStone board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, based on information then available, that such
acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, then KapStone
and its representatives may (i) contact the person or group of persons who has made such acquisition proposal in
order to clarify terms for the sole purpose of the KapStone board informing itself about such acquisition proposal,
(ii) furnish, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, information (including non-public information)
with respect to KapStone and its subsidiaries to the person or group of persons who has made such acquisition
proposal; provided, that KapStone will substantially concurrently provide or make available to WestRock any
such information that is provided or made available to such person or group of persons that was not previously
provided to WestRock or its representatives and (iii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with (and only with) the person or group of persons making such acquisition proposal and their
respective representatives (in such representatives’ capacities as such).

KapStone will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) notify WestRock in writing after
receipt by KapStone or any of its representatives of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, including of the identity of the person or legal entity making such
proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions thereof  (including any subsequent changes thereto), and
will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide copies to WestRock of any written
proposals, indications of interest or draft agreements and material related documentation provided by the person
or entity making such proposal or offer or any of its representatives relating to such proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal. KapStone also agreed to keep
WestRock reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as to the status of  (including changes to any material terms or
conditions of, and any other material developments with respect to) such proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt) providing to WestRock copies of any additional or revised proposals, indications of
interest or draft agreements and material related documentation provided by the person making such proposal or
offer or any of its representatives relating to such acquisition proposal). KapStone agreed that it and its
subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of the merger agreement

agreement.

enter into any alternative acquisition agreement.

• effect an adverse recommendation change in a situation that is not in response to a superior proposal if
the KapStone board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect an adverse recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; or

• if KapStone receives an acquisition proposal that the KapStone board determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a superior proposal, authorize, adopt or approve such superior proposal and cause or permit
KapStone to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal.

• KapStone provided prior written notice to WestRock of its or the KapStone board’s intention to take
such actions at least four business days in advance of taking such action, which notice will specify

of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and the identity of, the person making the
superior proposal, or (ii) in the case of a proposed adverse recommendation change not involving a
superior proposal, the material circumstances giving rise to the adverse recommendation change (and
KapStone will keep WestRock reasonably informed of any material developments with respect
thereto);

• after providing such notice and prior to effecting an adverse recommendation change, KapStone will
have, and will have caused its representatives to, negotiate with WestRock in good faith (to the extent
WestRock desires to negotiate) during such four business day period to make such adjustments as
requested by WestRock in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as would permit the
KapStone board not to effect such adverse recommendation change; and

• the KapStone board will have considered in good faith any changes to the merger agreement or other
arrangements that may be offered in writing by WestRock by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
fourth business day of such four business day period and will have determined in good faith (i) with
respect to a proposed adverse recommendation change not based on the receipt of a superior proposal,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law not to effect the adverse recommendation change and
(ii) with respect to causing or permitting KapStone to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement
with respect to a superior proposal, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that the acquisition proposal received by KapStone would
continue to constitute a superior proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by WestRock
were given effect (provided that any amendment to any financial or other material term of such
superior proposal will require a new notice and a new two business day period).

consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) (i) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, (ii) if consummated, would be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of KapStone shares than the mergers, in each case, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such acquisition proposal and of the merger agreement
(including any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by WestRock and any fees to be paid by
KapStone pursuant to the merger agreement) and (iii) did not result from a breach (other than an immaterial
breach) of the restrictions in the merger agreement on solicitation or discussion of acquisition proposals with
third parties by KapStone or any violation of such restrictions by any director or officer of KapStone (acting in its
capacity as such) or any other representatives of KapStone if KapStone did not use reasonable best efforts to
prevent such violation.

Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub Stockholder Approval

Immediately following execution of the merger agreement, WestRock approved the merger agreement in its
capacity as sole stockholder of Holdco in accordance with applicable law and the organizational documents of
Holdco, and Holdco approved the merger agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of WestRock Merger
Sub and KapStone Merger Sub, in accordance with applicable law and the organizational documents of
WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub, respectively.

Subject to the merger agreement and notwithstanding any adverse recommendation change, KapStone will
take all necessary actions in accordance with applicable law, the KapStone organizational documents and the
rules of the NYSE to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the KapStone special meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the KapStone stockholder approval, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement

solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of the merger agreement if sufficient votes to
constitute the KapStone stockholder approval have not been obtained, but only to the extent necessary
to obtain such quorum or such sufficient votes and KapStone (unless there has been an adverse
recommendation change) uses its reasonable best efforts to obtain such a quorum or such sufficient
votes as promptly as reasonably practicable; or

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Unless KapStone and WestRock are then in negotiations as described under the caption “— Adverse
Recommendation Change; Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement”, beginning on page 118, in no event
will all such adjournments, recesses or postponements exceed ten business days in the aggregate, except as
required to comply with applicable law or the provisions of the KapStone organizational documents.

KapStone agreed that, unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, KapStone’s
obligations to hold the KapStone special meeting will not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to KapStone of any acquisition proposal or by the making of any adverse
recommendation change by the KapStone board.

Efforts to Close the Merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Takeover Laws

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, KapStone and WestRock will also each use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no takeover laws (including “fair price”,
“moratorium”, “control share acquisition” statutes or regulations) are or become applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such takeover laws and (ii) if the restrictions of such takeover law become applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by the merger agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such takeover law on the
transactions contemplated thereby.

Antitrust Filings and Related Actions

KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub agreed to:

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock

merger agreement under any regulatory law, including:

• cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a

agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a governmental entity
relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including any proceeding initiated
by a private party;

filings or submissions in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

• to the extent practicable and permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable governmental
entity or private party, as the case may be, give the other parties to the merger agreement the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The last four points in the preceding list are referred to as divestiture actions. In the event that alternative
divestiture actions would result in the parties resolving objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under any applicable regulatory law and obtaining all
consents under requisite applicable regulatory laws that may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or any
governmental entity with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to the merger agreement to
consummate the mergers and the other transactions contemplated thereby, as between KapStone and WestRock,
WestRock will be entitled to make the final determination as to which of such alternative divestiture actions to
pursue so long as such determination otherwise complies with the terms of the merger agreement.

In no event will WestRock or any of its subsidiaries be required to take, and KapStone and its subsidiaries
will not take or agree to take, any divestiture action with respect to any products, services, assets, businesses or
contractual arrangements of KapStone, WestRock or any of their respective subsidiaries if such divestiture action,
taken together with all other divestiture actions, would require (i) the divestiture of any mill that had annual
production capacity as of September 30, 2017 of more than 600,000 tons of product (in the case of a mill owned
by WestRock, as disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by WestRock with the SEC as of
the date of the merger agreement) or (ii) any divestiture actions (without giving effect to a divestiture action
contemplated by clause (i)) that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on KapStone,
WestRock and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that for purposes of determining whether
divestiture actions with respect to any products, services, assets, businesses or contractual arrangements of
KapStone, WestRock or their respective subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on KapStone, WestRock and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, KapStone, WestRock and their
respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be deemed to be a company the size of  (and with net sales and net
earnings equal to the comparable financial metrics of those of) KapStone and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).
Neither KapStone nor its subsidiaries will be required to take or agree to take any divestiture action unless the
effectiveness thereof is conditioned upon the closing, and neither KapStone nor any of its subsidiaries will take or
agree to take any divestiture action inconsistent with the preceding sentence without WestRock’s prior written
consent.

KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub will each use its reasonable
best efforts to:

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance of Directors and Executive Officers

WestRock and Holdco each agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time now existing in

TABLE OF CONTENTS

favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of KapStone and its subsidiaries as provided in
their respective organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of KapStone or
any of its subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of the merger agreement, will be assumed at the
effective time by the KapStone surviving company and will survive the KapStone merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

Following the effective time, the KapStone surviving company will, and WestRock and Holdco will cause
the KapStone surviving company to, (i) maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws to the extent they provide for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and
exculpation of each individual who was prior to the date of the merger agreement or was as of the date of the
merger agreement, or who becomes prior to the effective time, a director or officer of KapStone or any of its
subsidiaries or who is as of the date of the merger agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the effective
time, serving at the request of KapStone or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another legal entity, as
applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the effective time and (ii) to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each such individual with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the
effective time to the fullest extent permitted from time to time under applicable law (and pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel selected by such individual promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such individual upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred
(provided that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it
is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such individual is
not legally entitled to indemnification under applicable law)).

In the event that WestRock, Holdco, the KapStone surviving company or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other legal entity and is not the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, WestRock, Holdco or the KapStone
surviving company, as applicable, will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
WestRock, Holdco or the KapStone surviving company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in the
merger agreement.

For a period of six years from and after the effective time, Holdco and WestRock will cause the KapStone
surviving company to either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by KapStone or its subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for KapStone and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the
directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by KapStone in either
case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than
the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
KapStone with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the effective time (with
insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance). However, in no event will the KapStone surviving company,
WestRock or Holdco be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premium payable by KapStone for such insurance policy for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017 (referred to as the maximum amount). If such insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the maximum amount, the KapStone surviving company, WestRock or Holdco will obtain the most
advantageous policy of directors’ and officers’ insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
maximum amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the closing date KapStone may, if it has received the prior
written consent of WestRock, purchase a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy for KapStone and its current and former directors and officers who are currently
covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
KapStone, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by KapStone with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or

before the effective time. In the event KapStone purchases such tail coverage, the surviving company will cease
to have any obligations under the first sentence of this paragraph. For a period of six years from and after the
effective time, the KapStone surviving company will maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.

From and after the effective time, WestRock and Holdco will guarantee the prompt payment of the
obligations of the KapStone surviving company and its subsidiaries related to indemnification, exculpation and
insurance under the provisions of the merger agreement described in this section.

The provisions of the merger agreement related to indemnification, exculpation and insurance described in
this section (i) will survive consummation of the mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the individuals referred to in this section), his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have by contract or otherwise.

Employee Matters

For a period of at least one year following the closing date, Holdco will, or will cause its subsidiaries to,
provide each continuing employee with (i) at least the same salary, wages and incentive compensation
opportunities (which may be provided in the form of cash or equity compensation) as the salary, wages and
incentive compensation opportunities (including equity compensation) provided to such continuing employee as
of immediately prior to the closing date and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such continuing employee under the applicable KapStone benefit
plans (other than equity compensation and defined benefit plans) disclosed to WestRock in the KapStone
disclosure letter or the benefit plans of Victory Packaging, L.P. disclosed to WestRock within 30 days of the date
of the merger agreement, in each case as in effect as of immediately prior to the closing date; provided, that any
employee benefits provided by KapStone or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of applicable law
will be provided by Holdco and its subsidiaries pursuant to applicable law; provided further that, during such
one-year period, in no event will a continuing employee’s eligibility for severance compensation be reduced.

Holdco will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, credit each continuing employee for service earned on and
prior to the effective time with KapStone and its affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors, in addition to
service earned with Holdco and its subsidiaries on or after the closing date, (i) to the extent that service is
relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff or similar
benefits (but not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Holdco or any of its subsidiaries in which the continuing employees are eligible to
participate on or after the closing date (other than any such plan that as of immediately prior to the closing date is
frozen to new participants) and (ii) for such additional purposes as may be required by applicable law, in each
case, if an analogous KapStone benefit plan was in effect as of immediately prior to the closing date, to the extent
such service would have been recognized by KapStone or its applicable subsidiary under such analogous
KapStone benefit plan as of immediately prior to the closing date; provided that nothing in the merger agreement
will result in a duplication of benefits with respect to continuing employees.

Holdco will, or will cause its subsidiaries to, waive (or in the case of any insured arrangements, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive) limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions of
continuing employees and their eligible spouses and dependents and any evidence of insurability, actively at
work, or similar requirements, limitations or exclusions. Holdco will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, recognize
for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under their health, dental and vision plans applicable
to continuing employees, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by continuing employees and their
respective spouses and dependents under KapStone’s or any of its affiliates’ health plans in the calendar year in
which the effective time occurs.

Holdco will, and will cause its subsidiaries to honor the terms of KapStone benefit plans, including
KapStone’s benefit arrangements described under “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement —  Financial
Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers in the Mergers”, beginning on page 77. Bonuses for

any performance cycle that has commenced but not ended prior to the closing date will be treated as described
under “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers
in the Mergers — Pro Rata 2018 Annual Bonuses”, beginning on page 80.

Without otherwise limiting the generality of the provisions of the merger agreement relating to third party
beneficiaries, the provisions of the merger agreement related to employee benefits are for the sole benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement and nothing therein, express or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer
upon or give to any person or legal entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any continuing employee or
other current or former employee of KapStone or any of its affiliates), other than the parties to the merger
agreement and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in the provisions of the merger agreement related to
employees benefits) under or by reason of any provision of the merger agreement. Nothing in the provisions of
the merger agreement related to employee benefits will constitute or be deemed to constitute the establishment,
adoption or amendment of any KapStone benefit plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
other arrangement. Neither Holdco nor any of its subsidiaries have any obligation to continue to employ or retain
the services of any continuing employee or any other employee of KapStone or any of its affiliates for any period
of time following the closing.

Other Covenants

Access to Information; Confidentiality
Subject to applicable law and certain other limitations set forth in the merger agreement, KapStone will, and

will cause its subsidiaries to, afford WestRock and its representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours, during the period prior to the effective time, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, KapStone and its
subsidiaries will furnish promptly to WestRock (i) to the extent not publicly available, a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws or commission actions and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may be reasonably requested (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any
material respect with the normal business operations of KapStone and its subsidiaries).

Subject to certain limitations in the merger agreement, KapStone will inform WestRock as to the general
nature of any information that is being withheld pursuant to the merger agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
the merger agreement to the contrary, KapStone is not required to provide any access or make any disclosure to
WestRock to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where KapStone or any
of its affiliates, on the one hand, and WestRock or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties.

KapStone may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material to be provided to WestRock as “outside counsel only material”. Such material and the information
contained therein will be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from KapStone or its legal counsel. All information exchanged pursuant to this section is subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of December 14, 2017, between WestRock and KapStone, as amended by the
amendment thereto, dated as of December 29, 2017.

Subject to the merger agreement, KapStone will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate
with WestRock and its subsidiaries to facilitate the planning of the integration of the parties and their respective
businesses after the closing date.

WestRock will cause KapStone’s securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the

Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the effective time.

Listing of Holdco Shares
Holdco will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Holdco shares that will be issued in the Holdco stock

issuance to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Effect of Termination

In the event of termination of the merger agreement by either WestRock or KapStone as provided in the
provisions of the merger agreement described under “— Termination of the Merger Agreement”, beginning on
page 131, the merger agreement will become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the
part of KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub or KapStone Merger Sub, other than the
confidentiality provision of the merger agreement, the provisions of the merger agreement related to the effect of
termination, WestRock’s obligation to indemnify KapStone, its subsidiaries and representatives against all losses
arising out of or resulting from any cooperation pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreement described
under “— Financing Cooperation”, beginning on page 127, the provisions of the merger agreement described
under “— Termination Fee; Expense Reimbursement”, beginning on page 133, and all provisions under the final
article of the merger agreement (including amendment, extension and waiver), which provisions will survive such
termination. However, no such termination or the payment of the termination fee by KapStone to WestRock will
relieve any party from any liability or damages arising out of: (i) any willful or intentional breach of the merger
agreement by any party thereto, including any failure to consummate the closing when required to do so under
the merger agreement or (ii) the breach by WestRock of its obligation to use and cause its affiliates and its and
their representatives to use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange the debt financing of WestRock or
any of its affiliates necessary to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Termination Fee; Expense Reimbursement

Except as specifically provided for in the merger agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

KapStone will pay a termination fee of  $105,600,265 to WestRock if:

• the agreement is terminated due to the KapStone stockholder approval having not been obtained at the
KapStone special meeting, unless such special meeting has been adjourned or postponed, in which case
at the final adjournment or postponement thereof;

• the acquisition proposal is not made by the specified person or any of its affiliates and the alternative
acquisition agreement is not entered into by the specified person or any of its affiliates; and

• the acquisition proposal is withdrawn at least five business days prior to the KapStone special meeting.

• after receipt of KapStone stockholder approval, there will be made no amendment that by applicable
law requires further approval by the KapStone stockholders without the further approval of such
stockholders; and

• except as provided above, no amendment of the merger agreement will be submitted to be approved by
the KapStone stockholders unless required by applicable law.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of the immediately preceding three points, the references to 15% in the definition of
acquisition proposal of the merger agreement will be deemed to be references to 50%.

The final three points under the list of events requiring the payment of a termination fee above will not apply
if:

KapStone will reimburse WestRock’s expenses up to $17,600,104 if an acquisition proposal has been
publicly made by any person to KapStone or directly to the KapStone stockholders generally and not withdrawn
prior to obtaining the KapStone stockholder approval and KapStone or WestRock terminates the merger
agreement due to the KapStone stockholder approval having not been obtained at a duly convened special
meeting, unless such special meeting has been adjourned or postponed, in which case at the final adjournment or
postponement thereof. No reimbursement of such expenses will be required if KapStone has previously paid to
WestRock the termination fee.

If KapStone fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreement
requiring the reimbursement of WestRock’s expenses or the payment of the termination fee and, in order to obtain
such payment, WestRock commences a suit that results in a judgment against KapStone for such amounts,
KapStone will pay to WestRock its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on such amounts at the prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. In no event will KapStone be
obligated to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.

The parties to the merger agreement agreed that the payment of the termination fee will be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy available to WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub
under the merger agreement in the event the termination fee becomes due and payable and, upon payment of the
termination fee by KapStone, KapStone’s affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders and representatives will have no further liability to WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and
KapStone Merger Sub under the merger agreement, in each case except in the case of fraud or willful or
intentional breach of the merger agreement by KapStone.

Procedure for Termination

A termination of the merger agreement will, in order to be effective, require, in the case of KapStone or
WestRock, action by its board of directors or the duly authorized designee thereof. Termination of the merger
agreement prior to the effective time will not require the approval of the stockholders of either WestRock or
KapStone.

Amendment

The merger agreement may be amended by the parties thereto, in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties, at any time before or after receipt of KapStone stockholder approval. However:

• waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Extension; Waiver

At any time prior to the effective time, the parties to the merger agreement may:

No extension or waiver by KapStone will require the approval of the KapStone stockholders unless such
approval is required by applicable law. The failure of any party to the merger agreement to assert any of its rights
under the merger agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Governing Law

The merger agreement is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law.

The parties to the merger agreement agreed to irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of the merger agreement and of
the documents referred to in the merger agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. KapStone, WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger Sub and KapStone Merger Sub waived, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any right to a trial by jury in respect to any dispute arising out of or in connection
with the merger agreement or any transaction contemplated thereby.

Specific Enforcement

Each party to the merger agreement acknowledged and agreed that a breach by it of the merger agreement
would cause irreparable damage to the other parties to the merger agreement and that no party to the merger
agreement will have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, it was agreed that each party will be entitled to
specific performance and injunctive relief to prevent breaches of the merger agreement, including in the case of
KapStone, the right to specific performance and injunctive relief to cause WestRock, Holdco, WestRock Merger
Sub and KapStone Merger Sub to effect the closing in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

KapStone merger proposal. The KapStone board does not intend to propose adjournment of the KapStone special
meeting if there are sufficient votes to approve the KapStone merger proposal.

KapStone is asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by KapStone’s board to vote in favor
of any adjournment of the KapStone special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes to approve the KapStone merger proposal.

Approval of the KapStone adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
KapStone shares present in person or represented by proxy at the KapStone special meeting and entitled to vote
on the KapStone adjournment proposal.

If you are a KapStone stockholder and fail to vote, it will have no effect on the KapStone adjournment
proposal, assuming a quorum is present. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the KapStone adjournment
proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you are a KapStone stockholder and you mark your proxy card or
voting instructions to abstain, it will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the KapStone adjournment proposal.

THE KAPSTONE BOARD 
RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL 2.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) 
VOTE ON COMPENSATION

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, KapStone is
required to submit the KapStone compensation proposal to its stockholders, which is a non-binding, advisory
vote to approve the compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers.

The KapStone compensation proposal gives you the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
on the compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided to KapStone’s named
executive officers in connection with the mergers. The compensation and benefits relating to the KapStone
compensation proposal is summarized in the table in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and Officers in the Mergers”, beginning on page 77,
including the footnotes to the table. The KapStone board encourages you to review carefully the named executive
officer merger-related compensation information with respect to KapStone’s named executive officers disclosed
in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The KapStone board unanimously recommends that KapStone stockholders vote to approve the following
resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided to the
named executive officers of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation in connection with the mergers, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section of the proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “Proposal 1: The Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Financial Interests of KapStone Directors and
Officers in the Mergers”, including the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements and plans pursuant to
which such compensation and benefits that may be paid, become payable or be provided, are hereby
APPROVED.”

The vote on the KapStone compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the KapStone
merger proposal. Accordingly, a KapStone stockholder may vote to approve the KapStone merger proposal and
vote not to approve the KapStone compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the KapStone
compensation proposal is advisory only, the outcome of such vote will not be binding on KapStone or Holdco.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted by the KapStone stockholders and the mergers are
completed, the compensation and benefits with respect to the named executive officers of KapStone will be
payable or be provided, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on
the KapStone compensation proposal.

Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the KapStone compensation proposal requires the affirmative
vote of holders of a majority of the KapStone shares present in person or represented by proxy at the KapStone
special meeting and entitled to vote on the KapStone compensation proposal.

If you fail to vote, it will have no effect on the KapStone compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is
present. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the KapStone compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is
present. If you are a KapStone stockholder and you mark your proxy card or voting instructions to abstain, it will
have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the KapStone compensation proposal.

THE KAPSTONE BOARD 
RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL 3.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESCRIPTION OF HOLDCO CAPITAL STOCK

The following description of the material terms of the common stock and preferred stock of Holdco is not
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Holdco charter and Holdco bylaws. The Holdco
charter and Holdco bylaws immediately prior to the effective time will contain provisions identical to the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of WestRock immediately prior to the effective time, and the Holdco
charter will be amended to change the name of Holdco to “WestRock Company”, effective as of the effective
time. For additional information on the Holdco charter and Holdco bylaws following the mergers, see the sections
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Governing Documents; Directors and Officers — Certificates of
Incorporation and Bylaws”, beginning on page 100, and “Comparison of Rights of Holdco Stockholders and
KapStone Stockholders”, beginning on page 144.

Authorized Common Stock

Immediately following the effective time, Holdco’s authorized capital stock will consist of 600,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share (referred to as Holdco preferred stock). Following completion of the mergers, we estimate that there will be
256,528,457 Holdco shares outstanding if no holder of KapStone stockholder elects to receive stock
consideration or 269,013,537 Holdco shares outstanding if the maximum stock amount is reached and, in each
case, we expect that there will be no shares of Holdco preferred stock outstanding.

Common Stock

The Holdco shares to be issued in the mergers will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable. Each holder of a Holdco share will be entitled to one vote for each Holdco share upon all questions
presented to the Holdco stockholders, and the Holdco shares will have the exclusive right to vote for the election
of directors and for all other purposes (subject to the express terms of the Holdco preferred stock). The holders of
Holdco shares will have no preemptive rights and no rights to convert their Holdco shares into any other
securities. There will also be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Holdco shares.

Holders of Holdco shares will be entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by the
Holdco board of directors (referred to as the Holdco board) out of funds legally available therefor. Holders of
Holdco shares will be entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation or dissolution of Holdco, in all remaining
assets available for distribution to stockholders after payment or providing for Holdco’s liabilities and the
liquidation preference of any outstanding Holdco preferred stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the
holders of Holdco shares will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of any series of
Holdco preferred stock that Holdco may designate and issue in the future.

Upon completion of the mergers, it is expected that the Holdco shares will be listed for trading on the NYSE
under the symbol “WRK”. The transfer agent and registrar for the Holdco shares is Computershare Investor
Services.

Additional Classes or Series of Preferred Stock

The Holdco charter will permit the Holdco board, without further action by the Holdco stockholders, to issue
up to 30,000,000 shares of Holdco preferred stock in one or more series with such designations, powers,
preferences, special rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Holdco board may determine from
time to time. Accordingly, without action by the Holdco stockholders, the Holdco board will be able to designate
and authorize the issuance of additional classes or series of Holdco preferred stock having voting rights, dividend
rights, conversion rights, redemption provisions (including sinking fund provisions) and rights in liquidation,
dissolution or winding up that are superior to those of Holdco shares.

Charter and Bylaw Provisions; Takeover Statutes

A number of provisions in the Holdco charter, the Holdco bylaws and the DGCL may make it more difficult
to acquire control of Holdco or remove its management.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Structure of Board.   The Holdco board will not be staggered. The Holdco bylaws will provide that each
director of Holdco will hold office for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of Holdco
stockholders. The Holdco board, in accordance with the Holdco bylaws, will need to consist of a number of
directors to be determined only by resolution adopted by the Holdco board. Furthermore, any vacancies on the
Holdco board caused by death, removal, resignation or any other cause, and any newly created directorships
resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors, will be permitted to be filled only by a majority
vote of the directors then in office. This provision could prevent a Holdco stockholder from obtaining majority
representation on the Holdco board by allowing the Holdco board to enlarge the Holdco board and fill the new
directorships with the Holdco board’s own nominees.

In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the directors of
WestRock at the effective time will, from and after the effective time, be the directors of Holdco.

Removal of Directors.   The Holdco bylaws will provide that any director may be removed without cause, at
any time, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding
shares of all classes of Holdco stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holdco bylaws will provide that, until the third anniversary of the effective
time of the business combination of Rock-Tenn Company and MeadWestvaco Corporation, which anniversary
will occur on July 1, 2018, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the Holdco board will be required for
(i) the removal of Mr. Luke, or any determination not to, or failure to, nominate Mr. Luke as Non-Executive
Chairman of the Board or director and (ii) any determination not to, or failure to, nominate Mr. Voorhees as
director.

Advance Notice of Proposals and Nominations.   The Holdco bylaws will provide that Holdco stockholders
must give timely written notice to bring business before an annual meeting of the Holdco stockholders or to
nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of the Holdco stockholders. Generally, to be
timely, a stockholder’s notice will be required to be delivered to the Secretary of Holdco at the principal
executive offices of Holdco not later than the close of business on the 90  day nor earlier than the close of
business on the 120  day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, in the
event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary
date, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120
day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90  day prior to such
annual meeting or the seventh day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting
is first made by Holdco. The Holdco bylaws will also specify the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. For
additional detail on these provisions, see the section entitled “Comparison of Rights of Holdco Stockholders and
KapStone Stockholders”, beginning on page 144. These provisions may prevent Holdco stockholders from
bringing matters before an annual meeting of the Holdco stockholders or from nominating candidates for election
as directors at an annual meeting of the Holdco stockholders.

Limits on Special Meetings.   The Holdco bylaws will provide that a special meeting of the Holdco
stockholders may be called only by (i) a majority of the directors of the Holdco board then in office; (ii) the Non-
Executive Chairman of the Holdco board; (iii) the Chief Executive Officer; or (iv) the holders of at least 50% of
the outstanding voting power of Holdco shares. Business transacted at any special meeting will be limited to the
purposes specified in the notice calling such meeting.

Preferred Stock.   Holdco’s ability to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights,
privileges and preferences as the Holdco board may fix may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover
or other change of control of Holdco. See the section entitled “— Additional Classes or Series of Preferred
Stock” above.

Takeover Statutes.   Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits “business combinations”, including
mergers, sales and leases of assets, issuances of securities and similar transactions by a corporation or a
subsidiary with an interested stockholder who beneficially owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock,
within three years after the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i) the board of directors of
the target corporation has approved, before the acquisition time, either the business combination or the
transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, (ii) upon consummation of the
transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the person

owns at least 85% of the corporation’s voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors who are officers and
shares owned by employee stock plans in which participants do not have the right to determine confidentially
whether shares will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer) or (iii) after the person or entity becomes an
interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a
meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66- ⁄3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by
the interested stockholder.

Holdco does not expect to opt out of the protections of Section 203 of the DGCL. As a result, Section 203 of
the DGCL will apply to Holdco.

Exclusive Forum.   The Holdco bylaws will provide that, unless Holdco consents in writing to the selection
of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of Holdco, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other
employee of Holdco to Holdco or Holdco stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against Holdco or any
director or officer or other employee of Holdco arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Holdco
charter or the Holdco bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim
against Holdco or any director or officer or other employee of Holdco governed by the internal affairs doctrine
will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware
has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware).

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDCO STOCKHOLDERS AND KAPSTONE STOCKHOLDERS

If the mergers are consummated, KapStone stockholders who receive the KapStone stock consideration in
the KapStone merger will become stockholders of Holdco. Differences in the rights of holders of KapStone
capital stock and holders of Holdco capital stock arise from differences between their certificates of incorporation
and bylaws. As holders of Holdco shares, after giving effect to the mergers, your rights with respect thereto will
continue to be governed by Delaware law, including the DGCL, and will be governed by the Holdco charter and
Holdco bylaws. This section summarizes material differences between the rights of KapStone stockholders and
Holdco stockholders.

The following summary is not a complete statement of the rights of the stockholders of either KapStone or
Holdco or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to below. The identification of specific
differences is not intended to indicate that other equally significant or more significant differences do not exist.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL and KapStone’s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (referred to as the KapStone charter and KapStone bylaws,
respectively) and WestRock’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and
Restated Bylaws, and the description of the Holdco charter and Holdco bylaws following the mergers included in
this proxy statement/prospectus, all of which you are urged to read carefully. KapStone and WestRock have filed
with the SEC their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws and will send copies of these documents to
you, without charge, upon your request. For additional information, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find
More Information”, beginning on page 156. For additional information on the Holdco charter and Holdco bylaws,
see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement — Governing Documents; Directors and Officers — Certificates

Under the DGCL, a stockholder may dissent from, and
receive payments in cash for, the fair value of his or her
shares as appraised by the Delaware Chancery Court in the
event of certain mergers and consolidations. However,
stockholders do not have appraisal rights if the shares of
stock they hold, at the record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders to
act upon the merger or consolidation, or on the record date
with respect to action by written consent, are either (i) listed
on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by
more than 2,000 holders. Further, no appraisal rights are
available to stockholders of the surviving corporation if the
merger did not require the vote of the stockholders of the
surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by
the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares
anything other than (i) shares of stock of the surviving
corporation, (ii) shares of stock of another corporation that
will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held
of record by more than 2,000 holders, (iii) cash instead of
fractional shares or (iv) any combination of clauses (i) – (iii).
Appraisal rights are also available under the DGCL in certain
other circumstances, including in certain parent-subsidiary
corporation mergers and in certain circumstances where the
certificate of incorporation so provides.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN CANADIAN SECURITIES LAW CONSIDERATIONS

Holders of KapStone shares will, pursuant to the mergers, ultimately be entitled to receive Holdco shares or
cash, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Holdco shares will be issued pursuant to an
exemption from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws, regulations, rules and
national instruments (referred to as Canadian Securities Laws). Since WestRock is and, at the time of issuance of
the Holdco shares, will have been for more than four months, a reporting issuer in a number of Canadian
jurisdictions, and since Holdco will be the parent of the WestRock surviving company, the sale or resale of
Holdco shares issuable to holders of KapStone shares under the mergers will generally not be subject to
restrictions in Canada under Canadian Securities Laws, provided that: (i) such sale or resale is not a “control
distribution” within the meaning of Canadian Securities Laws; (ii) no unusual effort is made to prepare the
market or to create a demand in Canada for the Holdco shares; (iii) no extraordinary commission or consideration
is paid to a person or company in respect of such sale or resale; and (iv) if the selling security holder is an
“insider” (primarily including a person or company that has beneficial ownership of, or control or direction over,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting rights attached to all of Holdco’s outstanding voting securities)
or officer or director of Holdco, the selling security holder has no reasonable grounds to believe that Holdco is at
such time in default of Canadian Securities Laws.

LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Holdco shares to be issued in the KapStone merger will be passed upon by Cravath,
Swaine & Moore LLP. Certain U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the mergers will also be passed
upon for KapStone by Sidley Austin LLP.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

KapStone

KapStone will hold an annual meeting in 2019 only if the mergers have not already been completed by the
time at which such meeting would be required. If the annual meeting of KapStone stockholders is held, a
KapStone stockholder who desires to present a proposal or nomination for consideration at the 2019 annual
meeting of KapStone stockholders must follow the procedures in the KapStone bylaws governing how KapStone
stockholders can propose other business to be considered at a stockholder meeting or nominate directors. For
stockholder proposals or nominations for KapStone’s 2019 annual meeting to comply with the timeframes in
KapStone’s bylaws, the notice of such stockholder proposals or nominations must be delivered between
February 14, 2019 and March 16, 2019, unless the annual meeting takes place

TABLE OF CONTENTS

before May 15, 2019 or after July 14, 2019, in which case stockholder proposals or nominations must be received
not later than the 10th day following the earlier of  (i) the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting
was mailed or (ii) the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made. If
KapStone stockholders do not comply with these bylaw notice deadlines, KapStone reserves the right not to
submit the stockholder proposals or nominations to a vote at its annual meeting. Notice of stockholder proposals
or nominations must be addressed to KapStone at its principal executive offices at 1101 Skokie Boulevard, Suite
300, Northbrook, IL 60062, Attention: Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel.

OTHER MATTERS
At the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the only business that the KapStone board intends to present

or knows that others will present at the KapStone special meeting is as set forth above. Only such other business
shall be conducted at the KapStone special meeting as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to
KapStone’s notice of meeting in accordance with the KapStone bylaws. Nevertheless, if any other matter or
matters are properly brought before the meeting, or any adjournment thereof, it is the intention of the persons
named in the accompanying form of proxy card to vote the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best
judgment.

HOUSEHOLDING
The SEC permits KapStone to deliver a single copy of its proxy statements and annual reports to KapStone

stockholders who have the same address and last name, unless KapStone has received contrary instructions from
such KapStone stockholders. Each KapStone stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This
procedure, called “householding”, will reduce the volume of duplicate information KapStone stockholders
receive and reduce KapStone’s printing and postage costs. KapStone will promptly deliver a separate copy of this
proxy statement/prospectus to any such KapStone stockholder upon written or oral request. A stockholder
wishing to receive a separate proxy statement/prospectus can notify KapStone at KapStone Paper and Packaging
Corporation, 1101 Skokie Boulevard, Suite 300, Northbrook, IL 60062, telephone: 847-239-8800. Similarly,
KapStone stockholders currently receiving multiple copies of these documents can request the elimination of
duplicate documents by contacting KapStone as described above.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock; Treatment of Stock Owned by Company Subsidiaries.   At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of Parent, Holdco, Parent Merger Sub,
Company Merger Sub, the Company or holders of Company Shares or Parent Shares or any shares of Holdco
Common Stock or capital stock of Parent Merger Sub or Company Merger Sub:

(i) All Company Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Parent
Share that is owned by Parent as a treasury share shall be converted into one share of Holdco Common
Stock, to be owned by Holdco as a treasury share immediately following the Effective Time.

(ii) All Company Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
shall be automatically converted into the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company such
that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(c) Conversion of Company Shares.   At the Effective Time, each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance
with Section 2.01(b) and Dissenting Shares (such Company Shares, “Excluded Shares”)) shall be converted into
the right to receive the following consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02 and subject to Section 2.04
(including with respect to fractional shares):

(i) Each Company Share with respect to which no Stock Election has been validly made (a “No
Election Share”) will be converted into the right to receive $35.00 in cash, without interest thereon (the
“Cash Consideration”).

(ii) Each Company Share with respect to which a Stock Election has been validly made (a “Stock
Election Share”) will be converted into the right to receive that portion of a share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Holdco (the “Holdco Common Stock”) equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Stock
Consideration” and, together with the Cash Consideration, the “Company Merger Consideration”).

(d) As of the Effective Time, all Company Shares converted into the Company Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.01 shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a “Company Certificate”) or person entered as the owner in a
book-entry in respect of a share (a “Company Book-Entry Share”) that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive (i) the Company Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares
represented by such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share upon the surrender or transfer thereof in
accordance with Section 2.04 and (ii) any dividends or other distributions as provided in Section 2.04.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any bonus issue, share dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of Company Shares, or any similar event shall
have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of Company Shares
will be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that with respect to awards or purchase rights
outstanding under the Company Stock Plans, any such adjustments shall be made in accordance with the
applicable Company Stock Plan. Nothing in this Section 2.01(d) shall be construed to permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, including pursuant to
Section 5.01(a).

(e) Conversion of Parent Shares.   At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of
Parent, Holdco, the Parent Surviving Company or the holders of Parent Shares or shares of Holdco Common
Stock or the capital stock of the Parent Surviving Company, each Parent Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Parent Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance with
Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted into one share of Holdco Common Stock (the “Parent Merger Consideration”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

“Merger Consideration”) as specified in Section 251(g) of the DGCL. All matters pertaining to the conversion of
outstanding capital stock, and associated rights, of Parent into capital stock and associated rights of Holdco in the
Parent Merger shall be governed by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and Section 251(g) and other
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

(f) As of the Effective Time, all Parent Shares converted into the Parent Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Section 2.01 shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each person entered as the owner in a book-entry in respect of a share (a “Parent Book-Entry Share”)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Parent Shares (other than Parent Shares
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive (i) the Parent Merger Consideration into which the Parent Shares represented by such Parent Book-Entry
Share were converted pursuant to Section 2.01(e) and (ii) any dividends or other distributions as provided in
Section 2.04. As of the Effective Time, any certificate (a “Parent Certificate”) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Parent Shares (other than Parent Shares converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(b)) shall represent the shares of Holdco Common Stock into which such Parent Shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(e), as specified in Section 251(g) of the DGCL.

Section 2.02. Proration.   Notwithstanding Section 2.01(c):

(a) If the product of the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares and the Exchange Ratio (such product
being the “Elected Stock Consideration”) is greater than the Maximum Stock Amount (such difference being the
“Excess Amount”), then:

(i) all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and

(ii) a portion of the Stock Election Shares (if any) of each holder of Company Shares will be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Excess Amount and the denominator of which is the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate
number of Stock Election Shares by the Exchange Ratio, with the remaining portion of such holder’s Stock
Election Shares (if any) being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

(b) If the Elected Stock Consideration is less than or equal to the Maximum Stock Amount, then:

(i) all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and

(ii) all Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

Section 2.03. Elections.   Each holder of record of Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Election Deadline shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE II, to
submit a Stock Election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures.

(a) Concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (the “Mailing Date”), the Company
shall cause an election form in such form as Parent shall specify and that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the “Election Form”) (and which shall comply with Section 2.03(b)) to be mailed to record holders of
Company Shares as of the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall make
available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who
become holders of Company Shares during the period following the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting and prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the “Election Deadline”).

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through customary documentation
and instructions) of Company Shares to specify the number of such holder’s Company Shares with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Stock Consideration (such an election with respect to any Company
Shares, a “Stock Election”). Each Stock Election shall be subject to Section 2.02.

(c) Any Stock Election made pursuant to this Section 2.03 will have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent will have actually received a properly completed Election Form, in the case of a Stock Election
in respect of any Company Shares represented by a Company Certificate, together with the

applicable Company Certificate, by the Election Deadline. None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent
will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least three
Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. If the Company Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a
subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(e) Any Election Form may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the Company Shares subject
thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Election Form by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline. If an Election Form is revoked, the Company Shares as to which such Stock
Election previously applied shall be No Election Shares unless a contrary Stock Election is subsequently
submitted by the holder prior to the Election Deadline.

Section 2.04. Exchange of Shares.

(a) Exchange Agent.   No later than five Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/ 
Prospectus, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange
Agent”) as agent for the holders of Company Shares in connection with the Company Merger and for the holders
of Parent Shares in connection with the Parent Merger, and to receive and hold in trust the Company Merger
Consideration to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and the
Parent Merger Consideration to which holders of Parent Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(e).
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, and made available for issuance
with the Exchange Agent the shares of Holdco Common Stock and an amount in cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
pay the aggregate Company Merger Consideration for the Company Shares converted into the right to receive the
Company Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and the aggregate Parent Merger Consideration for
the Parent Shares converted into the right to receive the Parent Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(e)
(such cash and shares of Holdco Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). If for any
reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration to which holders of Company
Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(c), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments of the aggregate Cash Consideration, and Parent
and the Surviving Company shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.04(l).

(b) Letter of Transmittal.   As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each

immediately prior to such earlier date on which such portion of the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to,
or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) Investment of Exchange Fund.   The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations

Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein and following any such losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares in the
amount of any such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration.

and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Parent Shares, Company Shares, Company Options or Company Restricted
Stock Unit Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under Applicable Law with respect to Taxes. Amounts so withheld and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(j) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.   If any Company Certificate representing Company Shares shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, the posting
by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the
applicable Company Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case that would be payable
or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this ARTICLE II had such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate been surrendered.

(k) Dividends on Holdco Common Stock.   No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Holdco Common Stock issued in the Holdco Stock Issuance will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Company Share until such time as the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) is surrendered or
the Company Book-Entry Share is transferred for exchange, in each case as provided in this Section 2.04.
Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other Applicable Laws, there will be paid,
without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Holdco Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor
(i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of
Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of
such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective

Issuance will be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time.

Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a

Section 2.05. Shares of Dissenting Holders.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by holders of such Company Shares who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto
(“Dissenting Shares”) in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will not be converted into the right to
receive the Company Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive in
lieu of the Company Merger Consideration payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting
Shares will thereupon be treated automatically as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable
for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive solely the Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.05, if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Effective Time, then the right of any holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which are received by the Company relating to such holder’s
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand, and Parent will not
commit to make any such payment or enter into any such settlement prior to the Effective Time without the prior
written consent of the Company.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any of
the Company Stock Plans, the Company Options and the Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards) will take all
actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to give effect to this Section 2.06(a) to provide that immediately
prior to the Effective Time the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards are amended to
incorporate the terms and conditions described in Exhibit C and that:

(i) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is then outstanding shall be assumed by Holdco
and converted into an award of restricted stock units (each, a “Company Assumed RSU Award”) with
respect to a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock, equal to (i) the number of Company Shares subject
to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounded to the nearest whole share, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any rights in respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were accrued
but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time). For purposes of this Agreement, “Equity Award
Exchange Ratio” means a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Consideration and the denominator of
which is the average of the volume weighted average price per Parent Share on the NYSE (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and
the Company) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) Each Company Option that is then outstanding, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Holdco
and converted into an award of options to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Holdco
Common Stock equal to (rounded down to the nearest whole share) (i) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Holdco Common Stock equal to (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) (A) the exercise price of such Company Option divided by (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (each, a “Company Assumed Option Award”).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company ESPP) shall take all actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that (i) no offering period
under the Company ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) on or

number of shares of Holdco Common Stock, equal to the number of Parent Shares subject to such Parent
Restricted Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any rights in respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were accrued but unpaid
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(ii) Each Parent Share that is subject to a Parent Restricted Stock Award that is then outstanding shall
be converted into a share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.01(e) (each, a “Parent
Converted Restricted Stock Award”), but will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Parent Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any rights in respect of dividends, if any, that are accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time).

(iii) Each Parent Option that is then outstanding, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Holdco
and converted into an award of options to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such Parent Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Holdco Common
Stock equal to the number of Parent Shares subject to such Parent Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, at an exercise price per share of Holdco Common Stock equal to the exercise price of such
Parent Option (each, a “Parent Assumed Option Award”).

(iv) Each Parent SAR that is then outstanding, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Holdco and
converted into an award of stock appreciation rights, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to

respect of dividend equivalents, if any, that were accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Parent
ESPP) shall take all actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that (i) the Parent ESPP shall be
assumed by Holdco (with appropriate adjustments to the terms of the Parent ESPP, including the securities
issuable thereunder) and (ii) each outstanding purchase right under the Parent ESPP shall be assumed by Holdco
and converted into a purchase right to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
purchase right as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (x) each Company Benefit Plan that is
intended to be “qualified” within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter as to such qualification from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by
the IRS and, (y) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances or any events that have
occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of any such qualification status of any such
Company Benefit Plan. Each Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify for special tax treatment

of Parent who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of Parent.

of such tender offer or exchange offer and two days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (provided, that,
for the avoidance of doubt, a statement that the Company Board recommends against acceptance of such tender
or exchange offer but, in accordance with Section 5.02, is engaging in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such tender or exchange offer, shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) or (E) if
an Acquisition Proposal is made public, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation upon the request of
Parent within ten Business Days after Parent requests such reaffirmation (it being acknowledged and agreed that
the Company Board shall only be obligated to make one reaffirmation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and one reaffirmation with respect to any amendment thereto) (any action described in this clause (i), an
“Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) authorize, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or
permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may (I) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in a situation that is not in response to a Superior
Proposal if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or (II) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt or approve such Superior
Proposal and cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board may take the actions described in (x) clause
(II) if the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(f) concurrently with entering into
such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pays the Termination Fee in compliance with Section 8.03(b) and
(y) clause (I) or (II) if:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of its or the Company Board’s intention to
take such actions at least four Business Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify
(x) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of the Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and the identity of, the Person making the Superior
Proposal, or (y) in the case of a proposed Adverse Recommendation Change not involving a Superior
Proposal, the material circumstances giving rise to the Adverse Recommendation Change (and the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments with respect thereto) (it being agreed
that neither (x) the delivery of such a notice by the Company nor (y) the public announcement that the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) has received an Acquisition Proposal, is evaluating such
Acquisition Proposal and has delivered such notice shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change);

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such four Business Day period to make such adjustments as
requested by Parent in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not
to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change; and

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement or other
arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 PM New York City time on the fourth
Business Day of such four Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect to
a proposed Adverse Recommendation Change not based on the receipt of a Superior Proposal, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law not to effect the Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) with respect to the
actions described in Section 5.02(d)(II), after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any financial or other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice in accordance with Section 5.02(d)(i) and a new two Business Day
period).

(e) Disclosure Obligations.   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a customary “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange

Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if the

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) “Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons

more (based on the fair market value) of assets (including capital stock of the Company’s Subsidiaries) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) shares or other equity securities of the Company
which together with any other shares or other equity securities of the Company beneficially owned by such
person or group, would equal 15% or more of aggregate voting power of the Company, (b) any tender offer
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group owning, directly or indirectly,
15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company, (c) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) would
own, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving

consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) (x) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and (y) if consummated, would be more
favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Shares than the Mergers, in each case,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any fees to be
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03 and (z) did not result from a breach (other than an immaterial
breach) of Section 5.02(a) by the Company or any violation of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.02(a) by
any director or officer of the Company (acting in its capacity as such) or any other Representatives of the
Company if the Company did not use reasonable best efforts to prevent such violation.

Section 5.03. Holdco, Parent Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub Stockholder Approval.   Parent shall,
immediately following the execution of this Agreement, approve this Agreement in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Holdco in accordance with Applicable Law and the Holdco Organizational Documents, and

comments, that such party hereto or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Each party hereto and its respective counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and each party hereto shall give due consideration to the
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other party hereto and its counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.01, nothing in this Section 6.01 shall prohibit the Company or Parent
from making any filing of any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Annual Report on Form 10-K or Current Report
on Form 8-K required pursuant to the Exchange Act or any press release or public statement or filing to be issued
or made in order to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change made pursuant to and in accordance with

Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or to solicit
additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the Company

sufficient votes and the Company (unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change) uses its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such a quorum or such sufficient votes as promptly as reasonably practicable or

manner so as to not interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of the Company its
Subsidiaries); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to permit such access or make such
disclosure, to the extent that such disclosure or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such disclosure or access), (ii) result in the loss of
any attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that would not be reasonably likely to risk a loss of

without the Company’s prior written consent (provided that the Company shall not unreasonably withhold such
consent).   If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall, to the extent possible without violating an agreement or Applicable Law or risking a loss of
attorney-client privilege, inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or
make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the extent such access or information is reasonably
pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to the Parent under this Section 6.02 as
“Outside Counsel Only Material.” Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel.
All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as
of December 14, 2017, between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”). Subject to the
limitations and restrictions set forth in, and without expanding the obligations of the parties hereto under, this
Section 6.02, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Subsidiaries to facilitate the planning of the integration of the parties hereto and their respective businesses after
the Closing Date, including using reasonable best efforts to take actions prior to the Closing Date with respect to
the development, dissemination and implementation of programs as set forth on Section 6.02 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its

settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or
with any other Person, (C) selling, divesting, conveying or holding separate or otherwise taking any other action

such action, (D) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or

Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent necessary to obtain all consents that may be required under the HSR Act
or any other applicable Regulatory Laws or to resolve any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with
competent jurisdiction (all such actions referenced in clauses (B), (C), (D) and (E) are “Divestiture Actions”),
provided, however, that in the event that alternative Divestiture Actions would result in the parties resolving
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Regulatory Law and obtaining all consents under requisite Regulatory Laws that may be required by the FTC,
DOJ or any Governmental Entity with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, as between the Company and Parent, Parent shall be
entitled to make the final determination as to which of such alternative Divestiture Actions to pursue so long as
such determination otherwise complies with the terms of this Agreement. The obligations of the parties hereto to
take Divestiture Actions shall be subject to Sections 6.03(e) and 6.03(f).

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Entity by any Person in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,
the DOJ or any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any

HSR Act may be subject to reasonable redactions), and (iv) to the extent practicable and permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or private party, as the case may be, give the other parties

(e) In no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required to take, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not take or agree to take, any Divestiture Action that would result in a Burdensome Effect. For
purposes hereof, “Burdensome Effect” means any Divestiture Action with respect to any products, services,
assets, businesses or contractual arrangements of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries if
such Divestiture Action, taken together with all other Divestiture Actions, would require (i) the divestiture of any
mill that had annual production capacity as of September 30, 2017 of more than 600,000 tons of product (in the
case of a mill owned by Parent, as disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Parent with
the SEC as of the date hereof) or (ii) any Divestiture Actions (without giving effect to a Divestiture Action
contemplated by clause (i) above) that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that for purposes of determining
whether Divestiture Actions with respect to any products, services, assets, businesses or contractual arrangements
of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be deemed to be a company the size of  (and with net sales and net
earnings equal to the comparable financial metrics of those of) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take any Divestiture
Action unless the effectiveness thereof is conditioned upon the Closing, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall take or agree to any Divestiture Action inconsistent with Section 6.03(e) without Parent’s prior
written consent.

Section 6.04. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall be assumed, at the at the
Effective Time by the Surviving Company, and shall survive the Company Merger and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent and Holdco shall cause the
Surviving Company to, (i) maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws to the
extent they provide for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of each
individual who was prior to the date hereof or is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person, as applicable (each a “Company Indemnified
Party”) with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Company Indemnified Person with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted from time to time under Applicable Law (and pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Company Indemnified Parties promptly after statements
therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Company Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Applicable Law)).

(c) In the event that Parent, Holdco the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent, Holdco or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent, Holdco or the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.

(d) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Holdco and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide substitute
policies for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the
directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in either
case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than
the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time
(with insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance); provided that in no event shall the Surviving Company,
Parent or Holdco be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate
annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance policy for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017
(the “Maximum Amount”); provided, however, that if such insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium
in excess of the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Company, Parent or Holdco shall obtain the most
advantageous policy of directors’ and officers’ insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, if it has received the
prior written consent of Parent, purchase a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are currently
covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the
Company, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time. In the event the Company purchases such tail

make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law, court
process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system;

public statement previously issued or made in accordance with this Section 6.06 or as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations of a party hereto pursuant to any listing agreement between such party and any
national securities exchange; provided, further, that the Company need not consult Parent in connection with the
matters referred to in and in accordance with Section 5.02, including any press release or public statement to be
issued or made in order to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change made pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 5.02, and Parent need not consult the Company in connection with any matters referred to in
Section 5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions

Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (including equity compensation) and (ii)
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Benefit Plans disclosed to Parent in Section 3.14(a) of the

service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff or
similar benefits (but not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals) under any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date (other than any such plan that as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date is frozen to new participants) and (ii) for such additional purposes as may be required by Applicable
Law, in each case, if an analogous Company Benefit Plan was in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing

shall result in a duplication of benefits with respect to Continuing Employees.

(c) Holdco shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive (or, in the case of any insured arrangements, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive) limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions of
Continuing Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents and any evidence of insurability, actively at

their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including
with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.07) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall constitute or be deemed to constitute the establishment, adoption or
amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or other
arrangement. Neither Holdco nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue to employ or retain
the services of any Continuing Employee or any other employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates for any

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 8.01. Termination.   This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived by both the Company and Parent, but all other conditions to the

Date, and (ii) such breach or failure to be true (A) has not been cured within 30 days after written notice by the
Company to Parent informing Parent of such breach or failure to be true or (B) by its nature cannot be cured prior

contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each
case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b), as the case may be, would not be satisfied as

(g) by the Company, if  (i) all of the conditions in Section 7.01 and 7.02 (other than those conditions that by

(y) is not entered into by the Specified Person or any of its Affiliates and (Z) the Acquisition Proposal
described in clause (A) is withdrawn at least five Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

Any Termination Fee due under this Section 8.03(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in

costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating
thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section 8.03(b) or 8.03(c), as applicable, at the prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. In no event shall the Company

and Company Merger Sub under this Agreement, in each case except in the case of fraud or willful or intentional

waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless such approval is
required by Applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.06. Procedure for Termination.   A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 shall, in
order to be effective, require, in the case of the Company or Parent, action by its Board of Directors or the duly

performance and injunctive relief to cause Parent, Holdco, Parent Merger Sub and Company Merger Sub to effect
the Closing in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.02 of this Agreement. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and, subject to Section 8.03(e), shall be in addition to any other
remedies which any party hereto may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the parties hereto
expressly disclaims that it is owed any duties not expressly set forth in this Agreement, and waives and releases
any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A 

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of January 28, 2018 by and

a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Holdco”), Kola Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Company Merger Sub”), Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc., a

entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof  (as it may be amended from time to
time, the “Merger Agreement”), which provides for, among other things, the merger of Company Merger Sub
with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger (the “Company Merger”) and pursuant to
which all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to

Consideration”).

WHEREAS the Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) of that number of Company Shares (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) set forth below the Stockholder’s name on the signature page to this Agreement.

WHEREAS as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent, Holdco, Company Merger Sub and
Parent Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder (in the Stockholder’s capacity as a
stockholder of the Company) has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Certain Definitions.   All capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following respective meanings:

(a) “Expiration Date” shall mean the earliest to occur of  (i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement
shall have been validly terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof, (ii) the Effective Date and (iii) the date of any
amendment to, or waiver or modification of, the Merger Agreement that extends the End Date or reduces the
amount or changes the form of the Company Merger Consideration payable to stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the Merger Agreement if, in the case of this clause (iii), Stockholder has abstained from voting on or
voted against such matter in Stockholder’s capacity as a director of the Company.

(b) “Shares” shall mean (i) all equity securities and equity interests of the Company (including Company

2. Transfer of Shares.

(a) Transfer Restrictions.   During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not Transfer (or cause
or permit the Transfer of) any of the Shares or any rights to acquire any equity securities or equity interests of the
Company, or enter into any Contract (including any option, put, call or similar arrangement) relating thereto,
except with Parent’s prior written consent and in Parent’s sole discretion. Any Transfer (or purported Transfer) in
breach of this Agreement shall be null and void and of no force or effect.

(b) Involuntary Transfer.   If any involuntary Transfer of any Shares shall occur, the transferee (which term,
as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take
and hold such Shares subject to all of the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect until the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(c) Transfer of Voting Rights.   During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall not, and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates not to, (i) grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization
or consent or execute any written consent in or with respect to any or all of the Shares (other than any written
consent executed in accordance with this Agreement), with any such proxy, power-of-attorney, authorization or
consent purported to be granted being void ab initio, or (ii) deposit or permit the deposit of any of the Shares into
a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement, understanding or arrangement or create or permit to exist any lien,
adverse claim, charge, security, interest, pledge, option, proxy or any other encumbrance or restriction
whatsoever on title, transfer or exercise of any rights of an equityholder with respect to any of the Shares
(collectively, “Encumbrances”) except for any such Encumbrances that may be imposed pursuant to this
Agreement or any applicable restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act or any state securities law
(“Permitted Encumbrances”).

(d) Permitted Transfers.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder may make Transfers of Shares
(i) by will, (ii) by operation of Applicable Law, (iii) for estate planning purposes, (iv) for charitable purposes or
as charitable gifts or donations, (v) to any of its Affiliates or (vi) to the extent necessary to (A) fund a tax liability
arising from the exercise or vesting of any equity incentives in the Company held by Stockholder, including any
withholding obligations, (B) effect any net settlement or (C) pay the exercise price in respect, of any such equity
incentives, and in each of cases (i)-(v), the Shares shall continue to be bound by this Agreement and each
transferee thereof shall agree in a writing reasonably acceptable to Parent to be bound by the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Stockholder is not an individual, nothing in this Agreement
shall restrict any direct or indirect Transfers of any equity interests in the Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to any agreement in accordance with an Election Form, at any time
after the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, the Stockholder may Transfer, or enter into
any contract with respect to any Transfer of, all or any portion of the Shares and, if as a result of such Transfer,
the Stockholder ceases to be the record or beneficial owner of such Shares, the Stockholder shall have no
obligations pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.

(e) Stop Transfer Instructions.   At all times commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and continuing until the Expiration Date, in furtherance of this Agreement, the Stockholder hereby authorizes the
Company or its counsel to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to
all of the Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of the Shares), subject to the
provisions hereof and provided that any such stop transfer order and notice will immediately be withdrawn and
terminated by the Company following the Expiration Date and shall not apply to any Transfer permitted under
Section 2(d).

(f) Acquisition of Shares.   In the event that the Stockholder acquires Shares (or any right or interest therein)
after the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall promptly deliver to Parent a written notice indicating
the number of such Shares (or right or interest therein) acquired or received.

interfere with the performance of the Stockholder’s obligations hereunder, (ii) make any representation or
warranty of the Stockholder herein untrue or incorrect or (iii) otherwise

restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Stockholder hereby agrees not to commence or participate in, and agrees to
take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or

of doubt, exercising his fiduciary duties), including by voting, in his capacity as a director or officer of the
Company, in the Stockholder’s (or its designee’s) sole discretion on any matter (it being understood that this

the Merger Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8(a) above, the Stockholder may, and may permit its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, participate in discussions and negotiations with any Person making an Acquisition
Proposal (or its Representatives) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal if  (i) the Company is engaging in
discussions or negotiations with such Person in accordance with Section 5.02 of the Merger Agreement and (ii)
the Stockholder’s negotiations and discussions are in conjunction with and ancillary to the Company’s

Section 3(a) no later than the third Business Day prior to any meeting at which the stockholders of the Company
will consider and vote on any of the matters described in Section 3(a), the Stockholder hereby irrevocably grants
to, and appoints, Parent, and any individual designated in writing by Parent, and each of them individually, as the
Stockholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution and including for purposes of
Section 212 of the DGCL), for and in the name, place and stead of the Stockholder, to vote the Shares, or grant a
consent or approval in respect of the Shares, in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The Stockholder
understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the
Stockholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable
proxy set forth in this Section 9 is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such
irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of the Stockholder under this Agreement. The
Stockholder hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and may be revoked only
under the circumstances set forth in the last sentence of this Section 9. The Stockholder hereby ratifies and

written request by Parent, as promptly as practicable execute and deliver to Parent a separate written instrument
or proxy that embodies the terms of this irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 9 and is otherwise reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proxy and appointment granted

Parent may terminate any proxy granted pursuant to this Section 9 at any time at its sole discretion by written
notice to the Stockholder.

10. Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder.   The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to
Parent as follows:

(a) Power; Binding Agreement.   In the event the Stockholder is an individual, the Stockholder has full
power and capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform his obligations hereunder. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder, and, in the event the Stockholder is an
individual and is married and the Shares constitute community property or otherwise require spousal approval in
order for this Agreement to be a legally valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, this Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder’s spouse. Assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder,
enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights
generally and by general principles of equity. In the event the Stockholder is an entity, (i) the Stockholder is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, as applicable,
(ii) the Stockholder has all the requisite power and authority necessary to enter into, execute, deliver and perform
its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the Stockholder’s execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement has been duly authorized by it and (iv) no other proceedings on the part of the Stockholder (or its
governing body, board of directors, members, stockholders or trustees, as applicable) are necessary to authorize
or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) No Conflicts; Consents.   None of the execution and delivery by the Stockholder of this Agreement, the
performance by the Stockholder of its obligations hereunder or the consummation by the Stockholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby does or would reasonably be expected to conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of  (i) any Contract to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder may be bound,
including any voting agreement or voting trust, except for violations, breaches or defaults that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) in any material respect impair or adversely affect the
ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially delay or
adversely affect the consummation of either of the Mergers, (ii) any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment,
order, statute, rule, or regulation applicable to the Stockholder or (iii) in the event the Stockholder is an entity, the
Stockholder’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents). The execution, delivery
and performance by the Stockholder of this Agreement, and the consummation by the Stockholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity.

(c) Ownership of Shares.   The Stockholder (i) is the sole record and beneficial owner of the Shares set forth
on the signature page of this Agreement, all of which are free and clear of any Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances and (ii) does not own, beneficially or otherwise, any Company Securities other than the
Shares set forth on the signature page of this Agreement.

(d) Voting Power.   The Stockholder has, and will at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting have,
sole voting power, sole power of disposition, sole power to Transfer, sole power to issue instructions with respect
to the matters set forth herein and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each
case with respect to all of the Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights, subject to
applicable federal securities laws and the terms of this Agreement.

(e) No Finder’s Fees.   No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, finder, agent or other Person is
entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial adviser’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Stockholder in his, her or its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(f) No Litigation.   There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against
the Stockholder or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Order to which the Stockholder or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in each case, for those that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
(x) in any material respect impair or adversely affect the ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially delay or adversely affect the consummation of either of the
Mergers.

(g) Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus.   None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
Stockholder for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed
with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time it is first mailed to the Stockholder, at the
time of any amendment thereof or supplement thereto and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

11. Disclosure.   The Stockholder shall permit Parent to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules
filed with the SEC, and, after providing the Stockholder with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon prior to any such publication or disclosure, any press release or other disclosure document that Parent
reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable in connection with the Mergers and any transactions related to
the Mergers, the Stockholder’s identity and ownership of Shares and the nature of the Stockholder’s
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement. The Stockholder shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, make any press release, public announcement or other public communication with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that such consent
shall not be required for any disclosure required by Applicable Law (provided that reasonable notice of any such
disclosure will be provided to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable) and nothing herein shall prohibit the
Company from making any disclosure permitted to be made pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

12. No Ownership Interest.   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any
direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. Except as provided in this
Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong
to the Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder shall be entitled to any dividends or other
distributions declared by the Company Board with respect to the Shares having a record date prior to the
Expiration Date.

13. Further Assurances.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon request of Parent, the
Stockholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary to fulfill such Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement.

14. Termination.   This Agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall terminate
and shall have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set
forth in this Section 14 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall relieve either party hereto from liability, or otherwise
limit the liability of the Stockholder, for any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by such party prior to
such termination. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Stockholder
have any personal liability for any damages resulting from a breach of this Agreement other than in connection
with an intentional and willful breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder arising out of actions taken by the
Stockholder that the Stockholder knew at such time to be in violation hereof. This Section 14 and Section 1,
Section 7, and Section 15 (as applicable) shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

15. Miscellaneous.

(a) Validity.   The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and

effect. In the event any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement to
be null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith and execute and deliver an
amendment to this Agreement in order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent permitted by law, the
original intent of the parties hereto with respect to such provision.

(b) Binding Effect and Assignment.   This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either of the
parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without prior written consent of the other.

(c) Amendments; Waiver.   This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, and the terms and
conditions hereof may be waived, only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto,
or, in the case of a waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving compliance. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any other right
hereunder.

(d) Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent shall be irreparably
harmed and that there shall be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of

prepare, at least 10 days before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote

stockholder who is present. This list shall determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.

SECTION 1.06. Quorum.   Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws
or applicable law, the holders of a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote at

new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned
meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

SECTION 1.08. Voting and Proxies.   Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled
to vote held of record by such stockholder and a proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless
otherwise provided by applicable law or in the Certificate of Incorporation. Each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person or may authorize any other person or persons to vote or act
for such stockholder by written proxy executed by the stockholder or the stockholder’s authorized agent or by a
transmission permitted by applicable law and delivered to the Secretary of the corporation. No stockholder may
authorize more than one proxy for the stockholder’s shares. Any copy, facsimile transmission or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of
the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could
be used, provided that such copy, facsimile transmission or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction
of the entire original writing or transmission.

SECTION 1.09. Action at Meeting.   When a quorum is present at any meeting, any election shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the election, and all other
matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the matter (or if there
are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, a majority
of each such class present or represented and voting affirmatively or negatively on the matter shall decide such
matter), except when a different vote is required by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws.

All voting, including on the election of directors, but excepting where otherwise required by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefor by a
stockholder entitled to vote or such stockholder’s proxy, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be
taken by ballot, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information
as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting. Every vote taken by ballot shall be counted
by an inspector or inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting. The corporation may, and to the extent
required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint
one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate
one or more persons as an alternate inspector to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate
is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting may, and to the extent required by
law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of such inspector’s duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector’s ability.

SECTION 1.10. Stockholder Action Without Meeting.   Any action which may be taken at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing,
setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum
number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. All such consents shall be filed with the Secretary of the
corporation and shall be maintained in the corporate records. Prompt notice of the taking of a corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing.

An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder, or by a
proxy holder or other person authorized to act for a stockholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated
for the purpose of this Section 1.10, provided that such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the corporation can determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the
stockholder or by a person authorized to act for the stockholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or
authorized person transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is
transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by electronic

to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present
at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in the meeting and be deemed
present in person and vote at the meeting, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by
means of remote communication, provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify
that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a
stockholder or proxy holder, (ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters
submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting
substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

SECTION 7.01. Right to Indemnification.   Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (“proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, or
as a controlling person of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized
by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended against all expenses,
liability and loss reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the
benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and administrators: provided, however, that except as provided in
Section 7.2, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with a proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such person only if  (a) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law
or by the Certificate of Incorporation, (b) the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the corporation, (c) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (d) the

indemnity agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. The rights hereunder shall be contract rights and shall include the right to be paid
expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that
the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in such person’s capacity as a
director or officer in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
should be determined by judicial decision that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this
section or otherwise.

SECTION 7.02. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.   If a claim under Section 7.1 is not paid in full by the
corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, or 20 days in the case of a
claim for advancement of expenses, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this corporation) that the claimant
has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for
the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior
to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
the claimant has met the applicable

standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the
corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has
not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon
a judicial decision that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

SECTION 7.03. Indemnification of Employees and Agents.   The corporation may, to the extent authorized
from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of related
expenses, to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with
respect to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers of the corporation.

SECTION 7.04. Non-Exclusivity of Rights.   The rights conferred on any person in this Article VII shall not
be exclusive of any other right which such persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification Contracts.   The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract
with any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or any person serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the
Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article VII.

SECTION 7.06. Insurance.   The corporation may maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at
its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether
or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

SECTION 7.07. Effect of Amendment.   Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this
Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of an indemnitee or successor thereto in respect of
any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.

Financial Officer and General Counsel includes the failure of such person to be appointed to such role with
Holdco)); (ii) diminution in base salary or incentive compensation opportunities; (iii) the relocation of the
holder’s principal place of employment by more than fifty (50) miles (unless the new place of employment is

have failed within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the circumstances constituting Good
Reason, and (B) the holder’s “separation from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) occurs
no later than the day that is thirty (30) days following the last day of the cure period (assuming no cure has

Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall not exceed the Maximum Stock Amount (as such term is defined in the
Agreement). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested our opinion as to whether the Cash
Consideration payable to the holders of Company Shares in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.

In arriving at our opinion set forth below, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed a draft of the
Agreement dated January 27, 2018; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
that we deemed to be generally relevant concerning the Company and the industry in which it operates, including
certain publicly available research analyst reports and the reported price and historical trading activity for the
Company Shares; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available
financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed generally relevant and the consideration
received in such transactions; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with
publicly available information concerning certain other public companies we deemed generally relevant,
including implied trading multiples; (v) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect
to the business, operations and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts relating to the
Company prepared by the management of the Company (the “Forecasts”); (vi) reviewed the historical trading
prices and trading activity for the Company Shares; (vii) reviewed the premia paid in certain publicly available
transactions, which we believed to be generally

relevant; and (viii) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as
we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, we have held discussions with certain
members of the management of the Company regarding the Transaction, the past and current business operations
and financial condition and prospects of the Company, the Forecasts and certain other matters we believed
necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

In arriving at our opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed, without independent
verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished or
made available to us by the Company and its associates, affiliates and advisors, or otherwise reviewed by or for
us, and we have not assumed any responsibility or liability therefor. We have not conducted any valuation or
appraisal of any assets or liabilities of the Company (including, without limitation, real property owned by the
Company or to which the Company holds a leasehold interest), nor have any such valuations or appraisals been
provided to us, and we do not express any opinion as to the value of such assets or liabilities. We have not
evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or Holdco under any state, federal or other laws
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In addition, we have not assumed any obligation to conduct
any physical inspection of the properties or the facilities of the Company. At the direction of the management of
the Company, we have used and relied upon the Forecasts for purposes of our opinion. In relying on the
Forecasts, we have assumed, at the direction of the Company, that they have been reasonably prepared based on
assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company’s management as to
the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company and that the financial results
reflected in such Forecasts will be achieved at the times and in the amounts projected. We express no view as to
the reasonableness of the Forecasts and the assumptions on which they are based. As you are aware, certain data
underlying our analysis and opinion pre-dates (and/or does not reflect the impact of) recently enacted federal tax
legislation and recently announced price increases for certain of the Company’s products.

We have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as
contemplated in the Agreement without any waiver or amendment of any material terms or conditions, including,
among other things, that the parties will comply with all material terms of the Agreement and that in connection
with the receipt of all necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the
Transaction, no material delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed. For purposes of rendering
this opinion, we have assumed that there has not occurred any material change in the assets, financial condition,
results of operations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of the most recent financial statements
and other information, financial or otherwise, relating to the Company made available to us, and that there is no
information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading. We do
not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that may result from the Transaction, nor does our
opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters. We have relied as to all legal, tax and regulatory
matters relevant to rendering our opinion upon the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with
respect to such issues. In arriving at our opinion, we have not taken into account any litigation, regulatory or
other proceeding that is pending or may be brought against the Company or any of its affiliates. In addition, we
have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final form of the Agreement will not
differ in any material respect from the draft of the Agreement reviewed by us.

Our opinion is necessarily based on securities markets, economic, monetary, financial and other general
business and financial conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and the information made available to us
as of, the date hereof and the conditions and prospects, financial and otherwise, of the Company as they were
reflected in the information provided to us and as they were represented to us in discussions with the management
of the Company. We are expressing no opinion herein as to the price at which the Company Shares or the Holdco
Shares will trade at any future time, the value of the Holdco Shares (including the value of Holdco Shares issued
as Stock Consideration pursuant to the Agreement), or whether any market would develop for the Holdco Shares.
Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a

financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Shares of the Cash Consideration payable to such holders
in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement and we express no opinion as to any underlying decisions which the
Company may make to engage in the Transaction or any alternative transaction. We do not express any opinion,
nor have we been asked by the Board to express any opinion, as to the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any alternative transaction, including any alternative transaction that the Board has considered and
elected not to pursue. We have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to the terms, other than the
Cash Consideration to the extent expressly set forth herein, of the Transaction, the Agreement or any other
agreement entered into in connection with the Transaction (including, without limitation, the fairness or value of
the Stock Consideration or the relative fairness of the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration).

We and our affiliates are engaged in a wide range of financial advisory and investment banking activities. In
addition, in the ordinary course of their asset management, merchant banking and other business activities, our
affiliates may trade in the securities of the Company, Parent, Holdco and any of their respective affiliates, for
their own accounts or for the accounts of their affiliates and customers, and may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities. We are acting as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the Transaction and
will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a portion of which is payable upon delivery of this opinion
and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. In addition, the
Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may
arise out of our engagement. We and our affiliates may in the future provide financial services to the Company,
Parent, Holdco and/or their respective affiliates in the ordinary course of our businesses from time to time and
may receive fees for the rendering of such services.

This opinion is provided for the benefit of the Board (solely in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for the purpose of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion should not be construed as creating any
fiduciary duty on our part to any party. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to
whether to approve the Transaction or a recommendation as to whether or not any holder of Company Shares
should vote, make any election or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. In addition,
the Board has not asked us to address, and this opinion does not address, (i) the fairness to, or any other
consideration of, the holders of any class of securities (other than holders of Company Shares and then only to the
extent expressly set forth herein) or creditors or other constituencies of the Company or (ii) the fairness of the
amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of
Parent, the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Cash Consideration pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise.

This opinion is given and speaks only as of the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent
developments may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not have any
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. This opinion has been approved by the Global Advisory
Commitment Committee of Rothschild Inc.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Cash
Consideration payable to the holders of Company Shares in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,

January 28, 2018 

Board of Directors
KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation
1101 Skokie Blvd., Suite 300
Northbrook, IL 60062

Ladies & Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Company Common Stock”), of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation
(the “Company”), of the Cash Consideration (as defined below) to be received by such holders pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) to be entered into by the Company, WestRock Company (the
“Acquiror”), Whiskey Holdco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Holdco”), Kola Merger Sub,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “Company Merger Sub”), and Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Parent Merger Sub”). As more fully described in the Agreement: (i) Parent
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Acquiror and Company Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company (such mergers, together with the other transactions contemplated thereby, the “Transaction”) and
(ii) each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the
Agreement), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, (A) in
the case of a share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election (as defined below) has not
been validly made, $35 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”) or (B) in the case of a share of
Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive stock is validly made (the “Stock
Election”), 0.4981 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Holdco (“Holdco Common Stock”), in
lieu of the Cash Consideration, subject to proration as set forth in the Agreement (the “Stock Consideration”),
such that the maximum aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive Holdco Common Stock does not exceed the Maximum Stock Amount (as defined in the
Agreement).

In arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to the Company, including publicly available research analysts’ financial forecasts;
(ii) reviewed certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and
prospects of the Company furnished to us by the Company, including financial forecasts provided to or discussed
with us by the management of the Company; (iii) conducted discussions with members of the senior management
and representatives of the Company concerning the information described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph,
as well as the business and prospects of the Company generally; (iv) reviewed publicly available financial and
stock market data of certain other companies in lines of business that we deemed relevant; (v) reviewed the
financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant; (vi) reviewed a draft, dated January 28,
2018, of the Agreement; (vii) reviewed a draft, dated January 28, 2018, of the form of Voting Agreement to be
entered into by the Acquiror and certain holders of the Company Common Stock (the “Voting Agreements”);
(viii) participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Acquiror
and their advisors; and (ix) conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other
information as we deemed appropriate.

In connection with our review, we have, with your consent, relied on the information supplied to, discussed
with or reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion being complete and accurate in all material respects. We have
not assumed any responsibility for independent verification of any of such information. With your consent, we
have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory
and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. With respect to the
financial forecasts referred to above, we have assumed, at your direction, that they have been reasonably prepared
on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as
to the future performance of the Company, including with respect to the effects of the recently enacted federal tax
legislation, and the recently announced price

increases for certain of the Company’s products. We express no views as to the reasonableness of any financial
forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, with your consent, we have not made any
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or
otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

Our opinion does not address the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be
available to the Company and does not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. At your direction,
we have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Agreement or any aspect or
implication of the Transaction (including, without limitation, the fairness or value of the Stock Consideration or
the relative fairness of the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration), except for the fairness of the Cash
Consideration from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock. With your consent, we
express no opinion as to what the value of Holdco Common Stock, including any shares received in connection
with any Stock Election, actually will be when issued pursuant to the Transaction or the prices at which Holdco
Common Stock may trade at any time. In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that the
final executed form of the Agreement and the Voting Agreements will not differ in any material respect from the
drafts that we have reviewed, that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with its terms without any
waiver or modification that could be material to our analysis, and that the parties to the Agreement and the Voting
Agreements will comply with all the material terms of the Agreement and the Voting Agreements, as applicable.
We have assumed, with your consent, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary
for the completion of the Transaction will be obtained, except to the extent that could not be material to our
analysis.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to update this opinion
for developments after the date hereof. As you are aware, certain data underlying our analysis and opinion pre-
dates (and/or does not reflect the impact of) recently enacted federal tax legislation. The financial and stock
markets have been adjusting to the impacts of such legislation, and we express no opinion or view as to any
potential effects of such impacts on the Company, the Acquiror or the Transaction.

We have acted as your financial advisor in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our
services, the principal portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. We will also
receive a fee upon delivery of this opinion. Our affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any time own
securities (long or short) of the Company and the Acquiror. We may in the future provide investment banking and
other services to the Acquiror and/or the Company and may receive compensation for such services.

This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in its capacity as
such) in its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
holder of securities should vote, make any election (including, without limitation, the Stock Election) or
otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. In addition, we do not express any opinion as to
the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of
any parties to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Cash Consideration or otherwise or as
to whether any of the foregoing persons should enter into the Voting Agreements or make any Stock Election.

This opinion was approved by a Moelis & Company LLC fairness opinion committee.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as the date hereof, the Cash Consideration to
be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the Transaction is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders.

Very truly yours,

/s/ MOELIS & COMPANY LLC

ANNEX D 

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

§ 262 Appraisal rights

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this
section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the
stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used
in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and
“share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions
thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to
§ 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, §
256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights
under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository
receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of
the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a
national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if
the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are
required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256,
257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares
of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares
or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §
251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal
rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by §
363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the
procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and
the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting
corporation.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply
as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to
be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or
such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which
appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are
available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy
of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of  § 114 of this
title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand.
A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided.
Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this
title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the
merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of  § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of
this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days
after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of
the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date
of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders
on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §
251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title
and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of
the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a

record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the
notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date
shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for
such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held
either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition
or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register
in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in
Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition
by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before
the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or
such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be
approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates
of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If
immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent
corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless
(1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series
eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total
number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or

consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from
the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and
shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any
time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon
the sum of  (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or
resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in
its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation
pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that
such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented
by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or
resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or
to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of
this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of
such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within
60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall
cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders
would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized
and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
