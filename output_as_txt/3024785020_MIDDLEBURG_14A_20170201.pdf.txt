PROPOSED MERGER – YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

The boards of directors of Access National Corporation and Middleburg Financial Corporation have approved a
strategic merger in which Middleburg will merge with and into Access. The combined company, which will retain the
Access name and initially conduct certain operations under the Middleburg Bank brand, is expected to have approximately
$2.7 billion in assets, $2.2 billion in deposits, $1.8 billion in gross loans and $2.5 billion in assets under management and
administration. The combined company will operate offices throughout Virginia and rank fifth in deposit market share
among Virginia-based banks under $10 billion in assets. We are sending you this document to ask you, as an Access
and/or Middleburg shareholder, to approve the merger.

In the merger, each share of Middleburg common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.3314 shares of
Access common stock. Although the number of shares of Access common stock that Middleburg shareholders will receive
is fixed, the market value of the merger consideration will fluctuate with the market price of Access common stock and will
not be known at the time the Middleburg shareholders vote on the merger. Based on the average closing sale price for
Access common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the twenty trading days ended October 21, 2016 ($24.42), the
last trading day before public announcement of the merger, the 1.3314 exchange ratio represented approximately $32.51
in value for each share of Middleburg common stock. The most recent reported closing sale price for Access common
stock on January 31, 2017, was $26.68. The most recent reported closing sale price for Middleburg common stock on
January 31, 2017, was $34.34. Based on the exchange ratio and the number of shares of Middleburg common stock
outstanding and reserved for issuance under various stock incentive plans and agreements, the maximum number of
shares of Access common stock offered by Access and issuable in the merger is 9,592,825. We urge you to obtain current
market quotations for Access (trading symbol “ANCX”) and Middleburg (trading symbol “MBRG”).

Your vote is very important. We are holding special meetings of our respective shareholders to obtain approval of the
merger agreement and related plan of merger and related matters as described in the attached joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Approval of the merger agreement and related plan of merger requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of more than two thirds of the outstanding shares of Access common stock, and the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Middleburg common stock.

Whether or not you plan to attend the Access or Middleburg special meeting, it is important that your shares be
represented at the meeting and your vote recorded. Please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed
proxy card or by voting via the Internet or telephone using the instructions given on the proxy card. Even if you return the
proxy card, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person.

The boards of directors of Access and Middleburg unanimously recommend that you vote “FOR” approval of
the merger agreement and the related plan of merger and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at each
special meeting.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the special meetings, the merger, the documents related to the
merger, and other related matters. Please carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the
information in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 28. You can also obtain information about Access and
Middleburg from documents that each has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Thank you for your support.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

The following questions and answers briefly address some commonly asked questions about the special meetings and the merger.
They may not include all of the information that is important to Access and Middleburg shareholders. We urge shareholders to read
carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the appendices and other documents referred to herein.

 
 Q: What is the merger?
 

 

A: Access and Middleburg have entered into the merger agreement whereby Middleburg will merge with and into Access, with
Access being the surviving company. As a result of the merger, Middleburg shareholders will receive Access common stock
in exchange for their Middleburg common stock. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

We currently expect to complete the merger during the second quarter of 2017. Following completion of the merger, it is
expected that Middleburg Bank, Middleburg’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, will merge with and into Access National
Bank, Access’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, also during the second quarter of 2017 (referred to sometimes as the
“subsidiary bank merger”).

 
 Q: What will Middleburg shareholders receive in the merger?
 

 

A: In the proposed merger, holders of Middleburg’s common stock will receive 1.3314 shares of common stock of Access for
each of their shares of Middleburg common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price
changes prior to the closing of the merger. Access shareholders will continue to own their existing shares, which will not be
affected by the merger.

 
 Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
 

 

A: Access and Middleburg are each holding a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete
the merger. We are sending you these materials to solicit your proxy and help you decide how to vote your shares of Access
common stock or Middleburg common stock at the special meetings. Access and Middleburg shareholders will be asked in
separate company proposals to approve the Access merger proposal and the Middleburg merger proposal, respectively.
Middleburg shareholders will also be asked to approve the compensation proposal.

 
 Q: What do I need to do now to vote my shares?
 

 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please vote your
shares as soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at the Access or Middleburg special meeting, as applicable.

proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

 
 Q: What if I do not vote on the merger proposals?
 

 

A: If you are an Access shareholder. With respect to the Access merger proposal, if you fail to vote or fail to instruct your
broker or other nominee how to vote, your failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against the Access merger
proposal. If you respond with an “abstain” vote, your proxy will have the same effect as a vote against the Access merger
proposal. If you are a shareholder of record of common stock and you sign and return your proxy card but do not indicate
how you want to vote on the Access merger proposal, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the proposal.

If you are a Middleburg shareholder. With respect to the Middleburg merger proposal, if you fail to vote or fail to instruct
your broker or other nominee how to vote, your failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against the Middleburg
merger proposal. If you respond with an “abstain” vote, your proxy will have the same effect as a vote against the
Middleburg merger proposal. If you are a shareholder of record of common stock and you sign and return your proxy card
but do not indicate how you want to vote on the Middleburg merger proposal, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor
of the proposal.

 Q: May I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy card or voting instructions?
 

 
A: Yes. If you are a shareholder of record of common stock, you may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted

at the applicable special meeting. You may do this in any of the following ways:
 

 
•  by sending a notice of revocation to either the Access corporate secretary or the Middleburg corporate secretary, as

the case may be;
 

 •  by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card;
 

 
•  by voting via the Internet or telephone any time after delivering your proxy card or voting instructions via the Internet

or telephone; or
 

 
•  by attending the Access or Middleburg special meeting and voting in person; your attendance alone will not revoke

any proxy.

If you choose either of the first two methods, your notice or new proxy card must be actually received before the voting
takes place at the applicable special meeting.

If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you should call your broker or other
nominee for additional information regarding how to change your vote.

 
 Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Middleburg shareholders?
 

 

A: The merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”). In connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this document forms a part,
Troutman Sanders LLP has delivered to Access, and Williams Mullen, a Professional Corporation (Richmond, Virginia)
(“Williams Mullen”) has delivered to Middleburg, their respective opinions that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
merger will qualify as a reorganization. Accordingly, a holder of Middleburg common stock generally will not recognize any
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange of the holder’s shares of Middleburg common
stock for shares of Access common stock pursuant to the merger, except with respect to any cash received instead of
fractional shares of Access common stock. For greater detail, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”
beginning on page 89. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your
particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences of the merger to you.

 
 Q: Do I have dissenters’ or appraisal rights?
 

 
A: No. Under Virginia law, shareholders of Access and Middleburg are not entitled to exercise dissenters’ or appraisal rights in

connection with the merger.

 
 

Q: If I am a Middleburg shareholder with shares represented by stock certificates, should I send in my Middleburg
stock certificates now?

 

 A: No. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

If you are a holder of Middleburg stock, you will receive written instructions from the exchange agent within five business
days after the merger is completed on how to exchange your Middleburg stock certificates for shares of Access common
stock issued on book-entry form or, if you elect, an Access stock certificate, and your check in lieu of any fractional shares
of Access common stock.

 
 Q: What should I do if I hold my shares of Middleburg common stock in book-entry form?
 

 
A: After the completion of the merger, Access will send you instructions on how to exchange your shares of Middleburg

common stock held in book-entry form for shares of Access common stock in book-entry form and receive your check in
lieu of fractional shares of Access common stock.

 
 

Q: What happens if I sell or transfer ownership of shares of Middleburg common stock after the record date for the
Middleburg special meeting?

special meeting, but the right to receive the merger consideration will transfer with the shares of Middleburg common stock.

 
 Q: Who should I contact if I have any questions about the proxy materials or voting?
 

 
A: If you have any questions about the merger or if you need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need

additional copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy card:

SUMMARY

This summary highlights selected information from this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read carefully the
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents to which this joint proxy statement/prospectus refers to understand fully
the merger and the other matters to be considered at the special meetings. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning
on page 108. Each item in this summary includes a page reference directing you to a more complete description of that item.

The Merger (page 45)

Access and Middleburg are proposing a combination of our companies through a merger of Middleburg with and into Access,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The parties expect to complete the merger during the second quarter
of 2017. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A. We encourage you to read the
merger agreement because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

If the merger is completed, it is expected that Middleburg Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Middleburg, will merge with
and into Access National Bank, the wholly-owned bank subsidiary of Access, following the merger with Access National Bank
being the surviving bank. The parties expect to complete the subsidiary bank merger during the second quarter of 2017.

Consideration to be Received in the Merger by Middleburg Shareholders (page 78)

In the proposed merger, holders of Middleburg common stock will receive 1.3314 shares of Access common stock for each of
their shares of Middleburg common stock outstanding on the effective date of the merger and cash in lieu of any fractional shares.
The number of shares of Access common stock delivered for each share of Middleburg common stock in the merger is referred to
as the “exchange ratio.” This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of
the merger. Based on the average closing price of Access’s common stock for the twenty trading days ended October 21, 2016
($24.42), the 1.3314 exchange ratio represented approximately $32.51 in value for each share of Middleburg common stock or
$233.1 million in the aggregate. Based on the average closing price of Access’s common stock for the twenty trading days ended
January 31, 2017, the last trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the 1.3314 exchange ratio
represented approximately $37.02 in value for each share of Middleburg common stock or $266.8 million in the aggregate. It is
expected that existing holders of Middleburg common stock will own approximately 47.3% of Access’s common stock after the
merger.

Shares of Access common stock held by Access shareholders will remain unchanged in the merger. It is expected that existing
holders of Access common stock will own approximately 52.7% of Access’s outstanding common stock after the merger.

Treatment of Middleburg Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards (page 79)

Stock Options. In the merger, each outstanding Middleburg stock option will be cancelled for a cash payment equal to the
product of (i) the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg common stock on the trading day immediately preceding
the effective date of the merger and the per share exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) the number of shares of Middleburg
common stock subject to such stock option.

Restricted Stock Awards. In the merger, all outstanding Middleburg restricted stock awards which are unvested or
contingent will, pursuant to the terms of each such award, vest in full immediately prior to the merger and be converted into
unrestricted shares of Access common stock based on the exchange ratio.

Dividend Information (page 92)

Access is currently paying a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its common stock at a rate of $0.15 per share. Access has no
current intention to change its dividend strategy of paying a quarterly cash dividend, but has and will continue to

evaluate that decision based on a quarterly review of earnings, growth, capital and such other factors that the Access board of
directors considers relevant to the dividend decision process. Middleburg currently pays a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its
common stock at a rate of $0.13 per share.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 89)

The merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In connection with the
filing of the registration statement of which this document forms a part, Troutman Sanders LLP has delivered to Access, and
Williams Mullen has delivered to Middleburg, their respective opinions (Exhibits 8.1 and 8.2, respectively) to that effect. Subject
to the limitations and qualifications described in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” (page 89), for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the merger generally will be tax-free to Middleburg shareholders as to the shares of Access common stock
they receive in the merger. However, Middleburg shareholders may recognize gain or loss in connection with cash received instead
of any fractional shares of Access common stock they would otherwise be entitled to receive. Additionally, it is a condition to
Middleburg’s and Access’s obligations to complete the merger that they each receive a legal opinion that the merger will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions,
however, will not bind the Internal Revenue Service, which could take a different view.

The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your own situation and the consequences described in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus may not apply to you. Middleburg shareholders will also be required to file certain information with
their federal income tax returns and to retain certain records with regard to the merger. In addition, you may be subject to state,
local or foreign tax laws and consequences that are not addressed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to consult
with your own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

For greater detail, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 89.

Access’s Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that Access Shareholders Vote “FOR” the Access Merger Proposal
and “FOR” the Access Adjournment Proposal (page 51)

Access’s board of directors has determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are in the best interests of Access and its shareholders and has approved the merger agreement. The Access
board of directors unanimously recommends that Access shareholders vote “FOR” the Access merger proposal and “FOR” the
Access adjournment proposal. In making its recommendations, a number of substantive reasons were considered by the Access
board, including, among others: (i) the expectation that the merger will create a $2.7 billion-asset bank ranked fifth in deposit
market-share among Virginia-based banks under $10 billion in assets; (ii) the belief that the merger will allow the combined
company to more effectively and efficiently navigate the challenges and costs associated with becoming a larger financial
institution; (iii) the expectation that the combined company will have increased resources to invest in future growth opportunities
in comparison to Access on a stand-alone basis; (iv) the complementary nature of Middleburg’s business, operations and
proficiencies with those of Access; and (v) the opportunities for greater efficiencies from conducting Access’s and Middleburg’s
operations as part of a single enterprise. For additional discussion of the factors considered by Access’s board of directors in
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, see “The Merger – Access’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of
Access’s Board of Directors.”

Middleburg’s Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that Middleburg Shareholders Vote “FOR” the Middleburg
Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Middleburg Adjournment Proposal (page 52)

Middleburg’s board of directors has determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement are in the best interests of Middleburg and its shareholders and has unanimously approved the merger
agreement. The Middleburg board of directors unanimously recommends that Middleburg shareholders vote “FOR” the

expectation that the merger will create a $2.7 billion-asset bank ranked fifth in deposit market-share among Virginia-based banks
under $10 billion in assets; (ii) Middleburg’s historical financial performance, prospects for the future, projected financial results
and alternatives for loan growth on a stand-alone basis, and the belief that the combined company will have increased resources
and ability to accelerate growth in comparison to Middleburg on a

stand-alone basis; (iii) the potential for Middleburg’s shareholders to benefit from the combined company’s expected profitability
and potential for growth and stock appreciation; (iv) the expected increase in cash dividend payments to be received by
Middleburg’s shareholders, as shareholders of Access following the merger; and (v) the belief that the combined company will be
able to more effectively and efficiently navigate the challenges of the current and prospective economic, regulatory and
competitive environments facing Middleburg and the financial services industry generally. For additional discussion of the factors
considered by Middleburg’s board of directors in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, see “The Merger –
 Middleburg’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Middleburg’s Board of Directors.”

Opinion of Access’s Financial Advisor (page 52)

In considering whether to approve the merger, Access’s board of directors considered the opinion of its financial advisor, FBR
Capital Markets & Co. (“FBR”), which delivered to Access’s board of directors its oral opinion on October 20, 2016, which was
subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of such date the exchange ratio was fair to Access from a financial point of view. A copy
of the FBR’s written fairness opinion, dated October 21, 2016, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix
B. You should read this opinion completely to understand the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken by FBR in providing its opinion. The opinion of FBR has not been updated prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and does not reflect any change in circumstances after October 21, 2016.

FBR’s opinion is directed to Access’s board of directors, addresses only the fairness of the exchange ratio pursuant to
the merger agreement from a financial point of view to Access, and does not address any other aspect of the merger. FBR’s
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Access shareholder as to how to vote or act with respect to the merger
or any matter considered at the Access special meeting.

Opinion of Middleburg’s Financial Advisor (page 58)

In connection with the merger, Middleburg’s board of directors received the opinion of Middleburg’s financial advisor,
Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (“Sandler O’Neill”), which delivered to Middleburg’s board of directors its oral opinion, which
was subsequently confirmed in writing on October 20, 2016, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio was fair to the
holders of Middleburg common stock from a financial point of view. A copy of the written opinion, dated October 20, 2016, is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix C. You should read this opinion completely to understand the
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review undertaken by Sandler O’Neill in providing its opinion. The
opinion of Sandler O’Neill has not been updated prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and does not reflect any
change in circumstances after October 20, 2016.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is directed to Middleburg’s board of directors, addresses only the fairness of the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement from a financial point of view to the holders of Middleburg common stock, and
does not address any other aspect of the merger. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
Middleburg shareholder as to how to vote or act with respect to the merger or any matter considered at the Middleburg
special meeting.

Regulatory Approvals (page 76)

Access and Middleburg cannot complete the merger without prior approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Virginia SCC”). Once the Federal
Reserve approves the merger, we have to wait from 15 to 30 days before we can complete it. During that time, the Department of
Justice may challenge the merger. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we have not yet received the required
regulatory approvals. While we do not know of any reason why we would not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals
in a timely manner, we cannot be certain when or if we will receive them or, if obtained, whether they will contain terms,
conditions or restrictions not currently contemplated that will be detrimental to the combined company after completion of the
merger.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 81)

Access’s and Middleburg’s respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the fulfillment or waiver of certain
conditions, including the following:
 

 
•  approval of the Access merger proposal and the Middleburg merger proposal by Access and Middleburg shareholders,

respectively;
 

 •  approval of the merger by the necessary federal and state regulatory authorities;
 

 •  the effectiveness of Access’s registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part;
 

 
•  approval from the NASDAQ Stock Market for the listing on the NASDAQ Global Market of the shares of common

stock of Access to be issued in the merger;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, decree or injunction of any court or regulatory agency that enjoins or prohibits the completion

of the merger;

•  the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the merger agreement, subject to the material adverse

effect standard in the merger agreement (subject to certain limited exceptions);
 

 •  the other party’s performance in all material respects of its obligations under the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the effectiveness of employment agreements with respect to the employment following the merger of Messrs. Shook,

Culver and Hartley by Access or certain of its subsidiaries, a general release for Messrs. Shook, Culver and Hartley, and
a separation agreement with respect to the termination of Mr. Mehra’s employment; and

 

 
•  the receipt by each party from its respective outside legal counsel of a written legal opinion to the effect that the merger

will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

In addition, Access’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to Middleburg having minimum tangible equity of $124.0
million and Middleburg’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to Access having minimum tangible equity of $120.5
million, in each case as of the last day of the month ended prior to the effective date of the merger. The merger agreement defines
each party’s tangible equity as total shareholders’ equity excluding intangible assets and other comprehensive income and, in the
case of Middleburg, excluding incremental losses to net book value related to certain specifically identified loans. Because Access
and Middleburg currently expect to complete the merger during the second quarter of 2017, the measurement of tangible equity for
these closing conditions is expected to include the impact of net income earned less dividends paid by Access and Middleburg,
respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. As a result, as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Access and Middleburg do not know of any reason why either of Access or Middleburg would not meet its
applicable minimum tangible equity closing condition in connection with the merger’s expected completion during the second
quarter of 2017. As of September 30, 2016, Access and Middleburg had tangible equity (measured as defined in the merger
agreement) of $118.1 million and $122.6 million, respectively.

Where the merger agreement and/or law permits, Access and Middleburg could choose to waive a condition to its obligation
to complete the merger even if that condition has not been satisfied. We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger
will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed.

Timing of the Merger (page 78)

Access and Middleburg expect to complete the merger after all conditions to the merger in the merger agreement are satisfied
or waived, including after shareholder approvals are received at the respective special meetings of Access and Middleburg and the
receipt of all required regulatory approvals. We currently expect to complete the merger during the second quarter of
2017. However, it is possible that factors outside of either party’s control could require us to complete the merger at a later time or
not to complete it at all.

Interests of Certain Middleburg Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 70)

Some of the directors and executive officers of Middleburg have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to,
their interests as shareholders of Middleburg. These interests exist because of, among other things, employment agreements that
the officers entered into with Middleburg, rights that these officers and directors have under Middleburg’s benefit plans including
equity plans (i.e., the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards), arrangements to continue as employees and directors of
Access, Access National Bank and certain of Access’s other subsidiaries following the merger (including potential arrangements),
and rights to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance following the merger. These interests include the
following, which have been calculated where applicable using assumptions set forth in “The Merger – Interests of Certain
Middleburg Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”, on page 70:
 

 

•  Change of control benefits to be paid by Access to Gary R. Shook, president and chief executive officer of Middleburg,
under his employment agreement with Middleburg when his employment agreement is terminated simultaneous with the
closing of the merger. The total value of the change of control benefits to which Mr. Shook is entitled under his
employment agreement is approximately $1,492,935, and the value associated with accelerated vesting of his unvested
restricted stock awards is approximately $1,113,427, assuming in both cases the merger was completed on January 15,
2017 (although such benefits will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of an excise tax under Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code).

•  Change of control benefits to be paid by Access to Jeffrey H. Culver, senior executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Middleburg, under his employment agreement with Middleburg when his employment agreement is terminated
simultaneous with the closing of the merger. The total value of the change of control benefits to which Mr. Culver is
entitled under his employment agreement is approximately $717,520, and the value associated with accelerated vesting
of his unvested restricted stock awards is approximately $908,362, assuming in both cases the merger was completed on
January 15, 2017 (although such benefits will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of an excise tax

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information combines the historical consolidated financial
position and results of operations of Access and Middleburg, as an acquisition by Access of Middleburg using the acquisition
method of accounting and giving effect to the related pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Middleburg will be recorded by Access at their respective fair values
as of the date the merger is completed. The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the Quarterly
Reports on Forms 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 and Annual Reports on Forms 10-K for the calendar year ended
December 31, 2015 of both Access and Middleburg, which are incorporated by reference herein. See “Selected Historical Financial
Data of Access” on page 15, “Selected Historical Financial Data of Middleburg” on page 17, “Information About Access National
Corporation” on page 94, “Information About Middleburg Financial Corporation” on page 95, and “Where You Can Find More
Information” on page 108.

The merger was announced on October 24, 2016. As a result of the merger, the holders of shares of Middleburg common stock will
receive 1.3314 shares of Access common stock for each share of Middleburg common stock held immediately prior to the effective
date of the merger. Each share of Access common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger will continue to be
outstanding after the merger. Each option to purchase shares of Middleburg common stock granted under a Middleburg equity-
based compensation plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will be cancelled for a cash
payment equal to the product of (i) the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg common stock on the trading day
immediately preceding the effective date of the merger and the per share exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) the number of
shares of Middleburg common stock subject to such stock option. Each restricted share of Middleburg common stock granted
under a Middleburg equity compensation plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will,
pursuant to the terms of each such grant, vest in full immediately prior to the effective date of the merger and be converted into
unrestricted shares of Access’s common stock based on the exchange ratio. The merger is intended to be treated as a
“reorganization” for federal income tax purposes; Access and Middleburg shareholders are not expected to recognize, for federal
income tax purposes, any gain or loss on the merger or the receipt of shares of Access common stock. For more information, see
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” on page 89.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if the transaction had occurred on
September 30, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 give effect to the merger as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2015.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included herein is presented for informational purposes only
and does not necessarily reflect the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the
beginning of the periods presented. The adjustments included in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information are preliminary and may be revised and may not agree to actual amounts recorded by Access upon consummation of
the merger. This financial information does not reflect the benefits of the expected cost savings and expense efficiencies,
opportunities to earn additional revenue, potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or asset dispositions, among
other factors, and includes various preliminary estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position or results
of operations that would have occurred if the merger had been consummated on the date or at the beginning of the period indicated
or which may be attained in the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in
conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes
thereto of Access and its subsidiaries, which are incorporated in this document by reference, and the historical consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto of Middleburg and its subsidiaries, which are also incorporated by reference.

NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On October 21, 2016, Access entered into the merger agreement with Middleburg. The merger agreement provides that at the
effective date of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Middleburg will be converted into the right to receive
1.3314 shares of Access common stock, par value $0.835 per share.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Access’ financial condition and results of operations,
including per share data, are presented after giving effect to the merger. The pro forma financial information assumes that the
merger with Middleburg was consummated on January 1, 2015 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statements of income and on September 30, 2016 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and
gives effect to the merger, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income, as if it had been
effective during the entire period presented.

The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the difference between the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed will be
recorded as goodwill.

The pro forma financial information includes estimated adjustments to record the assets and liabilities of Middleburg at their
respective fair values and represents management’s estimates based on available information. The pro forma adjustments included
herein may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analysis is performed. The final allocation of
the purchase price will be determined after the merger is completed and after completion of a final analysis to determine the fair
values of Middleburg’s tangible, and identifiable intangible, assets and liabilities as of the effective date of the merger.

In connection with the merger and the plan to integrate the operations of Access and Middleburg following the completion of the
merger, Access and Middleburg anticipate that nonrecurring charges, such as systems conversion costs, legal, investment banking
and accounting fees, fees paid to regulatory agencies, severance costs, and other merger-related costs will be incurred. Access also
anticipates that as a result of the integration following the completion of the merger, there will be certain cost savings resulting
from the integration of the operations of the banks. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of
income do not include the effects of the costs associated with any nonrecurring charges or integration activities resulting from the
merger, as they are nonrecurring in nature and not factually supportable at this time. In addition, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined consolidated financial information does not include any expected cost savings to be realized as a result of the
merger. However, these charges and savings will affect the statement of income of the surviving company following the completion
of the merger and in the period(s) in which they are recorded and/or realized. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
consolidated balance sheet does include a pro forma adjustment to reduce cash and shareholders’ equity to reflect the payment of
certain anticipated merger and integration costs, including amounts paid for systems conversion costs, legal, investment banking
and accounting fees, fees paid to regulatory agencies, severance costs, and other merger-related costs.

NOTE B – PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
All adjustments are based on current valuations, estimates, and assumptions. Subsequent to the completion of the merger, Access
will engage an independent third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
which could significantly change the amount of the estimated fair values used in the pro forma financial information presented.
 

(a) Adjustment reflects $2.5 million to be paid to Middleburg’s executive officers in connection with change in control
arrangements and $308 thousand to be paid to holders of in-the-money Middleburg stock options. Additionally, it is assumed
that cash and cash equivalents will be used to pay $2.6 million for after tax one-time merger expenses of Middleburg and $6.8
million for after tax one-time merger expenses of Access.

 

(b) Estimated fair value adjustment on securities held-to-maturity at current market pricing.
 

(c) A fair value adjustment was recorded to Middleburg’s outstanding loan portfolio. This fair value adjustment consists of an
adjustment to record the estimated fair value premium of $375 thousand to reflect differences in interest rates as well

as a fair value mark for credit deterioration of the acquired portfolio in the amount of $22.5 million which represented a mark
of 2.6% on Middleburg’s outstanding loan portfolio. Of the $22.5 million credit mark, approximately $11.9 million is
estimated to be an accretable adjustment. In order to determine the adjustment related to credit deterioration, Access engaged
an independent third party loan review team to review and perform analytics on Middleburg’s loan portfolio.

 

(d) Elimination of Middleburg’s allowance for loan losses. Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at
fair value and the recorded allowance of the acquired company is not carried over.

 

(e) Estimated fair value adjustment on premises, equipment and land acquired.
 

(f) Elimination of Middleburg’s goodwill ($3.4 million), addition of $11.6 million related to the core deposit intangible
(representing a 1.2% premium on Middleburg’s core deposits based on current market data for similar transactions) plus the
addition of goodwill generated as a result of the total purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired exceeding the fair
value of liabilities assumed ($96.4 million).

 

(g) Adjustment for deferred taxes associated with the adjustments to record the assets and liabilities of Middleburg at fair value
based on Access’ statutory rate of 35% as well as adjust for the conversion of Middleburg’s existing deferred tax asset from a
34% effective tax rate to Access’ 35% tax rate.

 

(h) Estimated fair value adjustment on deposits at current market rates and spreads for similar products.
 

(i) Estimated fair value adjustment on long-term borrowings at current market rates and spreads for similar products.
 

(j) Elimination of Middleburg’s shareholders’ equity representing conversion of all of Middleburg’s common shares into Access
common shares.

 

(k) Recognition of the equity portion of the merger consideration. The adjustment to common stock represents the $0.835 par
value of Access’ common stock issued to effect the transaction. The adjustment to surplus represents the amount of equity
consideration above the par value of Access’ common stock issued.

 

(l) Represents the net amortization and accretion on acquired loans assuming the merger closed on January 1, 2015 (see Note D).
 

(m) Represents net discount accretion on borrowings assumed as part of the merger assuming the merger closed on January 1,
2015 (see Note D). Discount on trust preferred capital notes will be accreted over nine years using the straight-line method.
Premium on other long-term borrowings will be amortized over four years using the straight-line method.

 

(n) Represents amortization of the fair value adjustment to premises and equipment assuming the merger closed on January 1,
2015 (see Note D).

 

(o) Represents amortization of core deposit premium assuming the merger closed on January 1, 2015 (see Note D). Premium will
be amortized over nine years using the sum-of-years digits method.

 

(p) Income tax expense calculated using a 35% tax rate.
 

(q) Weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding were adjusted to effect the transaction.
 

(r) Represents premium amortization on deposits assumed as part of the merger assuming the merger closed on January 1, 2015
(see Note D).

NOTE D – ESTIMATED AMORTIZATION/ACCRETION OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

The following table sets forth an estimate of the expected effects of the estimated aggregate acquisition accounting adjustments
reflected in the pro forma combined financial statements on the future pre-tax net income of Access after the merger with
Middleburg (unaudited, dollars in thousands):
 
   

Discount Accretion (Premium Amortization)
For the Years Ended December 31,  

   2017   2018   2019   2020   Thereafter  Total  
Loans   $ 4,945   $ 1,610   $ 1,265   $ 1,150   $ 2,530   $ 11,500  
Premises, equipment and land    133    133    133    133    4,796    5,328  
Deposits    (1,106)   —     —     —     —     (1,106) 
Borrowings    170    170    170    170    884    1,564  
Core deposit intangible    (2,312)   (2,055)   (1,798)   (1,541)   (3,852)   (11,558) 

The actual effect of acquisition accounting adjustments on the future pre-tax income of Access will differ from these estimates
based on the closing date estimates of fair values and the use of different amortization methods than assumed above.

NOTE E – ESTIMATED COST SAVINGS AND MERGER – RELATED COSTS

Estimated cost savings, expected to approximate 32% of Middleburg’s annualized pre-tax noninterest expenses, are excluded from
the pro forma analysis. Cost savings are estimated to be realized at 75% in the first year after acquisition and 100% in subsequent
years. In addition, estimated merger-related costs are not included in the pro forma combined statements of income since they will
be recorded in the combined results of income as they are incurred prior to or after completion of the merger and not indicative of
what historical results of the combined company would have been had the companies been actually combined during the periods
presented. Merger-related costs are estimated to be approximately $9.3 million, after-tax.

Table of Contents

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA UNAUDITED SHARE DATA

Summarized below is historical unaudited per share information for Access and Middleburg and additional information as if the
companies had been combined for the periods shown, which is referred to as “pro forma” information.

The Middleburg pro forma equivalent per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the Access pro forma combined book value
per share and net income per share by the exchange ratio of 1.3314 so that the per share amounts equate to the respective values for
one share of Middleburg common stock.

It is expected that both Access and Middleburg will incur merger and integration charges as a result of the merger. Also anticipated
is that the merger will provide the combined company with financial benefits that may include reduced operating expenses. The
information set forth below, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of
assumptions, may not reflect all of these anticipated financial expenses and does not reflect all of these anticipated financial
benefits or consider any potential impacts of current market conditions or the merger on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset
dispositions, and share repurchases, among other factors, and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It
also does not necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had the companies been
combined during the periods presented.

In addition, the information set forth below has been prepared based on preliminary estimates of merger consideration and fair
values attributable to the merger; the actual amounts recorded for the merger may differ from the information presented. The
estimation and allocations of merger consideration are subject to change pending further review of the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and actual transaction costs. A final determination of fair value will be based on the actual net
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Middleburg that will exist on the date of completion of the merger.

The information in the following table is based on, and should be read together with, the historical financial information and the
notes thereto for Access and Middleburg incorporated by reference into, or contained in, this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” on page 34, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in deciding how to vote on the proposals presented in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Certain risks can also be found in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by Access and Middleburg. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 108.

Because of the fixed exchange ratio and the fluctuation of the market price of Access common stock, shareholders of Access and
Middleburg will not know at the time of the special meetings the market value of the merger consideration to be paid by Access to
Middleburg shareholders.

In the merger, each share of Middleburg common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.3314 shares of Access
common stock, the value of which will depend upon the price of Access common stock at the effective date of the merger. The price of
Access common stock as of the effective date of the merger may vary from its price at the date the fixed exchange ratio was
established, at the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and at the date of the special meetings. Such variations in the price of
Access common stock may result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of Access, regulatory considerations, general
market and economic conditions, and other factors. At the time of the special meetings, shareholders of Access and Middleburg will
not know the exact value of the consideration to be paid by Access when the merger is completed. You should obtain current market
quotations for shares of Access common stock and for shares of Middleburg common stock.

The market price of Access common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of
Access or Middleburg currently.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of Middleburg common stock will become holders of Access common stock. Access’s
business differs in important respects from that of Middleburg, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company
and the market price of Access common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those
currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Access and Middleburg. For a discussion of the businesses of
Access and Middleburg and of certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the information described elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated herein by reference.

Combining Access and Middleburg may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than we expect.

The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Access’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from
combining the businesses of Access and Middleburg and to combine the businesses of Access and Middleburg in a manner that permits
growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of Middleburg or
Access or decreasing revenues due to loss of customers. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, Access must
successfully combine the businesses of Access and Middleburg. If Access is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated
benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

Access and Middleburg have operated, and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The
success of the merger will depend, in part, on Access’s ability to successfully combine the businesses of Access and Middleburg. To
realize these anticipated benefits, after the completion of the merger, Access expects to integrate Middleburg’s business into its own.
The integration process in the merger could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each party’s ongoing business,
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that affect adversely either party’s ability to maintain relationships with
customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Access’s
ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which Middleburg now operates, which could have an adverse effect on
Access’s financial results and the value of its common stock. If Access experiences difficulties with the integration process, the
anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized, fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger
of financial institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause Access and Middleburg to lose customers or cause customers to
withdraw their deposits from Middleburg’s or Access’s banking subsidiaries, or other unintended consequences that could have a
material

adverse effect on Access’s results of operations or financial condition after the merger. These integration matters could have an adverse
effect on each of Middleburg and Access during this transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the
merger.

If Access and Middleburg do not successfully integrate, the combined company may not realize the expected benefits from the
merger.

Integration in connection with a merger is sometimes difficult, and there is a risk that integrating Access and Middleburg may
take more time and resources than we expect. Access’s ability to integrate Middleburg and its future success depend in large part on the
ability of members of its board of directors and executive officers to work together effectively. After the merger, Access will be
governed by a board of directors comprised of 13 directors, of which seven are current directors of Access and the following six are
directors of Middleburg: John C. Lee, IV, Childs F. Burden, Gary D. LeClair, Mary Leigh McDaniel, Janet A. Neuharth, and Gary R.
Shook. One of the six such Middleburg directors, John C. Lee, IV, current chairman of Middleburg’s board of directors, will serve as
chairman of Access’s board of directors; Michael G. Anzilotti, the current chairman of Access’s board, will serve as vice chairman of
Access’s board; and the Executive Committee of the Access Board of Directors shall be Mr. Anzilotti, Martin S. Friedman, Michael W.
Clarke, Mr. Lee, IV, and Mr. Shook. The executive officers of Access will continue serving in their current positions as executive
officers of Access after the merger, and Mr. Shook and Jeffrey H. Culver will also serve as officers of Access after the merger as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Middleburg Investment Group and Chairman of Middleburg Trust Company, and as
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively. Disagreements among board members and executive management
could arise in connection with integration issues, strategic considerations and other matters. As a result, there is a risk that Access’s
board of directors and executive officers may not be able to operate effectively, which would affect adversely Access’s ability to
integrate the operations of Access and Middleburg successfully and Access’s future operating results.

Access may not be able to effectively integrate the operations of Middleburg Bank into Access National Bank.

The future operating performance of Access and Access National Bank will depend, in part, on the success of the merger of
Middleburg Bank and Access National Bank. After the merger of Access and Middleburg and at a time to be determined by Access,
Middleburg Bank will be merged with and into Access National Bank with Access National Bank surviving. After the merger of
Access and Middleburg, each director of Access, in addition to Mark Moore, President of Access National Bank, will serve as a
director of Access National Bank and as a director of Middleburg Bank, and executive officers of Access National Bank will continue
serving in their current positions as officers of Access National Bank. After the merger of Access and Middleburg, Mr. Shook and Mr.
Culver will also serve as officers of Access National Bank as President of Middleburg Bank, an operating division of Access National
Bank, and as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, and all executive officers of Access National Bank
will serve in substantially similar positions as officers of Middleburg Bank. The success of the merger of the banks will, in turn, depend
on a number of factors, including Access’s ability to: (i) integrate the operations and branches of Middleburg Bank and Access
National Bank; (ii) retain the deposits and customers of Middleburg Bank and Access National Bank; (iii) control the incremental
increase in noninterest expense arising from the merger in a manner that enables the combined bank to improve its overall operating
efficiencies; and (iv) retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of Middleburg Bank into the operations of Access National Bank, as
well as reducing overlapping bank personnel. The integration of Middleburg Bank and Access National Bank following the subsidiary
bank merger will require the dedication of the time and resources of the banks’ management and may temporarily distract
managements’ attention from the day-to-day business of the banks. If Access National Bank is unable to successfully integrate
Middleburg Bank, Access National Bank may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs.

Future results of the combined company may be materially different from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements included in this document because such financial statements do not reflect actual merger-related
expenses and restructuring charges.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus only show a
combination of Access’s and Middleburg’s historical results, and they do not necessarily indicate the future financial condition or
operating results of the combined company. Access estimates that the combined company will record an aggregate of approximately
$6.8 million, net of income tax effect, in merger-related expenses and restructuring charges. The actual charges may be higher or lower
than estimated, depending upon how costly or difficult it is to integrate the two companies. These charges will decrease the capital of
the combined company available for future profitable, income-earning investments.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently
anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation following the merger.

Before the merger of Middleburg into Access, or the merger of Middleburg Bank into Access National Bank, may be completed,
Access and Middleburg must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve, the Virginia SCC and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (the “OCC”). Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant
these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party, the competitive effects of
the contemplated transactions, and the factors described under “The Merger –Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger.” An
adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or these factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their
receipt. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder (which we refer to as the
“CRA”) also requires that the bank regulatory authorities, in deciding whether to approve the merger and the bank merger, assess the
records of performance of Access National Bank and Middleburg Bank in meeting the credit needs of the communities they serve,
including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Each of Access National Bank and Middleburg Bank currently maintains a CRA
rating of “Satisfactory” from its primary regulator. As part of the review process under the CRA, it is not unusual for the bank
regulatory authorities to receive protests and other adverse comments from community groups and others. Any such protests or adverse
comments could prolong the period during which the merger and the bank merger are subject to review by the bank regulatory
authorities.

These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or the bank merger or require changes to the terms of
the merger or the bank merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or
the bank merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the surviving corporation following the merger and the
bank merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation following the merger. See “The Merger –
 Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger.”

The merger may distract management of Access and Middleburg from their other responsibilities.

The merger could cause the respective management groups of Access and Middleburg to focus their time and energies on matters
related to the transaction that otherwise would be directed to their business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of either
company’s management could affect its ability to service existing business and develop new business and adversely affect the business
and earnings of Access or Middleburg before the merger, or the business and earnings of Access after the merger.

Termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact Access or Middleburg.

If the merger agreement is terminated, Access’s or Middleburg’s business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue
other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of
completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of Access’s or Middleburg’s common
stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.
Furthermore, costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the merger is not
completed. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving a change in
recommendation by Access’s or Middleburg’s board of directors, Access or Middleburg may be required to pay to the other party a
termination fee of $9.9 million. See “The Merger Agreement –Termination Fee” on page 86.

Neither of the fairness opinions received by the respective boards of directors of Access and Middleburg in connection with the
merger prior to the signing of the merger agreement has been updated to reflect changes in circumstances since the signing of the
merger agreement.

The opinions rendered by FBR Capital Markets & Co., financial advisor to Access, orally on October 20, 2016 and subsequently
confirmed in writing on October 21, 2016, and by Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P., financial advisor to Middleburg, on October 20,
2016, are based upon information available as of such date. Neither opinion has been updated to reflect changes that may occur or may
have occurred after the date on which it was delivered, including changes to the operations and prospects of Access or Middleburg,
changes in general market and economic conditions, or other changes. Any such changes may alter the relative value of Access or
Middleburg or the prices of shares of Access common stock or Middleburg common stock by the time the merger is completed. The
opinions do not speak as of the date the merger will be

completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. For a description of the opinion that Access received from its financial
advisor, please see “The Merger – Opinion of Access’s Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 52. For a description of the opinion that
Middleburg received from its financial advisor, please see “The Merger – Opinion of Middleburg’s Financial Advisor,” beginning on
page 58.

Certain of Middleburg’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from the interests of Middleburg’s
other shareholders.

Middleburg’s shareholders should be aware that some of Middleburg’s directors and executive officers have interests in the
merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of Middleburg’s shareholders generally. The Middleburg
board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making its decision to
approve the merger agreement and the plan of merger, and in recommending that Middleburg’s shareholders vote in favor of approving
the Middleburg merger proposal. These interests include the following: (i) employment agreements with respect to employment with
Access and certain of its subsidiaries after the merger of each of Messrs. Shook, Culver and Hartley, and the termination of current
employment agreements and payment of benefits thereunder for Messrs. Shook, Culver, Hartley and Mehra; (ii) the treatment of
outstanding Middleburg stock options and restricted stock awards pursuant to the merger agreement and the terms of such instruments;
(iii) that following the merger six directors (Messrs. Lee, IV, Burden, LeClair and Shook and Mmes. McDaniel and Neuharth) will
serve as directors of Access, Access National Bank and, until merged with Access National Bank, Middleburg Bank; and (iv) rights to
ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage by Access following the merger for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger.
For a more complete description of these interests, see “The Merger – Interests of Certain Middleburg Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger.”

The merger agreement limits the ability of Access and Middleburg to pursue alternatives to the merger and might discourage
competing offers for a higher price or premium.

The merger agreement contains “no-shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, limit the ability of Access and
Middleburg to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of each company. In
addition, under certain circumstances, if the merger agreement is terminated and either Access or Middleburg, subject to certain
restrictions, consummates a similar transaction other than the merger, the party consummating such transaction must pay to the other a
termination fee of $9.9 million. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in
acquiring all or a significant percentage of ownership of Access or Middleburg from considering or proposing the acquisition even if it
were prepared to pay consideration, with respect to Middleburg, with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the merger,
and with respect to Access, with a per share market price that would amount to a premium over the current per share market price of
Access. See “The Merger Agreement – Termination Fee” on page 86.

Access and Middleburg will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Access and Middleburg.
These uncertainties may impair Access’s and Middleburg’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is
completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Access and Middleburg to seek to change existing business
relationships with Access and Middleburg. Retention of certain employees by Access and Middleburg may be challenging while the
merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Access or Middleburg. If key
employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Access or
Middleburg, Access’s or Middleburg’s business, or the business of the combined company following the merger, could be harmed. In
addition, subject to certain exceptions, Access and Middleburg have each agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to
closing and refrain from taking certain specified actions until the merger occurs, which may prevent Access or Middleburg from
pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the merger. See “The Merger Agreement – Business
Pending the Merger” on page 82 for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Access and Middleburg.

If the merger is not completed, Access and Middleburg will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected
benefits of the merger.

Each of Access and Middleburg has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and
completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing

and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the merger. If the
merger is not completed, Access and Middleburg would have to incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the
merger.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document are preliminary and the actual
financial condition and results of operations of Access after the merger may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this document are presented for illustrative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of what Access’s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger
been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments to
illustrate the effect of the merger had it been completed on the dates indicated, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record
the Middleburg identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase
price allocation for the merger reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon
the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Middleburg as of the date of the completion of the merger.
Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this
document. For more information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

Current holders of Access and Middleburg common stock will have less influence as holders of Access common stock after the
merger.

It is expected that the current holders of Access common stock will own approximately 52.7% of the outstanding common stock
of Access after the merger. As a group, the current holders of common stock of Middleburg will own approximately 47.3% of the
outstanding common stock of Access after the merger. Each current holder of Access and Middleburg common stock will own a
smaller percentage of Access after the merger than they currently own of Access or Middleburg, respectively. As a result of the merger,
holders of Access and Middleburg common stock will have less influence on the management and policies of Access than they
currently have on the management and policies of Access or Middleburg, respectively.

Access is not obligated to pay cash dividends on its common stock.

Access is a bank holding company and, currently, its primary source of funds for paying dividends to its shareholders is dividends
it receives from Access National Bank. Access is currently paying a quarterly cash dividend to holders of its common stock at a rate of
$0.15 per share. However, Access is not obligated to pay dividends in any particular amounts or at any particular times. Its decision to
pay dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors, including its capital and the availability of funds from which dividends
may be paid. See “Market for Common Stock and Dividends” on page 92 and “Description of Access Capital Stock” on page 96.

The shares of Access common stock to be received by Middleburg shareholders as a result of the merger will have different rights
than shares of Middleburg common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, Middleburg shareholders will become Access shareholders and their rights as shareholders will
be governed by Virginia law and the Access articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights associated with Middleburg common stock
are different from the rights associated with Access common stock. See “Comparative Rights of Shareholders” beginning on page 98
for a discussion of the different rights associated with Access common stock.

After the merger a limited number of shareholders will collectively own a substantial percentage of the Access common stock and
could significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval.

Access’s present officers and directors beneficially own approximately 24.8% of Access common stock as of January 15, 2017,
and after giving effect to the merger’s exchange ratio, based on shares of Access common stock and Middleburg common stock
outstanding as of January 31, 2017, are expected to beneficially own 13.1% of Access common stock following the merger. In addition,
David L. Sokol beneficially owns approximately 29.2% of Middleburg common stock as of January 31, 2017, and after giving effect to
the merger’s exchange ratio, based on shares of Access common stock and Middleburg common stock outstanding as of January 31,
2017, is expected to beneficially own 13.8% of Access common stock following the merger.

Table of Contents

Based on their share ownership, these shareholders may be able to exercise significant influence over certain matters requiring
shareholder approval. Those matters include approval of significant corporate transactions (including mergers), which may require the
approval of more than two thirds of the shares of Access common stock entitled to vote on the transaction, the election of directors or
the amendment of Access’s articles of incorporation. This influence could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control
of Access following the merger or changes in management, may make the approval of certain transactions difficult without the support
of these significant shareholders, and may result in corporate actions or inaction with which you do not agree.

Middleburg shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to shareholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. The Virginia SCA
provides that appraisal rights are not available to holders of common or preferred stock of a Virginia corporation in a merger when the
stock is either listed on a national securities exchange, such as the NASDAQ Global Market, or is held by at least 2,000 shareholders of
record. The stock of each of Access and Middleburg is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Therefore, Middleburg shareholders are
not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Access may need additional access to capital, which Access may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.

Access may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments for future
growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Access’s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will
depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of Access’s control, and on Access’s financial
performance. Accordingly, Access may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If
Access cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions
could be materially impaired and its stock price negatively affected.

Access may borrow funds or issue additional debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which
may be senior to Access common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of Access
common stock.

In the future, Access may attempt to increase its capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or
secured by all or up to all of Access’s assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of
secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock, common stock, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of Access’s liquidation, its lenders and holders of its debt
and preferred securities would receive a distribution of its available assets before distributions to the holders of Access common stock.
Because Access’s decision to incur debt and issue securities in its future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors
beyond Access’s control, Access cannot predict or estimate with certainty the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings and debt
financings. Further, market conditions could require Access to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of its securities in the future.
In addition, the borrowing of funds or the issuance of debt would increase Access’s leverage and decrease its liquidity, and the issuance
of additional equity securities would dilute the interests of Access’s existing shareholders.

Sales of a significant number of shares of Access common stock in the public markets, or the perception of such sales, could
depress the market price of Access common stock.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of Access common stock in the public markets, including shares issued to shareholders of
acquired institutions, and the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of Access common stock. In
addition, future issuances of equity securities, including pursuant to outstanding options, could dilute the interests of Access’s existing
shareholders and could cause the market price of Access common stock to decline. Access may issue such additional equity or
convertible securities to raise additional capital. Depending on the amount offered and the levels at which Access offers the stock,
issuances of common or preferred stock could be substantially dilutive to holders of Access common stock. Moreover, to the extent
that Access issues restricted stock, options or warrants to purchase Access common stock in the future and those options or warrants
are exercised or as shares of the restricted stock vest, Access shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of Access
common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro-rata share of any offering of shares of any class or
series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to Access shareholders. Access cannot predict with
certainty the effect that future sales of Access common stock would have on the market price of its common stock.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements to encourage
companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed
in the statement. Access and Middleburg desire to take advantage of these “safe harbor” provisions with regard to the forward-looking
statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents that are incorporated herein by reference. These forward-
looking statements reflect the current views of Access and Middleburg with respect to future events and financial performance.
Specifically, forward-looking statements may include:
 

 
•  statements relating to the ability of Access and Middleburg to timely complete the merger and the benefits thereof, including

anticipated efficiencies, opportunities, synergies and cost savings estimated to result from the merger;
 

 
•  projections of revenues, expenses, income, income per share, net interest margins, asset growth, loan production, asset

quality, deposit growth and other performance measures, including the information set forth under the heading “Certain
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 69;

 

 
•  statements regarding expansion of operations, including branch openings, entrance into new markets, development of

products and services, and execution of strategic initiatives;
 

 
•  discussions of the future state of the economy, competition, regulation, taxation, our business strategies, subsidiaries,

investment risk and policies; and
 

 
•  statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,”

“anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “prospects,” “may,” “could,” “will” or similar expressions.

These forward-looking statements express the best judgment of Access and Middleburg based on currently available information
and we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable.

By their nature, however, forward-looking statements often involve assumptions about the future. Such assumptions are subject to
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. As
such, Access and Middleburg cannot guarantee you that the expectations reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements
actually will be achieved. Actual results may differ materially from those reflected in or implied by the forward-looking statements due
to, among other things, the following factors:
 

 
•  the businesses of Access and Middleburg may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-

consuming or costly than expected;
 

 
•  expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected

timeframe;
 

 •  revenues following the merger may be lower than expected;
 

 •  customer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger;
 

 
•  the ability to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals, and the ability to complete the merger within the

expected timeframe, may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected;
 

 •  changes in general business, economic and market conditions;
 

 •  changes in fiscal and monetary policies, and laws and regulations;
 

 •  changes in interest rates, deposit flows, loan demand and real estate values;
 

 •  a deterioration in credit quality and/or a reduced demand for, or supply of, credit;
 

 •  volatility in the securities markets generally or in the market price of Access’s stock specifically; and

THE ACCESS SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Place and Time

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed on or about February 8, 2017 to Access shareholders who held shares
of Access common stock, par value $0.835 per share, on the record date for the Access special meeting of shareholders. This joint
proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by the notice of the special meeting and a form of proxy that is solicited by the Access
board of directors for use at the special meeting to be held on Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 9:30 a.m. local time, at Access’s office,
located at 1800 Robert Fulton Drive, Reston, Virginia 20191, and at any adjournments of that meeting.

Purposes of the Access Special Meeting

At the special meeting, the shareholders of Access will be asked:
 

 •  to approve the Access merger proposal as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and
 

 •  to approve the Access adjournment proposal as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendation of the Access Board of Directors

The Access board of directors believes that the proposed merger with Middleburg is fair to and is in the best interests of Access
and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Access shareholders vote “FOR” each of the proposals that will be presented at
the Access special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Record Date and Voting Rights; Quorum

The Access board of directors has fixed the close of business on January 31, 2017 as the record date for determining the
shareholders of Access entitled to notice of and to vote at the Access special meeting or any adjournments thereof. Accordingly, you
are only entitled to notice of and to vote at the Access special meeting if you were a record holder of Access common stock at the close
of business on the record date. At that date, 10,695,300 shares of Access common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote.

To have a quorum that permits Access to conduct business at the Access special meeting, the presence, whether in person or by
proxy, of the holders of Access’s common stock representing a majority of the voting shares outstanding on the record date is required.
You are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of Access common stock you held as of the close of business on the record date.

Holders of shares of Access common stock present in person at the special meeting but not voting, and shares of Access common
stock for which proxy cards are received indicating that their holders have abstained, will be counted as present at the special meeting
for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum for transacting business. Shares held in “street name” that have been designated
by brokers on proxies as not voted will not be counted as votes cast for or against any proposal and will not be counted for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum unless the broker has been instructed to vote on at least one of the proposals for the Access
special meeting.

Votes Required

Vote Required for Approval of the Access Merger Proposal. The approval of the Access merger proposal requires the vote of
more than two-thirds of the shares of Access common stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on the proposal. Because, however, approval of the
Access merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of the shares of Access common stock outstanding on the
record date for the special meeting, failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same vote as votes against the
Access merger proposal.

Vote Required for Approval of the Access Adjournment Proposal. The approval of the Access adjournment proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Access common stock voted on the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect for purposes of determining
whether the Access adjournment proposal has been approved.

Table of Contents

Stock Ownership of Access Executive Officers and Directors

Each director and executive officer of Access has entered into an agreement with Access and Middleburg pursuant to which he or
she has agreed to vote all of his or her shares in favor of the Access merger proposal, subject to certain exceptions, including that
certain shares they hold in a fiduciary capacity or for which they do not have sole voting or dispositive power are not covered by the
agreement. As of the record date, directors and executive officers of Access and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote
approximately 2,563,755 shares of Access common stock at the Access special meeting, or approximately 24.0% of the total voting
power of shares of Access common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, of which 1,091,309 shares or 10.2% of the total voting
power of the shares of Access common stock outstanding on that date are subject to an affiliate agreement.

Voting at the Access Special Meeting

Record Holders. If your shares of Access common stock are held of record in your name, your shares can be voted at the Access
special meeting in any of the following ways:
 

 

•  By Mail. You can vote your shares by using the proxy card that is enclosed for your use in connection with the special
meeting. If you complete and sign the proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope, you will be appointing
the “proxies” named in the proxy card to vote your shares for you at the special meeting. The authority you will be giving
the proxies is described in the proxy card. When your proxy card is returned properly executed, the shares of Access
common stock represented by it will be voted at the Access special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in
the proxy card.

 

 
•  If proxy cards are returned properly executed without an indication as to how the proxies should vote, the Access common

stock represented by each such proxy card will be considered to be voted (i) “FOR” the Access merger proposal and (ii)
“FOR” the Access adjournment proposal.

 

 

•  By the Internet or Telephone. You can appoint the proxies to vote your shares for you by going to the Internet website
(www.investorvote.com/ANCX) or by calling 800-652-Vote (8683). When you are prompted for your “control number,”
enter the number printed just above your name on the enclosed proxy card, and then follow the instructions provided. You
may vote by Internet or telephone only until 12:01 a.m. local time on March 15, 2017, which is the day of the Access special
meeting. If you vote by the Internet or telephone, you need not sign and return a proxy card. Under Virginia law, you will be
appointing the proxies to vote your shares on the same terms as are described above and with the same authority as if you
completed, signed and returned a proxy card. The authority you will be giving the proxies is described in the proxy card.

 

 
•  In Person. You can attend the Access special meeting and vote in person. A ballot will be provided for your use at the

meeting.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card, or follow the instructions above
to vote by the Internet or telephone, whether or not you plan to attend the Access special meeting in person.

Shares Held in “Street Name.” Only the record holders of shares of Access common stock, or their appointed proxies, may vote
those shares. As a result, if your shares of Access common stock are held for you in “street name” by a broker or other nominee, such
as a bank or custodian, then only your broker or nominee (i.e., the record holder) may vote them for you, or appoint the proxies to vote
them for you, unless you previously have made arrangements for your broker or nominee to assign its voting rights to you or for you to
be recognized as the person entitled to vote your shares. You will need to follow the directions your broker or nominee provides you
and give it instructions as to how it should vote your shares by following the instructions you received from your broker or nominee
with your copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers and other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for their clients
typically have the discretionary authority to vote those shares on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from
beneficial owners of the shares. However, they may not vote those shares on “non-routine” matters, such as the proposals that will be
presented at the Access special meeting, unless their clients give them voting instructions. To ensure that your shares are represented at
the Access special meeting and voted in the manner you desire, it is important that you instruct your broker or nominee as to how it
should vote your shares.

If your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote them in person at the Access special meeting, you must obtain a
proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record.

you gave the proxies, you can do so at any time before the voting takes place at the Access special meeting by taking the appropriate
action described below.

To change the voting instructions you gave the proxies:
 

 
•  you can complete, sign and submit a new proxy card, dated after the date of your original proxy card, which contains your

new instructions, and submit it so that it is received before the special meeting or, if hand delivered, before the voting takes
place at the Access special meeting; or

 

 

•  if you appointed the proxies by the Internet or telephone, you can go to the same Internet website
(www.investorvote.com/ANCX), or use the same telephone number (800-652-Vote (8683)) before 12:01 a.m. local time on
March 15, 2017 (the day of the special meeting), enter the same control number (printed just above your name on the
enclosed proxy card) that you previously used to appoint the proxies, and then change your voting instructions.

The proxies will follow the last voting instructions received from you before the Access special meeting.

To revoke your proxy card or your appointment of the proxies by Internet or telephone:
 

 
•  you can give Access’s Corporate Secretary a written notice, before the Access special meeting or, if hand delivered, before

the voting takes place at the Access special meeting, that you want to revoke your proxy card or Internet or telephone
appointment; or

 

 

•  you can attend the Access special meeting and vote in person or notify Access’s Corporate Secretary, before the voting takes
place, that you want to revoke your proxy card or Internet or telephone appointment. Simply attending the special meeting
alone, without voting in person or notifying Access’s Corporate Secretary, will not revoke your proxy card or Internet or
telephone appointment.

If you submit your new proxy card or notice of revocation by mail, it should be addressed to Access’s Corporate Secretary at
Access National Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 1800 Robert Fulton Drive, Suite 300, Reston, Virginia 20191, and must
be received no later than the beginning of the Access special meeting or, if the special meeting is adjourned, before the adjourned
meeting is actually held. If hand delivered, your new proxy card or notice of revocation must be received by Access’s Corporate
Secretary before the voting takes place at the special meeting or at any adjourned meeting.

If you need assistance in changing or revoking your proxy, please contact:
 

 
•  Access’s Corporate Secretary by calling (703) 871-2100 or by writing to Access National Corporation, 1800 Robert Fulton

Drive, Suite 300, Reston, Virginia 20191, Attention: Corporate Secretary; or
 

 
•  Regan & Associates, Inc. by calling (800) 737-3246 or by writing to Regan & Associates, 505 Eighth Avenue –Suite 800,

New York, New York 10018, Attention: Artie Regan.

Shares Held in “Street Name.” If your shares are held in “street name” and you want to change or revoke voting instructions you
have given to the record holder of your shares, you must follow the directions given by your bank, broker, custodian or nominee.

Participants in the Access 401(k) Plan

If you hold shares in the Access 401(k) Plan through a self-directed brokerage account, you should refer to the voting instructions
provided by your broker for information on how to direct the voting of such shares to allow sufficient time for voting by the trustee of
the plan.

Solicitation of Proxies

This solicitation is made on behalf of the Access board of directors, and Access will pay the costs of soliciting and obtaining
proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to shareholders. Proxies may be solicited,
without extra compensation, by Access’s officers and employees by mail, electronic mail, telephone, fax or personal interviews. Access
has currently engaged Regan & Associates, Inc. to assist it in the distribution and solicitation of proxies for a fee of $22,500, plus out-
of-pocket expenses. Access will also reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in sending
these materials to you and getting your voting instructions.

PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE ACCESS SPECIAL MEETING

Approval of the Access Merger Proposal (Access Proposal No. 1)

At the Access special meeting, shareholders of Access will be asked to approve the Access merger proposal providing for the
merger of Middleburg with and into Access. Shareholders of Access should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in
its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the
merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

After careful consideration, the Access board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger to be advisable and in
the best interests of Access and the shareholders of Access. See “The Merger – Access’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of
Access’s Board of Directors” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the Access
board of directors’ recommendation.

The Access board of directors unanimously recommends that Access shareholders vote “FOR” the Access merger
proposal.

Approval of the Access Adjournment Proposal (Access Proposal No. 2)

If at the Access special meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve the Access merger proposal, the meeting may be
adjourned to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies to approve the Access merger
proposal. In that event, Access shareholders will be asked to vote on the Access adjournment proposal and will not be asked to vote on
the Access merger proposal.

In order to allow proxies that have been received by Access at the time of the Access special meeting to be voted for the Access
adjournment proposal, Access is submitting the Access adjournment proposal to its shareholders as a separate matter for their
consideration. This proposal asks Access shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Access board of directors
on a discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the Access special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from Access shareholders who have previously voted.

If it is necessary to adjourn the Access special meeting, then, unless the meeting will have been adjourned for a total of more than
120 days, no notice of the date, time, place or purpose of such adjourned meeting is required to be given to shareholders, other than an
announcement at the Access special meeting, prior to such adjournment. Even if a quorum is not present, shareholders who are
represented at a meeting may approve an adjournment of the meeting.

The Access board of directors unanimously recommends that Access shareholders vote “FOR” the Access adjournment
proposal.

THE MIDDLEBURG SPECIAL MEETING

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed on or about February 8, 2017 to Middleburg shareholders who held
shares of Middleburg common stock, par value $2.50 per share, on the record date for the Middleburg special meeting of shareholders.
This joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by the notice of the special meeting and a form of proxy that is solicited by the
Middleburg board of directors for use at the special meeting to be held on Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. local time, at the
Middleburg Community Center, located at 300 West Washington Street, Middleburg, Virginia 20117, and at any adjournments of that
meeting.

Purposes of the Middleburg Special Meeting

At the special meeting, the shareholders of Middleburg will be asked:
 

 •  to approve the Middleburg merger proposal as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus;
 

 
•  to approve, on an advisory basis only, the compensation proposal as more fully described in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus; and
 

 •  to approve the Middleburg adjournment proposal as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendation of the Middleburg Board of Directors

The Middleburg board of directors believes that the proposed merger with Access is fair to and is in the best interests of
Middleburg and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Middleburg shareholders vote “FOR” each of the proposals that
will be presented at the Middleburg special meeting as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Record Date and Voting Rights; Quorum

The Middleburg board of directors has fixed the close of business on January 31, 2017 as the record date for determining the
shareholders of Middleburg entitled to notice of and to vote at the Middleburg special meeting or any adjournments thereof.
Accordingly, you are only entitled to notice of and to vote at the Middleburg special meeting if you were a record holder of Middleburg
common stock at the close of business on the record date. At that date, 7,205,066 shares of Middleburg common stock were
outstanding and entitled to vote.

To have a quorum that permits Middleburg to conduct business at the Middleburg special meeting, we require the presence,
whether in person or by proxy, of the holders of Middleburg’s common stock representing a majority of the voting shares outstanding
on the record date. You are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of Middleburg common stock you held as of the close of
business on the record date.

Holders of shares of Middleburg common stock present in person at the special meeting but not voting, and shares of Middleburg
common stock for which proxy cards are received indicating that their holders have abstained, will be counted as present at the special
meeting for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum for transacting business. Shares held in “street name” that have been
designated by brokers on proxies as not voted will not be counted as votes cast for or against any proposal and will not be counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum unless the broker has been instructed to vote on at least one of the proposals for the
Middleburg special meeting.

Votes Required

Vote Required for Approval of the Middleburg Merger Proposal. The approval of the Middleburg merger proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Middleburg common stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast. Because, however, approval of the Middleburg
merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of Middleburg common stock outstanding on the
record date, failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the Middleburg merger
proposal.

only, of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Middleburg common stock voted on the
proposal.

proposal.

Vote Required for Approval of the Middleburg Adjournment Proposal. The approval of the Middleburg adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Middleburg common stock voted on the proposal, whether or not a quorum
is present.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect for purposes of determining

Each director and executive officer of Middleburg has entered into an agreement with Access and Middleburg pursuant to which
he or she has agreed to vote all of his or her shares in favor of the Middleburg merger proposal, subject to certain exceptions, including
that certain shares they hold in a fiduciary capacity or for which they do not have sole voting or dispositive power are not covered by
the agreement. As of the record date, directors and executive officers of Middleburg and their affiliates beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote approximately 378,704 shares of Middleburg common stock at the Middleburg special meeting, or approximately 5.3%
of the total voting power of the shares of Middleburg common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, of which 357,420 shares or
5.0% of the total voting power of the shares of Middleburg common stock outstanding on that date are subject to an affiliate agreement.

Stock Ownership of Certain Middleburg Shareholders

David L. Sokol, Middleburg’s largest shareholder, and a trust of which Mr. Sokol is the sole trustee, entered into a voting and
standstill agreement with Middleburg and Access pursuant to which Mr. Sokol and the trust have agreed to vote all shares of
Middleburg common stock beneficially owned by them, among other things, in favor of the merger and against any competing
acquisition proposal. As of the record date, Mr. Sokol and the trust owned and are entitled to vote 2,103,008 shares of Middleburg
common stock, or approximately 29.2% of the total voting power of the shares of Middleburg common stock outstanding on that date,
and all such shares of Middleburg common stock are subject to the voting and standstill agreement. For additional discussion of the
voting and standstill agreement, see “The Merger Agreement – The Voting and Standstill Agreement.”

PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE MIDDLEBURG SPECIAL MEETING

Approval of the Middleburg Merger Proposal (Middleburg Proposal No. 1)

At the special meeting, shareholders of Middleburg will be asked to approve the Middleburg merger proposal providing for the
merger of Middleburg with and into Access. Shareholders of Middleburg should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully
and in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of
the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

After careful consideration, the Middleburg board of directors, by a unanimous vote of all directors, approved the merger
agreement and the merger to be advisable and in the best interests of Middleburg and the shareholders of Middleburg. See “The
Merger – Middleburg’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Middleburg’s Board of Directors” included elsewhere in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the Middleburg board of directors’ recommendation.

The Middleburg board of directors unanimously recommends that Middleburg shareholders vote “FOR” the Middleburg
merger proposal.

Approval of the Compensation Proposal (Middleburg Proposal No. 2)

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Middleburg is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to approve, in a
non-binding advisory vote, the compensation proposal, by voting on the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid to the named executive officers of Middleburg in connection with or as a
result of the merger, as disclosed in the sections entitled “The Merger – Interests of Certain Middleburg Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger – Employment and Change of Control Agreements for Middleburg Named Executive Officers” and “– Payments
and Benefits to Middleburg Named Executive Officers” and the related table and narrative, is hereby APPROVED.”

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart
from the vote on the Middleburg merger proposal. Because the compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, a vote for or against
approval will not be binding on either Middleburg or Access.

The compensation that is subject to this proposal is a contractual obligation of Middleburg and/or Middleburg Bank, or of Access
and/or Access National Bank including as the successors to Middleburg and Middleburg Bank, respectively. If the merger is approved
and completed, such compensation may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, even if shareholders fail to approve
this proposal. If the merger is not completed, the Middleburg board of directors will consider the results of the vote in making future
executive compensation decisions.

The Middleburg board of directors unanimously recommends that Middleburg shareholders vote “FOR” the
compensation proposal.

Approval of the Middleburg Adjournment Proposal (Middleburg Proposal No. 3)

If at the Middleburg special meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve the Middleburg merger proposal, the meeting may
be adjourned to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of proxies to approve the Middleburg
merger proposal. In that event, Middleburg shareholders will be asked to vote on the Middleburg adjournment proposal, may be asked
to vote on the compensation proposal and will not be asked to vote on the Middleburg merger proposal at the Middleburg special
meeting.

In order to allow proxies that have been received by Middleburg at the time of the Middleburg special meeting to be voted for the
Middleburg adjournment proposal, Middleburg is submitting the Middleburg adjournment proposal to its shareholders as a separate
matter for their consideration. This proposal asks Middleburg shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the
Middleburg board of directors on a discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the Middleburg special meeting to another time
and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from Middleburg shareholders who have
previously voted.

If it is necessary to adjourn the Middleburg special meeting, then no notice of such adjourned meeting is required to be given to
shareholders, other than an announcement at the special meeting before adjournment of the place, date and time to which the
Middleburg special meeting is adjourned. Even if a quorum is not present, shareholders who are represented at a meeting may approve
an adjournment of the meeting.

The Middleburg board of directors unanimously recommends that Middleburg shareholders vote “FOR” the Middleburg
adjournment proposal.

THE MERGER

The following discussion contains certain information about the merger. The discussion is subject to and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated
herein by reference. We urge you to read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement attached as
Appendix A, for a more complete understanding of the merger.

General Information

The Access board of directors and the Middleburg board of directors have each approved the merger agreement and the merger,
which provides for the merger of Middleburg with and into Access.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, as a result of the merger, each share of Middleburg common stock issued and
outstanding before the merger will be converted into the right to receive 1.3314 shares of Access common stock. We sometimes refer to
this as the “exchange ratio.” The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the effective
date of the merger. No fractional shares will be issued; instead cash will be paid for fractional shares.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Access expects that it will issue approximately 9,592,825 shares of Access
common stock to the holders of Middleburg common stock in the merger. At the completion of the merger, it is expected that there will
be issued and outstanding approximately 20,288,125 shares of Access common stock, with current Access shareholders owning
approximately 52.7% of Access’s outstanding common stock, and former holders of Middleburg common stock owning approximately
47.3% of Access’s outstanding common stock.

After the merger, it is expected that Middleburg Bank, the Virginia chartered bank subsidiary of Middleburg, will merge with and
into Access National Bank, the national bank subsidiary of Access. Access National will be the surviving bank in the subsidiary bank
merger, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017.

Background of the Merger

Each of Access and Middleburg’s board of directors and senior management teams have, from time to time, independently
engaged in long term strategic reviews as part of their ongoing duties to enhance shareholder value. These reviews and evaluations
considered the operating environment, competitive landscape, performance history and expected future performance, and have
included periodic discussions concerning potential transactions, operating strategies and the associated risks and benefits.

In February 2016, Middleburg’s board of directors asked investment banking firm Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (or “Sandler
O’Neill”) to assist in a potential sale of stock by its largest beneficial shareholder, David L. Sokol, who had reported a series of sales of
Middleburg common stock with the SEC in late February 2016 and who had expressed to Middleburg’s management an interest in
selling his position in Middleburg’s common stock. On March 30, 2016, Middleburg and representatives of Sandler O’Neill met in-
person with Mr. Sokol to discuss various alternatives for Mr. Sokol to sell his shares, as well as Middleburg’s operating performance
and outlook and challenges facing Middleburg and the community banking industry generally. On March 31, 2016, Mr. Sokol made a
public filing with the SEC in which Mr. Sokol, among other things, suggested that Middleburg initiate a process to explore strategic
alternatives.

In spring of 2016, Middleburg undertook a number of strategic initiatives intended to organically grow its business and to
enhance profitability, improve efficiency and focus on asset quality. At the same time, Middleburg’s board of directors, with the
assistance of Sandler O’Neill, engaged in a process to review and assess its business plan as an independent company, to consider
various alternatives to accelerate growth in Middleburg’s relatively low loan to deposits ratio, and to consider strategic alternatives
with third parties, including acquisitions, sale transactions and strategic mergers.

In the course of Access’s ongoing strategic planning process which included a review of prospective merger candidates, Access
contacted Middleburg in April 2016 after Mr. Sokol’s SEC filing on March 31, 2016. Access management formed a small working
group consisting of Access’s chief executive officer, Michael W. Clarke, chief financial officer, Margaret M Taylor, and Executive Vice
President Robert C. Shoemaker, to conduct a detailed review and analysis of publicly available

information. Access concluded that a “partnership” style transaction with Middleburg could have mutual appeal given the perceived
benefits from the combined balance sheet, complementary business lines, and familiarity of both banks with overlapping markets.

In early May 2016, Access management authorized FBR Capital Markets & Co. (“FBR”) to contact Sandler O’Neill to determine
if Middleburg would be open to a strategic discussion with Access.

At the same time, and as part of its strategic review, Middleburg’s management had identified Access, among others, as a
potential partner in a strategic transaction. In response to FBR’s request, Middleburg’s management authorized Sandler O’Neill to
respond to FBR to set up a conversation between Middleburg chief executive officer Gary R. Shook and a representative of Access.

During the week of May 9, 2016, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook spoke by phone to discuss their respective companies. That telephone
conversation gave rise to an in-person meeting between Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook on May 23, 2016.

At the May 23, 2016 meeting, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook shared views and experiences concerning company background, current
operating performance and outlook, strategic challenges and expected future operating conditions. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook agreed
that increased scale was desirable given a rising regulatory burden and the stringent public policy outlook towards the banking industry.
They further agreed that growing scale through a local combination could best serve the shareholders, clients, employees and the
communities of their respective companies. While Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook generally agreed a transaction could be financially
attractive, pricing was not discussed. The meeting concluded with Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook agreeing to study the idea further and
socialize the idea with the appropriate leadership levels of each company.

On June 15, 2016, at a regularly scheduled meeting of Middleburg’s board of directors, Sandler O’Neill discussed with the board
Middleburg’s historical operating performance relative to peers and financial aspects of various potential alternatives, including
remaining independent, accelerating growth organically or through acquisitions, a strategic merger and a sale transaction. As part of
this discussion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed the recent market for mergers and acquisitions generally and financial aspects of a
combination with Access. In addition, a representative of Williams Mullen, outside legal counsel to Middleburg, reviewed with the
board of directors their fiduciary duties under Virginia law, including a focused summary of fiduciary duties in connection with a
merger. Middleburg’s board of directors discussed the potential benefits of a strategic merger transaction, including a significant
ownership position in the combined company and the potential retention of the Middleburg brand, and of a combination with Access in
particular, including complementary business and geographic footprints, the benefits of scale and the strategic fit of Middleburg’s
strong deposits and wealth management services with Access’s lending and mortgage origination expertise. Middleburg’s board
determined that these considerations were compelling to warrant further consideration of, and to continue a conversation with Access
regarding a strategic combination.

On June 17, 2016, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Shook met to brief one another on feedback from their respective leadership groups and
share ideas on how the companies could operate as a combined entity.

On June 23, 2016, the board of directors of Access discussed the possibility of a transaction with Middleburg and reviewed a
financial analysis prepared by FBR based on publicly available information and management assumptions. Based upon the preliminary
analysis, management was authorized to engage in more detailed discussion with Middleburg regarding a strategic transaction. In doing
so, it was agreed Access would refrain from comprehensive due diligence involving the time and expense of third parties until such
time as company representatives could meet, interview and forge a favorable opinion concerning the potential relationship with
Middleburg’s largest shareholder, Mr. Sokol.

On June 25, 2016, Middleburg entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Mr. Sokol to facilitate discussions with Mr. Sokol
regarding Middleburg’s strategic initiatives, including the potential for a strategic combination with Access.

On July 7, 2016, Messrs. Clarke and Shoemaker met with Mr. Shook and Middleburg’s executive vice president and chief
operating officer, Jeffrey H. Culver. The parties exchanged previously negotiated and executed non-disclosure agreements at the onset
of the meeting to facilitate open discussion covering material non-public information. During this meeting the parties assessed the
preliminary financial and operational feasibility of a potential combination, and reviewed organizational structures and operating
profiles, and identified potential operational efficiencies and cost reductions.

On July 11, 2016, representatives of the boards of directors of Access and Middleburg had a dinner meeting. Those attending
included chairman of the Access board of directors Michael G. Anzilotti, vice chairman of the Access board of directors Martin S.
Friedman and Mr. Clarke from Access, and chairman of the Middleburg board of directors Joseph L. Boling, director (and later
chairman of the Middleburg board of directors) John C. Lee, IV, and Mr. Shook of Middleburg. In the meeting, company and individual
backgrounds where shared along with current views on the industry and each company’s strategic outlook.

On the morning of July 27, 2016, at a regularly scheduled meeting of Middleburg’s board of directors, Middleburg’s management
updated the board of directors on the status of discussions with Access.

Also on July 27, 2016, representatives of each management team and the parties’ respective financial advisors held a work
session to review existing and proposed operating structures, historical and expected financial performance, expected cost savings and
anticipated one-time charges in the event of a strategic transaction. Access was represented by Messrs. Clarke and Shoemaker, Ms.
Taylor, and executive vice president and chief deposit officer of Access National Bank Steven A. Reeder. Middleburg was represented
by Messrs. Shook and Culver. Following the meeting, Access and Middleburg began sharing preliminary due diligence information.

On August 15, 2016 Mr. Anzilotti and Mr. Lee met for a lunch meeting to discuss governance and leadership considerations
related to a possible strategic transaction between Access and Middleburg.

On August 18, 2016, at the Access board meeting, an updated and detailed financial analysis prepared by FBR was reviewed.
FBR provided insights on assumptions, comparative transactions and potential reactions by the market to a combination. The Access
board authorized issuance of a non-binding term sheet to be delivered to the Middleburg Board through Mr. Lee. The term sheet
outlined an illustrative exchange ratio based on post-transaction fully diluted ownership of 55% to 45% by current Access and
Middleburg shareholders, respectively, and the proposed consideration mix and organization structure. The term sheet addressed
proposed governance of Access following a merger by increasing the Access board of directors from 7 to 13 members, and by adding 6
members of the Middleburg board of directors.

On August 23, 2016 Messrs. Lee and Shook met with Messrs. Anzilotti and Clarke to further discuss the term sheet. Financial
objectives and constraints of each party’s interest and preliminary views on valuation were discussed.

In response to differences in financial assumptions and valuations between Access and Middleburg, Mr. Lee suggested the
exchange ratio range be based on the fully diluted ownership split between Access and Middleburg expressed in terms of an ownership
split floor and ceiling. Chairman Lee agreed he would present the indicative range to the Middleburg Board the following day and
asked that Access consider revising the offer set forth in the non-binding term sheet to meet Mr. Lee’s suggested range.

Later on the evening of August 23, 2016 and the following morning on August 24, 2016, a number of communications took place
to identify an acceptable range of ownership for each party to move forward with more extensive due diligence. The parties agreed that
given the overlap of each party’s desired post-transaction fully diluted ownership ranges at 53.5% to 46.5% fully diluted ownership by
current Access and Middleburg shareholders, respectively, they would take the next steps towards an agreement and commence
comprehensive and reciprocal due diligence. Further, Access requested a meeting and interview with Middleburg’s largest shareholder,
Mr. Sokol, individually and jointly with Middleburg.

During a regularly scheduled board meeting on August 24, 2016, representatives of Sandler O’Neill provided an overview of the
Access franchise, including financial and stock price performance, an outline of the preliminary term sheet and review of Middleburg’s
historical operating performance relative to peers, the recent market for mergers and acquisitions generally, the potential financial
implications of a combination with Access and the potential financial implications of other strategic alternatives available to
Middleburg. During the meeting, Middleburg’s board of directors discussed the preliminary term sheet, including the updated fully
diluted ownership target range and the related exchange ratio range, further discussed the potential benefits of a combination with
Access and determined to move forward with discussions with Access and perform additional due diligence of Access.

On September 2, 2016, Access entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Mr. Sokol in order to facilitate the sharing of
material non-public information.

On September 6, 2016, Middleburg’s board of directors held a special meeting to update Middleburg’s board on the progress and
status of discussions with Access.

On September 19, 2016, representatives of both companies and their respective financial advisors met with Mr. Sokol and his
financial advisors, Donnelly Penman & Partners, to discuss progress of the proposed transaction and enable in-person communication
between Mr. Sokol and Messrs. Anzilotti and Clarke. The meeting began with an overview and background of Access followed by a
presentation of the proposed combination at an exchange ratio of 1.3314, which represented post-transaction fully diluted ownership of
53.5% to 46.5% by current Access and Middleburg shareholders, respectively. Following discussion of plans for the proposed company
post-merger, including governance and leadership of the combined company, Messrs. Anzilotti and Clarke met privately with Mr.
Sokol. During the session, plans for the combined company were further discussed, followed by a discussion of the banking industry
and outlook for future M&A activity more generally. Access’s representatives and Mr. Sokol discussed Mr. Sokol’s investment and
expectations in Middleburg as well as outlook for his continued investment in the combined company.

Following the meeting of Messrs. Anzilotti and Clarke and Mr. Sokol, all parties reconvened and agreed there was compelling
case to proceed towards reaching an agreement for a strategic transaction. A timeline and activity overview of the requisite due
diligence to reach a final agreement between the boards was discussed and agreed upon, then distributed to all parties including outside
legal counsel.

On September 21, 2016, at a regularly scheduled meeting of Middleburg’s board, Middleburg’s management updated the board of
directors on the status of discussions with Access. In addition, the board of directors reviewed and discussed the anticipated timeline to
reach a final agreement and authorized management to move forward in performing comprehensive due diligence of Access and
negotiating a merger agreement.

From September 23, 2016 through October 21, 2016, Access and Middleburg, with the assistance of their respective advisors and
representatives, gathered and reviewed comprehensive business, financial and other information concerning each of the companies.
Reviews, discussions and meetings took place remotely and in person. During this time, the parties agreed that holders of Middleburg
common stock would receive, in the merger of Middleburg into Access, only shares of Access common stock.

On October 4, 2016, representatives of Troutman Sanders as outside legal counsel to Access provided a draft of the merger
agreement to representatives of Williams Mullen as outside legal counsel to Middleburg.

On October 5th and 6th, 2016, Access and Middleburg engaged in a two-day, in-person working session to conduct
comprehensive and mutual interviews of top managers overseeing all critical functions of each company. Further, a smaller working
group of representatives from each side worked to refine critical assumptions for the pro forma financial models for the proposed
transaction, including one-time charges and cost savings.

On October 14, 2016, the Access board of directors held a special meeting, at which representatives of FBR and Troutman
Sanders were present, where management reviewed the progress of negotiations with and due diligence on Middleburg. Troutman
Sanders made a presentation and reviewed with the board of directors their fiduciary duties under Virginia law, including a focused
summary of fiduciary duties in connection with a merger. Troutman Sanders then led a review of the draft merger agreement and
related documents and discussed open items pending further negotiation. Included in the documents was a draft voting and standstill
agreement to be entered into between Access, Middleburg and Middleburg’s largest shareholder, Mr. Sokol. Representatives of FBR
then led a review of the updated financial analysis regarding the proposed transaction and discussed the updated financial assumptions.
Through discussion, the board provided feedback and guidance concerning unresolved business matters and instructed Access’s
management to continue to review anticipated cost savings and pro forma financial estimates for the combined company.

Also on October 14, 2016, Middleburg’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of Sandler O’Neill and
Williams Mullen were also present, where management reviewed the progress of negotiations with and due diligence on Access.
Representatives of Sandler O’Neill then led a review of updated financial aspects of the proposed transaction. Representatives of
Williams Mullen reviewed the terms of the draft merger agreement and related documents and the status of negotiations. In addition,
the board of directors reviewed and discussed the draft voting and standstill agreement with Mr. Sokol and the support agreements
contemplated to be executed by each director.

During the week of October 17, 2016 Access held a series of telephonic board meetings to review the status of negotiations.
Further conversations and negotiations of contract terms and an exchange ratio were conducted by all parties and on October 18, 2016
the parties agreed to an exchange ratio of 1.3314 shares of Access common stock for each share of Middleburg common stock, or a
post-transaction fully diluted ownership of 53.5% to 46.5% by current Access and Middleburg shareholders, respectively.

On October 18, 2016, Middleburg’s board of directors held a telephonic meeting to update the board of directors on the status of
negotiations. Representatives of Williams Mullen were present and led a review of the merger agreement, including open items subject
to further negotiation. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill were present and led a discussion of the final exchange ratio and updated
financial aspects of the merger.

Also on October 18, 2016, Access’s board of directors held a special meeting to update the board on the status of negotiations
with Middleburg. At this meeting, Access’s management also reviewed proposed post-closing employment arrangements with certain
executive officers of Middleburg and the proposed voting and standstill agreement with Mr. Sokol. The Access board of directors
authorized Mr. Clarke to communicate to Middleburg that the exchange ratio of 1.3314 is acceptable, subject to final negotiation of
certain closing conditions, post-closing employment arrangements and the voting and standstill agreement with Mr. Sokol.

On October 20, 2016 Access held its regularly scheduled board meeting at which updated analysis was provided. The Access
board of directors reviewed the updated analysis and financial assumptions in connection with the exchange ratio, and updates to the
transaction documents. In connection with the merger, Access’ financial advisor, FBR, delivered an oral opinion at the October 20,
2016 meeting to the Access board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on October 21, 2016, that the merger
consideration to be issued and paid by Access pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, to Access. Following discussion and review, the Board unanimously approved a resolution authorizing
management to finalize all agreements after close of business Friday October 21, 2016 so public announcement and communication
could occur the morning of Monday October 24, 2016.

On October 20, 2016, Middleburg held a special meeting of its board of directors to consider the proposed merger and the merger
agreement. At the meeting, Middleburg’s board of directors received an update from management on the status of the negotiations with
Access. Also at the meeting, representatives of Sandler O’Neill reviewed its financial analysis of the exchange ratio, and delivered to
Middleburg’s board of directors its oral opinion which was subsequently provided in writing to the effect that, as of October 20, 2016,
and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in that opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to holders of Middleburg common stock. Representatives of Williams Mullen discussed with
Middleburg’s board the legal standards applicable to its decisions and actions with respect to the proposed transaction and reviewed in
detail the proposed merger agreement and related agreements, copies of which were delivered to each director before the date of the
meeting. Following these discussions, the Middleburg board unanimously approved the merger and authorized management to finalize
the merger agreement and the related plan of merger.

Access and Middleburg executed the merger agreement on the evening of Friday, October 21, 2016, and before the financial
markets opened on Monday, October 24, 2016, issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the
terms of the merger.

Access’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Access’s Board of Directors

In adopting the merger agreement and recommending approval of the Access merger proposal set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Access’s board of directors consulted with members of Access’s management and with Access’s legal, financial,
and business advisors, and also considered a number of factors that the Access board of directors viewed as supporting its decisions.
The principal factors that the Access board of directors viewed as supporting its decisions are:
 

 
•  the expectation that the merger will create a $2.7 billion-asset bank ranked fifth in deposit market-share among Virginia-

based banks under $10 billion in assets;
 

 
•  the belief that the merger will allow the combined company to more effectively and efficiently navigate the challenges and

costs associated with becoming a larger financial institution, and the challenges of the current and prospective economic,
regulatory and competitive environments facing Access and the financial services industry generally;

Table of Contents

 
•  the expectation that the combined company will have increased resources to invest in future growth opportunities in

comparison to Access on a stand-alone basis;
 

 •  the complementary nature of Middleburg’s business, operations and proficiencies with those of Access;
 

 
•  the opportunities for greater efficiencies from conducting Access’s and Middleburg’s operations as part of a single

enterprise;
 

 
•  the expectation that the combination will enhance geographic, industry and client diversity of the combined company’s loan

and deposit portfolios, as compared to the loan and deposit portfolios of Access and Middleburg on a stand-alone basis;
 

 •  the fact that the merger will expand Access’s operations into the Richmond and southeast Virginia banking markets;
 

 
•  the benefits associated with revenue diversification driven by fee income business lines of the combined company, with pro

forma fee income representing more than 30% of pro forma revenue of the combined company;
 

 
•  the expectation that the merger will result in earnings per share accretion to Access’s shareholders of more than 7.5% in

2017 and more than 10% in 2018 (the first full year of operations as a combined company), tangible book value dilution of
less than 1.0% and a tangible book value earn-back period less than one fiscal quarter;

 

 
•  Middleburg’s financial condition, earnings, business, operations, depository base and asset quality, taking into account

publicly-filed information and the results of Access’ due diligence of Middleburg; and
 

 
•  the oral opinion of FBR & Co., delivered on October 20, 2016 to the Access board of directors and subsequently confirmed

in writing on October 21, 2016, that the merger consideration to be issued and paid by Access pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to Access.

In addition to considering the factors described above, the Access Board of Directors also considered the following factors:
 

 •  the proposed governance and management of Access following the merger;
 

 •  the financial and other terms of the proposed transaction as outlined in the merger agreement;
 

 
•  Middleburg’s largest shareholder and Access’s understanding of his intentions with respect to ownership of Access common

stock;
 

 •  the market for alternative merger or acquisition candidates and the likelihood and timing of other strategic transactions;
 

 
•  the probability and likelihood of timely approvals from regulatory authorities and any expected conditions associated with

approvals;
 

 •  the risks and costs associated with integrating Middleburg’s business, operations and employees with those of Access;
 

 
•  the risks of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Access’ business in planning for the merger

and executing integration plans;
 

 
•  the risks of not being able to realize all of the anticipated cost savings and operational synergies between Access and

Middleburg and the risk that other anticipated benefits might not be realized; and
 

 
•  the termination fee payable, under certain circumstances, by Access to Middleburg, including the risk that the termination

fee might discourage third parties from proposing an alternate transaction or would increase the cost of an alternate
transaction.

The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by Access’s board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but, rather, includes the material factors considered by it in connection with its evaluation of the merger. In reaching its
determination to approve and adopt the merger agreement and recommend that Access’s shareholders approve the Access merger
proposal, Access’s board of directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the factors
considered in reaching that determination. In addition, Access’s board of directors did not undertake to make any specific determination
as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support

its ultimate determination. Moreover, in considering the information and factors described above, individual directors may have given
differing weights to different factors. Access’s board of directors based its determination on the totality of the information presented.

Access’s board of directors determined that the merger agreement is in the best interests of Access and its shareholders.
Accordingly, Access’s board of directors approved and adopted the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that
shareholders vote “FOR” the Access merger proposal.

Middleburg’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendations of Middleburg’s Board of Directors

In adopting the merger agreement and recommending approval of the Middleburg merger proposal set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Middleburg’s board of directors evaluated the merger proposal in consultation with members of Middleburg’s
management and with Middleburg’s legal, financial, and business advisors, and also considered a number of positive factors, including
the following material factors:
 

 
•  the expectation that the merger will create a $2.7 billion-asset bank, ranked fifth in deposit market-share among Virginia-

based banks under $10 billion in assets;
 

 
•  Middleburg’s historical financial performance, prospects for the future, projected financial results and alternatives for loan

growth on a stand-alone basis, and the belief that the combined company will have increased resources and ability to
accelerate growth in comparison to Middleburg on a stand-alone basis;

 

 
•  the potential for Middleburg’s shareholders to benefit from the combined company’s expected profitability and potential for

growth and stock appreciation, and the expectation that the combined company will have superior future earnings and
prospects compared to Middleburg’s earnings and prospects on a stand-alone basis;

 

 

•  the expected increase in cash dividend payments to be received by Middleburg’s shareholders, as shareholders of Access
following the merger, due to the current quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.15 per share paid by Access (or $0.19971 per
share of Middleburg stock converted into Access stock in connection with the merger, taking into account the 1.3314
exchange ratio) versus the most recent quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.12 per share paid by Middleburg, although
Access has no obligation to pay future dividends in any particular amounts or at any particular times;

 

 
•  the belief that the combined company will be able to more effectively and efficiently navigate the challenges of the current

and prospective economic, regulatory and competitive environments facing Middleburg and the financial services industry
generally;

 

 
•  the expectation of cost savings and greater efficiencies from conducting Access’s and Middleburg’s operations as part of a

larger, single enterprise;
 

 
•  its review and diligence of Access’s business, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings and prospects, and the

complementary nature of Middleburg’s business, operations and proficiencies with those of Access;
 

 
•  the ability to leverage the combination of Middleburg’s strong retail deposit franchise and wealth management experience

with Access’s expertise in business banking, commercial and industrial lending and mortgage origination;
 

 
•  the expectation that the combination will enhance geographic, industry and client diversity of the loan and deposit

portfolios;
 

 •  the benefits associated with the diversification and balance of the combined company’s revenues;
 

 
•  the continued representation of Middleburg’s management on the management team and board of directors of the combined

company;
 

 
•  the potential for increased liquidity in the market for common stock and the opportunity for higher trading multiples of book

value and EPS of the combined company, versus Middleburg independently;
 

 •  the value of the merger consideration relative to the historical market value, book value and earnings of Middleburg;
 

 
•  the financial presentation, dated October 20, 2016, of Sandler O’Neill to Middleburg’s board of directors and the opinion of

Sandler O’Neill, dated October 20, 2016, to Middleburg’s board of directors, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger was fair to the holders of Middleburg common stock from a financial point of view; and

•  the terms of the merger, including the expected tax treatment, deal protection and termination fee provisions, which

Middleburg reviewed with its outside legal advisor.

In addition to considering the factors described above, Middleburg’s board of directors also considered a number of potential risks
and uncertainties associated with the merger in connection with its deliberations on the merger, including the following material
factors:
 

 
•  the probability and likelihood of timely approvals from regulatory authorities and any expected conditions associated with

approvals;
 

 •  the risks and costs associated with integrating Middleburg’s business, operations and employees with those of Access;
 

 
•  the risks of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Middleburg’s business in planning for the

merger and executing integration plans, and the possibility of employee attrition or adverse effects on client and business
relationships as a result of the announcement and pendency of the merger;

 

 
•  the risks of not being able to realize all of the anticipated cost savings and operational synergies between Access and

Middleburg and the risk that other anticipated benefits might not be realized; and
 

 
•  the termination fee payable, under certain circumstances, by Middleburg to Access, including the risk that the termination

fee might discourage third parties from offering to acquire Middleburg by increasing the cost of a third-party acquisition.

In the judgment of Middleburg’s board of directors, the potential benefits of the merger outweigh these considerations.

The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by Middleburg’s board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but, rather, includes the material factors considered by it in connection with its evaluation of the merger. In reaching its
determination to approve and adopt the merger agreement and recommend that Middleburg’s shareholders approve the Middleburg
merger proposal, Middleburg’s board of directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the
factors considered in reaching that determination. In addition, Middleburg’s board of directors did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination.
Moreover, in considering the information and factors described above, individual directors may have given differing weights to
different factors. Middleburg’s board of directors based its determination on the totality of the information presented.

Middleburg’s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement is in the best interests of Middleburg
and its shareholders. Accordingly, Middleburg’s board of directors unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement
and unanimously recommends that shareholders vote “FOR” the Middleburg merger proposal.

Opinion of Access’s Financial Advisor

Access engaged FBR to act as its exclusive financial advisor, including providing an opinion to the Access board of directors as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Access of the consideration to be paid by Access in the merger. In the ordinary course
of its investment banking business, FBR is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions.

In connection with its engagement, representatives of FBR participated via telephonic conference in the meeting of the Access
board of directors held on October 20, 2016 at which the Access board of directors evaluated the merger. At this meeting, FBR
reviewed the financial aspects of the merger and rendered an oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of such date, the
consideration to be paid by Access in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Access.

The summary of FBR’s opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
FBR’s written opinion, which is included as Appendix B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and sets forth the procedures
followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered by FBR in preparing
its opinion.

FBR’s opinion was directed to the Access board of directors (in its capacity as such), and only addressed the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Access of the consideration to be issued and paid by Access in the merger. It is not intended to and should
not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of FBR to the Access board of directors, Access, Middleburg, any security
holder of Access or any other party. It does not constitute a recommendation to the Access board of directors, Access, Middleburg, any
security holder of Access or any other person as to how to act or vote on any matter relating to the merger or otherwise.

•  the audited financial statements and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and the

Middleburg;
 

 

•  reviewed certain financial forecasts for Middleburg prepared by the management of Middleburg (the “Middleburg Financial
Forecasts”), and adjustments thereto and extensions thereof prepared by the management of Access to take into account
certain projected cost savings, including the amount and timing thereof, expected by the management of Access to result
from the merger (as adjusted, the “Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts”);

 

 

•  reviewed certain publicly available consensus “street estimates” for Access affirmed to FBR by management of Access (the
“Access Consensus Projections”) and certain additional financial forecasts for Access provided to FBR by the management
of Access (the “Access Management Financial Forecasts” and, together with the Access Consensus Projections, the “Access
Financial Forecasts”);

 

 
•  reviewed certain non-public internal financial information and other data relating to Access and Middleburg that were

provided to FBR by Access and Middleburg for the purpose of FBR’s analysis and accordingly on which basis FBR
prepared its analysis;

 

 

•  met with certain members of the senior management of Middleburg to discuss the business and prospects of Middleburg, and
with certain members of the senior management of Access to discuss the business and prospects of Middleburg and Access,
and the projected cost savings, including the amount and timing thereof, expected by the management of Access to result
from the merger, and relied on the statements made by such persons;

 

 
•  reviewed certain publicly available information with respect to certain other companies FBR believed to be generally

above relating to Middleburg and Access; and
 

 
•  conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations and considered such other financial, economic and

market criteria that we deemed relevant.

and FBR did not assume any responsibility with respect to such data, material and other information. With respect to the Middleburg
Financial Forecasts, management of Middleburg advised FBR, and FBR assumed, that the Middleburg Financial Forecasts were
reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
Middleburg with respect to the future financial performance of Middleburg. With respect to the Adjusted Middleburg Financial
Forecasts, management of Access advised FBR, and FBR assumed, that the Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts were reasonably
prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Access with
respect to the future financial performance of Middleburg following the consummation of the merger, after giving effect to the
projected cost savings, including the amount and timing thereof, expected by the management of Access to result from the merger.
With respect to the Access Financial Forecasts, the management of Access advised FBR, and FBR assumed, that the Access Consensus
Projections are reasonable and achievable, and that the Access Financial Forecasts were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Access, in each case with respect to the future
financial performance of Access. FBR relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the management of Access with
respect to the timing and risks associated with the integration of the businesses of Access and Middleburg and the risks associated with
Access and Middleburg’s current and contemplated products, services and business models. FBR expressed no view or opinion with
respect to the Middleburg Financial Forecasts, the Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts, the Access Financial Forecasts or the
assumptions on which they are based including, without limitation, the projected cost savings expected by Access’s management to
result from the merger, which cost savings, at the direction of Access’s management, FBR assumed will be achieved in the amounts
and at the times indicated thereby. Access’s management advised FBR and FBR has assumed, without undertaking any responsibility
for the independent verification thereof, that the Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts, the Access Financial Forecasts and the
assumptions on which they are based were a reasonable basis on which to evaluate Middleburg, Access and the proposed merger and,
at the direction of Access’s management, FBR used and relied upon the Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts and the Access
Financial Forecasts for purposes of FBR’s analyses and FBR’s opinion. FBR also relied upon and assumed, without independent
verification, that there was no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or
prospects of Middleburg or Access since the dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise,
provided to FBR that would be material to FBR’s analyses or this opinion, and that there was no information or any facts or
developments that would make any of the information reviewed by FBR incomplete or misleading. FBR also assumed, with the
consent of Access’s management, that (i) in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements in
connection with the merger (which FBR assumes will be obtained), no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on Middleburg, Access or the contemplated benefits of the merger; (ii) the representations and warranties
made by the parties in the merger agreement are accurate and complete in all respects material to FBR’s analyses and FBR’s opinion;
(iii) each party to the merger agreement will perform in all material respects all of its covenants and obligations thereunder; (iv) the
merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
term, condition or provision thereof that is material to FBR’s analyses or FBR’s opinion; and (v) the merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. FBR also assumed that the
merger agreement and subsidiary bank merger agreement, when executed by the relevant parties thereto, will conform to the drafts of
such agreements and other documents reviewed by FBR in all respects material to FBR’s analyses.

FBR’s opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Access of the merger consideration to be issued and
paid by Access in respect of the outstanding shares of Middleburg common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement and
does not address any other aspect or implication of the merger or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in
connection therewith or otherwise, including, without limitation, the form or, except to the extent expressly provided herein, the
amounts of the merger consideration to be issued and paid in the merger; the allocation of the outstanding Access common stock after
giving effect to the merger as between the current holders of Access common stock and the current holders of Middleburg common
stock or any individual members or groups thereof; the dilutive or other effects of the merger on the existing holders of Access
common stock; the solvency or fair value of Access, Middleburg or any other entity or person or their respective assets or liabilities
under any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters; any tax implications of the merger to
Access or its security holders or any other party; the fairness of any portion or aspect of the merger to the current holders of any class
of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Access, Middleburg or to any other party; or the fairness of the amount or nature of, or
any other aspect relating to, any compensation or consideration to be received by or otherwise payable to any officers, directors,
employees, security holders or affiliates of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be
paid to Middleburg’s shareholders or otherwise.

FBR did not express any opinion or provide any advice, counsel or interpretation, with respect to matters that require legal,
regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. FBR assumed that any such opinions, advice, counsel or
interpretations have been or will be obtained by Access from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, with the consent of
Access’s management, FBR relied upon the assessments by Access and its other advisors as to all legal, regulatory, accounting,
insurance and tax matters with respect to Access, Middleburg and the merger.

FBR’s opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to FBR as of the date of its opinion and financial, economic,
market and other conditions were evaluated as they existed as of the date of its opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect
this opinion, FBR assumes no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. As Access’s management is aware, the credit,
financial and stock markets may experience significant volatility. FBR expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such
volatility on Access, Middleburg or the merger. FBR’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to
alternative transactions or strategies that might be available to Access, Middleburg or any other party to the merger, nor does it address
the underlying business decision of the board of directors of Access, Middleburg, or any other party to proceed with the merger.
Furthermore, in connection with this opinion, FBR was not requested to make, and did not make, any physical inspection or
independent appraisal or evaluation of any of the assets, properties or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Access, Middleburg, or
any other party. In addition, FBR did not receive or review any individual credit files nor make an independent evaluation or appraisal
of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Access, Middleburg, or
any of their respective subsidiaries. FBR is not an expert in the evaluation of loan, lease, investment or trading portfolios for purposes
of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for losses with respect thereto and, accordingly, FBR assumed that such allowances for
losses are adequate to cover such losses. FBR did not express any opinion as to what the value of Access common stock actually will
be when issued pursuant to the merger, or the price or range of prices at which Access common stock or Middleburg common stock
may be purchased or sold at any time. With the consent of Access’s management, FBR assumed that the Access common stock to be
issued in the merger will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.

In preparing its opinion to the Access board of directors, FBR performed a variety of analyses, including those described below.
The summary of FBR’s financial analyses is not a complete description of the analyses underlying FBR’s opinion. The preparation of
such an opinion is a complex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to the
financial, comparative and other analytic methods employed and the adaptation and application of those methods to the unique facts
and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither FBR’s opinion nor the analyses underlying its opinion are readily susceptible
to partial analysis or summary description. FBR arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed
as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis, analytic method or factor.
Accordingly, FBR believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, analytic methods
and factors, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.

In performing its analyses, FBR considered business, economic, industry and market conditions, financial and otherwise, and
other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. No company, business or merger used in FBR’s
financial analyses for comparative purposes is identical to Access, Middleburg or the proposed merger. While the results of each
analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall conclusion, FBR did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding
individual analyses. The multiples and valuation reference ranges indicated by FBR’s financial analyses are illustrative and not
necessarily indicative of actual values nor predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors,
many of which are beyond Access’ control and the control of FBR. Much of the information used in, and accordingly the results of,
FBR’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

FBR’s opinion and analyses were provided to the Access board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its
consideration of the proposed merger and were among many factors considered by the Access board of directors in evaluating the
proposed merger. Neither FBR’s opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the consideration or of the views of the Access board of
directors with respect to the proposed merger.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by FBR in connection with the preparation of its oral
opinion rendered to the Access board on October 20, 2016, which was subsequently confirmed in writing by FBR to

the Access board on October 21, 2016. The analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations
affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of FBR’s analyses.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, (1) share prices for the selected companies used in the selected comparable public
companies analysis described below were closing sale prices as of October 19, 2016; (2) estimates of financial performance of
Middleburg were based on the Middleburg Financial Forecasts; (3) estimates of financial performance for the selected companies listed
below for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 were based on publicly available
research analyst estimates for those companies; and (4) the merger values for the selected mergers used in the selected mergers analysis
described below were based on the value of the consideration proposed to be paid in the selected mergers as of the date of the
announcement.

Based on the merger consideration of 1.3314 shares of Access common stock per share of Middleburg common stock, FBR
calculated an implied value of the merger consideration of $34.00 per share of Middleburg common stock, based on the closing price
per share of Access common stock of $25.54 as of October 19, 2016.

Selected Comparable Public Companies Analysis. FBR considered certain financial data for Middleburg and selected companies

FBR applied multiple ranges based on the 25th to 75th percentiles of Price/2016E EPS, Price/2017E EPS, Price/2018E EPS and
Price/TBV to corresponding financial data for Middleburg. FBR assumed and applied a 25% control premium to these values to
account for the ownership, control and operation of Middleburg and Middleburg Bank by Access following the consummation of the
merger. The selected comparable public companies analysis indicated implied valuation reference ranges per share of Middleburg
common stock of $26.80 to $29.65 based on the Price/2016E EPS multiples, $27.99 to $29.90 based on the Price/2017E EPS multiples,
$25.76 to $30.43 based on the Price/2018E EPS multiples and $24.52 to $34.72 based on the Price/TBV multiples.

Selected Precedent Transactions. FBR also considered the financial terms of certain business combinations. The precedent
transactions were selected because the characteristics of the seller were deemed to be similar to Middleburg in one or more respects.

The financial data reviewed included:
 

 •  Price as a premium to market capitalization one trading day prior to announcement date (“Premium to Current Market”);
 

 •  Price as a multiple of last-twelve-months earnings per share (“Price/LTM EPS”);
 

 
•  Price as a multiple of estimated earnings per share for the next fiscal year following announcement date (“Price/FY1 EPS”);

and
 

 •  Price as a multiple of tangible book value as of the most recently reported fiscal quarter (“Price/TBV”).

FBR applied multiple ranges based on the 25th to 75th percentiles of Premium to Current Market, Price/LTM EPS, Price/FYI

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. FBR performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Middleburg based on the Middleburg
Financial Forecasts, which do not take into account the cost savings expected by management to result from the merger, and the
Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts, which take into account the cost savings expected by management to result from the merger.
FBR applied a range of terminal value multiples of 15.5x to 17.5x to an estimate of Middleburg’s 2022 free cash flow, calculated by
applying a 9.0% growth rate to the estimated 2021 free cash flow in both the Middleburg Financial Forecasts and Adjusted Middleburg
Financial Forecasts. The estimated net present value of the projected future cash flow and terminal values, as of the opinion date, were
then calculated using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 13.5%.

Table of Contents

The discounted cash flow analysis using the Middleburg Financial Forecasts indicated an implied valuation reference range per
share of Middleburg common stock of approximately $29.38 to $31.58, based on the 25th to 75th percentiles. FBR assumed and
applied a 25% control premium to these values to account for the ownership, control and operation of Middleburg and Middleburg
Bank by Access following the consummation of the merger. The discounted cash flow analysis, taking into account the 25% control
premium, indicated an implied valuation reference range per share of Middleburg common stock of approximately $36.73 to $39.48,
based on the 25th to 75th percentiles.

The discounted cash flow analysis using the Adjusted Middleburg Financial Forecasts indicated an implied valuation reference
range per share of Middleburg common stock of approximately $39.04 to $42.21, based on the 25th to 75th percentiles.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis. FBR analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger, based on the following
assumptions: (i) the merger closes on March 31, 2017; (ii) 100% of the outstanding shares of Middleburg common stock are converted
into the stock consideration at the fixed exchange ratio of 1.3314; (iii) 100% of Middleburg stock options are cashed out, based upon
the terms of the merger agreement; and (iv) 100% of Middleburg warrants are converted into Access warrants, based upon the guidance
of Access and Middleburg management. FBR also utilized assumptions, as provided by Access and Middleburg management, relating
to (a) estimated transaction costs and expenses, (b) purchase accounting adjustments, and (c) estimated cost savings resulting from the
merger. The analysis indicated the merger would be accretive to Access’ estimated earnings per share in 2017 and 2018 (the first full
year after the assumed closing of the merger) and nominally dilutive to estimated tangible book value per share at closing with an earn
back period of less than one fiscal quarter.

In connection with this analysis, FBR considered and discussed with the Access board of directors how the analysis would be
affected by changes in the underlying assumptions, including the impact of final purchase accounting adjustments determined at the
closing of the merger, and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the
variations may be material.

Other Matters. Access selected FBR as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger based on FBR’s
experience and reputation and FBR’s knowledge of Access and its industry. FBR will receive a transaction fee of $1,015,000 for its
services as financial advisor to Access in connection with the merger, which is contingent upon the successful completion of the
merger. FBR received a fee of $35,000 upon entering into an engagement letter with Access in connection with the proposed merger
and a fee of $200,000 for rendering its opinion, both of which were not contingent upon the successful completion of the merger. In
addition, Access has also agreed to indemnify FBR and certain related parties for certain liabilities arising out of or related to FBR’s
engagement and to reimburse FBR for certain of its legal and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement.

FBR is a full-service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as providing investment
banking and other financial services. In its ordinary course of business, FBR and its affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for its and its
affiliates’ own accounts and the accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments (including bank loans
and other obligations) of Access, Middleburg, certain of their affiliates and any other company that may be involved in the merger.

In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, FBR did not provide any other investment banking services to Access,
Middleburg and certain of their respective affiliates, for which compensation was received. FBR and its affiliates may in the future
provide investment banking and other financial services to Access, Middleburg and certain of their respective affiliates, for which FBR
and its affiliates would expect to receive compensation. FBR has adopted policies and procedures designed to preserve the
independence of its research and credit analysts whose views may differ from those of the members of the team of investment banking
professionals that are advising Access.

Table of Contents

Sandler O’Neill acted as financial advisor in connection with the proposed transaction and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to the execution of the merger agreement. At the October 20, 2016 meeting at which MBRG’s board of directors
considered and discussed the terms of the merger agreement and the merger, Sandler O’Neill delivered to MBRG’s board of directors
its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on October 20, 2016, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange
ratio provided for in the merger was fair to the holders of MBRG common stock from a financial point of view. The full text of
Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Appendix C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion outlines the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by
Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the opinion. Holders of MBRG common stock are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with
their consideration of the proposed merger.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was directed to MBRG’s board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the merger agreement and the merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any shareholder of MBRG as to how any such shareholder should vote at any meeting of shareholders
called to consider and vote upon the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was directed
only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of MBRG common stock and does not
address the underlying business decision of MBRG to engage in the merger, the form or structure of the merger or any other
transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative
transactions or business strategies that might exist for MBRG or the effect of any other transaction in which MBRG might
engage. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in
the merger by any officer, director or employee of MBRG or Access (or, for the purposes of this section, “ANCX”), or any class of
such persons, if any, relative to the compensation to be received in the merger by any other shareholder, including the exchange ratio to
be received by the holders of MBRG common stock. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion
committee.

In connection with its opinion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed and considered, among other things:
 

 •  a draft of the merger agreement, dated October 19, 2016;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of MBRG that Sandler O’Neill

deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of ANCX that Sandler O’Neill

deemed relevant;
 

 

•  certain financial projections for MBRG for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 and estimated long-
term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for MBRG, as provided by the respective senior
managements of MBRG and ANCX, that were prepared by such senior managements to reflect MBRG’s recent financial
performance and that Sandler O’Neill was directed by MBRG to rely upon and utilize for purposes of its analysis and its
opinion;

 

 
•  mean publicly available analyst estimates for ANCX for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and

December 31, 2018, as well as estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for ANCX,
as provided by the senior management of ANCX;

 

 
•  the pro forma financial impact of the merger on ANCX based on certain assumptions relating to purchase accounting

adjustments, cost savings and transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management of ANCX;
 

 •  the relative contribution of assets, liabilities, equity and earnings of MBRG and ANCX to the combined entity;
 

 

•  the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for MBRG’s common stock and ANCX’s common stock, including
a comparison of certain stock market information for MBRG common stock and ANCX common stock and certain stock
indices as well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies, the securities of which are publicly
traded;

 

 
•  a comparison of certain financial information for MBRG and ANCX with similar institutions for which information is

publicly available;
 

 
•  the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry on a nationwide basis, to the extent

publicly available;
 

 •  the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and

•  such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria as Sandler

O’Neill considered relevant.

Sandler O’Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of MBRG the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of MBRG and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior management of ANCX
regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of ANCX.

In performing its review, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information
that was available to and reviewed by it from public sources, that was provided to Sandler O’Neill by MBRG or ANCX or their
respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by Sandler O’Neill, and Sandler O’Neill assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion without any independent verification or investigation. Sandler O’Neill relied on
the assurances of the respective managements of MBRG and ANCX that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
have made any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Sandler O’Neill had not been asked to and did not undertake an
independent verification of any of such information and did not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness
thereof. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing
assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of MBRG or ANCX or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor was Sandler O’Neill
furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Sandler O’Neill rendered no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets
or the future performance of any loans of MBRG or ANCX. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses of MBRG or ANCX, or of the combined entity after the merger, and it did not review any individual
credit files relating to MBRG or ANCX. Sandler O’Neill assumed, with MBRG’s consent, that the respective allowances for loan
losses for both MBRG and ANCX were adequate to cover such losses and would be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined
entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used certain financial projections for MBRG for the years ending December 31, 2016
and December 31, 2017 and estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for MBRG, as provided
by the respective senior managements of MBRG and ANCX, as well as mean publicly available analyst estimates for ANCX for the
years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate,
dividend and other assumptions for ANCX, as provided by the senior management of ANCX. Sandler O’Neill also received and used
in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and transaction expenses, as
provided by the senior management of ANCX. With respect to the foregoing information, the respective senior managements of
MBRG and ANCX confirmed to Sandler O’Neill that such information reflected (or, in the case of the mean publicly available analyst
estimates referred to above, were consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of those respective senior
managements as to the future financial performance of MBRG and ANCX, respectively, and the other matters covered thereby, and
Sandler O’Neill assumed that the future financial performance reflected in such information would be achieved. Sandler O’Neill
expressed no opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which such information was based. Sandler O’Neill also assumed
that there had been no material change in the respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of
MBRG or ANCX since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to it. Sandler O’Neill assumed in all respects
material to its analysis that MBRG and ANCX would remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to its analysis.

Sandler O’Neill also assumed, with MBRG’s consent, that (i) each of the parties to the merger agreement would comply in all
material respects with all material terms and conditions of the merger agreement and all related agreements, that all of the
representations and warranties contained in such agreements were true and correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to
such agreements would perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such
party under such agreements and that the conditions precedent in such agreements were not and would not be waived, (ii) in the course
of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the merger, no delay, limitation,
restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on MBRG, ANCX or the merger or any related
transaction, (iii) the merger and any related transactions would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement
without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all
applicable laws and other requirements, and (iv) the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
Finally, with MBRG’s consent, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the advice that MBRG received from its legal, accounting and tax advisors
as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to any such matters.

Table of Contents

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to it as of, the date thereof. Events occurring after the date thereof could materially affect Sandler O’Neill’s
opinion. Sandler O’Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion or otherwise comment upon events
occurring after the date thereof. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to the trading values of MBRG common stock or ANCX
common stock at any time or what the value of MBRG common stock would be once it is actually received by the holders of MBRG
common stock.

In rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill performed a variety of financial analyses. The summary below is not a complete
description of the analyses underlying Sandler O’Neill’s opinion or the presentation made by Sandler O’Neill to MBRG’s board of
directors, but is a summary of all material analyses performed and presented by Sandler O’Neill. The summary includes information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, these tables must be read together with the
accompanying text. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. The process, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to a
partial analysis or summary description. Sandler O’Neill believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of the factors and analyses to be considered without considering all factors and analyses, or attempting to ascribe relative
weights to some or all such factors and analyses, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion.
Also, no company included in Sandler O’Neill’s comparative analyses described below is identical to MBRG or ANCX and no
transaction is identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of comparable companies or transactions involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that
could affect the public trading values or merger transaction values, as the case may be, of MBRG and ANCX and the companies to
which they are being compared. In arriving at its opinion, Sandler O’Neill did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or
factor that it considered. Rather, Sandler O’Neill made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. Sandler O’Neill did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative) considered in
isolation supported or failed to support its opinion, rather, Sandler O’Neill made its determination as to the fairness of the exchange
ratio on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all its analyses taken as a whole.

In performing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill also made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and
economic conditions and various other matters, many of which are beyond the control of MBRG, ANCX and Sandler O’Neill. The
analyses performed by Sandler O’Neill are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, both of which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Sandler O’Neill prepared its analyses solely for purposes of
rendering its opinion and provided such analyses to MBRG’s board of directors at its October 20, 2016 meeting. Estimates on the
values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or their securities may actually
be sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and actual values may be materially different. Accordingly, Sandler
O’Neill’s analyses do not necessarily reflect the value of MBRG common stock or the prices at which MBRG common stock or ANCX
common stock may be sold at any time. The analyses of Sandler O’Neill and its opinion were among a number of factors taken into
consideration by MBRG’s board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and should not be viewed as
determinative of the exchange ratio or the decision of MBRG’s board of directors or management with respect to the fairness of the
merger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation between MBRG and ANCX.

Summary of Proposed Exchange Ratio and Implied Transaction Metrics. Sandler O’Neill reviewed the financial terms of the
proposed merger. Using the closing price of ANCX common stock on October 19, 2016 of $25.54 for valuing ANCX common stock
issuable in the merger and ANCX common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of MBRG warrants that were outstanding
on October 20, 2016 and would convert into ANCX warrants in the merger, Sandler O’Neill calculated an aggregate implied
transaction value of approximately $243.9 million, or an implied transaction price per share of MBRG common stock of $34.00. Based
upon historical financial information for MBRG as or for the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended June 30, 2016 and projected financial
information for 2016 and 2017 as provided by the respective senior managements of MBRG and ANCX, Sandler O’Neill calculated
the following implied transaction metrics.
 

Transaction Price / Tangible Book Value Per Share of MBRG:    194% 
Transaction Price / Last Twelve Months Earnings Per Share of MBRG:    31.2x  
Transaction Price / 2016E Earnings Per Share of MBRG:    24.1x  
Transaction Price / 2017E Earnings Per Share of MBRG:    21.6x  
Core Deposit Premium1:    13.6% 
One Day Market Premium to March 30, 2016 MBRG Closing Stock Price:    66.2%2 
One Day Market Premium to October 19, 2016 MBRG Closing Stock Price:    23.8% 

 
1) Tangible book premium to core deposits calculated as deal value less tangible common equity, as a percentage of core deposits

(defined as total deposits less time deposits with balances over $100,000).
2) Based on MBRG’s closing price of $20.46 on March 30, 2016 before initial 13D was filed by MBRG’s largest shareholder.

Contribution Analysis. Sandler O’Neill reviewed the relative contribution of various balance sheet and income statement items to
be made by MBRG and ANCX to the combined entity based on financial information for both companies as of or for the period ended
June 30, 2016 and for 2016 and 2017 as provided by the respective managements of MBRG and ANCX in the case of MBRG or based
on mean publicly available analyst estimates for ANCX. The results of this analysis are set forth in the following table, which also
compares the results of this analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of MBRG and ANCX shareholders in the
combined company based on the 1.3314x exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement and the fully diluted shares of MBRG
common stock assuming exercise of warrants and options:
 

   ANCX  MBRG 
Balance Sheet    
Gross Loans Held For Investment    52.5%   47.5% 
Total Assets    49.8%   50.2% 
Core Deposits1    49.1%   50.9% 
Total Deposits    49.7%   50.3% 
Tangible Common Equity    48.3%   51.7% 
Income Statement    
Last Twelve Months Net Income to Common Shareholders    68.3%   31.7% 
2016E Net Income to Common Shareholders    63.1%   36.9% 
2017E Net Income to Common Shareholders    59.3%   40.7% 

Pro Forma Ownership2    53.5%   46.5% 
 
1) Core deposits equal total deposits less time deposits with balances over $100,000.
2) Assumes 7,230,821 MBRG shares (assuming exercise of options and warrants) are exchanged for ANCX shares.

Stock Trading History. Sandler O’Neill reviewed the historical stock price performance of MBRG common stock and ANCX
common stock for the three-year period ended October 19, 2016. Sandler O’Neill then compared the relationship between the stock
price performance of MBRG’s common stock and ANCX’s common stock, respectively, to movements in their respective peer groups
(as described below) as well as certain stock indices.

Comparable Company Analyses. Sandler O’Neill used publicly available information to compare selected financial information
for MBRG with a group of financial institutions, including ANCX, selected by Sandler O’Neill (the “MBRG Peer Group”). The
MBRG Peer Group consisted of major exchange traded banks and thrifts headquartered in District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia,
and West Virginia with assets between $750 million and $5 billion, excluding announced merger targets. The MBRG Peer Group
consisted of ANCX and the following companies:
 

American National Bankshares Inc.   Old Line Bancshares, Inc.

C&F Financial Corporation   Old Point Financial Corporation

City Holding Company   Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc.

Community Bankers Trust Corporation   Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc.

First United Corporation   Summit Financial Group, Inc.

Howard Bancorp, Inc.   WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc.

The analysis compared financial information for MBRG provided by MBRG as of or for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016
(unless otherwise noted) with the corresponding publicly available data for the MBRG Peer Group as of or for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2016 (unless otherwise noted), with pricing data as of October 19, 2016. The table below sets forth the data for MBRG

2) Based on median publicly available analyst estimates except, in the case of MBRG, for which 2016 and 2017 earnings

projections were provided by the respective senior managements of MBRG and ANCX.

Sandler O’Neill used publicly available information to perform a similar analysis for ANCX and a group of financial institutions,
including MBRG, selected by Sandler O’Neill (the “ANCX Peer Group”). The ANCX Peer Group consisted of major exchange traded
banks and thrifts headquartered in District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia with assets between $750 million and
$5 billion, excluding announced merger targets. The ANCX Peer Group consisted of MBRG and the same companies as in the MBRG
Peer Group (other than ANCX).

The analysis compared financial information for ANCX provided by ANCX as of or for the twelve months ended September 30,
2016 (unless otherwise noted) with the corresponding publicly available data for the ANCX Peer Group as of or for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2016 (unless otherwise noted), with pricing data as of October 19, 2016. The table below sets forth the data for ANCX
and the high, low, median and mean data for the ANCX Peer Group.

Using the latest publicly available information prior to the announcement of the relevant transaction, Sandler O’Neill reviewed
the following transaction metrics: transaction price to last-twelve-months earnings per share, transaction price to forward year
estimated earnings per share, transaction price to tangible book value per share, tangible book premium to core deposits, and 1-day
market premium. Sandler O’Neill compared the indicated transaction multiples for the merger to the high, low, mean and median
multiples of the Precedent Transactions group.

Net Present Value Analyses. Sandler O’Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of MBRG
common stock assuming MBRG performed in accordance with financial projections for the years ending December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2017 and estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions as provided by the
respective senior managements of MBRG and ANCX. To approximate the terminal value of a share of MBRG common stock at
December 31, 2020, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2020 earnings per share multiples ranging from 10.0x to 20.0x and price to
December 31, 2020 tangible book value per share multiples ranging from 100% to 225%. The terminal values were then discounted to
present values using different discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 15.0% which were chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding
required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of MBRG common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the analysis
indicated an imputed range of values per share of MBRG common stock of $12.74 to $29.79 when applying multiples of earnings per
share and $14.03 to $36.93 when applying multiples of tangible book value per share.

Sandler O’Neill also considered and discussed with the MBRG board of directors how this analysis would be affected by changes
in the underlying assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Sandler O’Neill performed a
similar analysis assuming MBRG’s net income varied from 25% above projections to 25% below projections. This analysis resulted in
the following range of per share values for MBRG common stock, applying the price to 2020 earnings per share multiples range of
10.0x to 20.0x referred to above and a discount rate of 12.05%.

Sandler O’Neill noted that the net present value analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such
methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous assumptions that must be made, and the results thereof are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or future results.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis. Sandler O’Neill analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger, assuming the merger
closes at the end of the first calendar quarter of 2017. In performing this analysis, Sandler O’Neill utilized the following information:
(i) financial projections for MBRG for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 and estimated long-term annual
earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions as provided by the respective senior managements of MBRG and ANCX; (ii)
mean publicly available analyst estimates for ANCX for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31,
2018 as well as estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions as provided by the senior
management of ANCX; and (iii) certain assumptions relating to purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and transaction
expenses, as provided by the senior management of ANCX. The analysis indicated that the merger could be accretive to ANCX’s
earnings per share (excluding one-time transaction costs and expenses) in the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and
December 31, 2019, neutral to ANCX’s estimated tangible book value per share at close and accretive to ANCX’s estimated tangible
book value per share at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.

In connection with this analysis, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the MBRG board of directors how the analysis
would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions, including the impact of final purchase accounting adjustments determined
at the closing of the transaction, and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results
and the variations may be material.

Sandler O’Neill’s Relationship. Sandler O’Neill has acted as MBRG’s financial advisor in connection with the merger and will
receive a fee for its services estimated to be approximately $3.05 million based on the market value of Access’s common stock at the
time the merger was announced. The fee is equal to 1.25% of the aggregate purchase price, will vary based on the market value of
Access’ common stock at the time of closing and is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Sandler O’Neill also received a
$500,000 fee upon rendering its fairness opinion to the MBRG board of directors, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the
transaction fee which will become payable to Sandler O’Neill on the day of closing of the merger. MBRG has also agreed to indemnify
Sandler O’Neill against certain claims and liabilities arising out of its engagement and to reimburse Sandler O’Neill for certain of its
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement. In connection with its engagement, Sandler O’Neill was not asked
to, and did not, solicit indications of interest in a potential transaction with MBRG from other parties.

In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, Sandler O’Neill provided certain other investment banking services to MBRG
and received fees for such services. Earlier in 2016, Sandler O’Neill was engaged as MBRG’s financial advisor in connection with
MBRG’s strategic defense planning and its board of directors’ consideration of alternative strategies. Sandler O’Neill has not provided
any investment banking services to ANCX in the two years preceding the date of its opinion. In the ordinary course of its business as a
broker-dealer, Sandler O’Neill may purchase securities from and sell securities to MBRG and its affiliates. Sandler O’Neill may also
actively trade the equity and debt securities of MBRG, ANCX and their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of
its customers.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Access and Middleburg do not as a matter of course make public projections as to future revenues, earnings, financial condition
or other results. However, the management of Middleburg and Access prepared the Middleburg Financial Forecasts and the Adjusted
Middleburg Financial Forecasts, respectively (collectively, the “Financial Forecasts”), to present certain unaudited prospective
financial information regarding Middleburg’s future operations for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, with linear
extrapolations therefrom. The Financial Forecasts were made available to each party and to their respective financial advisors in
connection with the merger. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in the joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as
an admission that any of Access, Middleburg, FBR or Sandler O’Neill considered, or now considers, the Financial Forecasts to be
necessarily predictive of actual future results, or that the Financial Forecasts should be construed as financial guidance, and the
Financial Forecasts should not be relied upon as such.

The Financial Forecasts were prepared for internal use only and are subjective in many respects. The Financial Forecasts were not
prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP, the rules or published guidelines of the
SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial
information, but, in the view of Access’s management and Middleburg’s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflect the
best available estimates and judgments at the time they were prepared, and present expected future financial performance to the best of
Access’s management’s and Middleburg’s management’s respective knowledge and belief when prepared. However, this prospective
financial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results.

Neither Access’s or Middleburg’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or
performed any procedures with respect to the Financial Forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance
on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial
information.

The Financial Forecasts reflect numerous estimates and assumptions made with respect to business, economic, market,
competition, regulatory and financial conditions and matters specific to the business of Middleburg and Access, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Middleburg and Access. The Financial Forecasts reflect assumptions
as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus are susceptible to
multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. Access and Middleburg can give
no assurance that the Financial Forecasts and the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, because the
Financial Forecasts cover multiple years, the information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Actual
results may differ materially from those set forth below, and important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Financial
Forecasts not to be realized include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the business of Access or Middleburg,
industry performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition and adverse changes in
applicable laws, regulations or policies. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ are further described in the sections of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Risk Factors,” “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Where
You Can Find More Information” beginning on pages 28, 34 and 108 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Shareholders of each of
Access and Middleburg are urged to review Access’s and Middleburg’s most recent SEC filings for a description of risk factors with
respect to the business of Access and Middleburg, respectively.

Furthermore, the Financial Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were
prepared. Access and Middleburg can give no assurance that, had the Financial Forecasts been prepared as of the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, similar estimates and assumptions would be used. Access and Middleburg do not intend to, and disclaim
any obligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision to the Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing since
their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are
shown to be in error, or to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. The Financial Forecasts do not take into account
all possible financial and other effects on either Access or Middleburg, as applicable, of the merger and do not attempt to predict or
suggest future results of the combined company. The Financial Forecasts do not give effect to the impact of negotiating or executing
the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, all potential synergies that may
be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been
or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions
that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated,
postponed

or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Financial Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any possible failure of
the merger to occur. None of Access, Middleburg or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors including FBR and Sandler
O’Neill, or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any shareholder of
Access or Middleburg, or any other person, regarding actual performance compared to the information contained in the Financial
Forecasts or that projected results will be achieved. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts should not be deemed an admission or
representation by Access or Middleburg that it is viewed as material information of Access or Middleburg, particularly in light of the
inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such Financial Forecasts. The summary of the Financial Forecasts included below is
not being included to influence your decision whether to vote for the Access merger proposal or the Middleburg merger proposal, as
applicable, nor should the Financial Forecasts be construed as financial guidance, and they should not be relied on as such.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Access and Middleburg special meetings will be held several months after the
Financial Forecasts were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, shareholders of Access and
Middleburg are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on such information in connection with their consideration of the merger.

The following table presents selected unaudited prospective financial data constituting the Financial Forecasts for the periods
presented.

Interests of Certain Middleburg Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendations of the Middleburg board of directors that Middleburg shareholders vote in favor of the
Middleburg merger proposal and the compensation proposal, Middleburg shareholders should be aware that Middleburg directors and
executive officers may have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as shareholders of Middleburg.
The Middleburg board of directors was aware of these interests and took them into account in its decision to approve the merger
agreement and the merger.

Indemnification and Insurance. Access has agreed to indemnify the officers and directors of Middleburg against certain
liabilities arising before the effective date of the merger. Access has also agreed to purchase a six year “tail” prepaid policy, on the
same terms as Middleburg’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, for the current officers and directors of Middleburg,
subject to a cap on the cost of such policy equal to 300% of Middleburg’s current annual premium.

Director Appointments. At the effective date of the merger, six current directors of Middleburg, John C. Lee, IV, Childs F.
Burden, Gary D. LeClair, Mary Leigh McDaniel, Janet A. Neuharth, and Gary R. Shook, will become directors of Access. John C. Lee,
IV, current chairman of Middleburg’s board of directors, will serve as chairman of Access’ board of directors. Michael G. Anzilotti,
Access’ current chairman of the board of directors, will serve as vice chairman; and the executive committee of the Access board of
directors shall be Mr. Anzilotti, Martin S. Friedman, Michael W. Clarke, Mr. Lee, IV, and Mr. Shook. The executive officers of Access
will continue serving in their current positions as executive officers of Access after the merger, and Messrs. Shook, Jeffrey H. Culver
and David L. Hartley will also serve as executive officers of Access after the merger as follows: Mr. Shook will serve as Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Middleburg Investment Group, Inc., Chairman of Middleburg Trust Company, and President of Middleburg
Bank, a division of Access National

Bank; Mr. Culver will serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Access National Bank; and Mr. Hartley will
serve as President of Middleburg Investment Group, Inc. and President and Chief Executive officer of Middleburg Trust Company.
Each director of Access following the merger will also serve as a director of Access National Bank.

Access pays non-employee directors a basic cash retainer on a quarterly or monthly basis that is designed to compensate directors
for their participation on the Access board of directors and the execution of their basic duties and responsibilities. Access’
compensation committee also conducts an annual evaluation of performance under criteria similar to the criteria used for its executive
cash bonuses for payment of annual incentives to Access directors. Incentives are paid in cash, option awards or some combination
thereof. Non-employee members of the board of directors of Access currently receive a basic retainer of $36,000 each, and the
chairman of the Access board of directors receives an additional retainer of $12,000, in each case payable monthly. During the first
quarter of 2017, Access’s Compensation Committee expects to evaluate director performance for incentive awards in connection with
2016 performance and set basic director compensation for 2017. Access’s directors do not currently receive any additional
compensation for service on the board of directors of any subsidiary of Access, or on any committee of the board of directors of Access
or any of its subsidiaries.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards. Middleburg has awarded certain employees, officers and directors stock options and
grants of restricted stock pursuant to its equity compensation plans. As of the record date for the Middleburg special meeting, the
Middleburg directors and executive officers held, in the aggregate, options to purchase 12,085 shares of Middleburg common stock
granted under Middleburg’s equity compensation plans. To the extent the options have not been exercised, at the effective date of the
merger, each option to purchase shares of Middleburg common stock granted under a Middleburg equity compensation plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will be cancelled for a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the
difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of
the merger and the per share exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) the number of shares of Middleburg common stock subject to
such stock option.

For each Middleburg named executive officer, the cash payments for cancellation of stock options in connection with the merger
is set forth in the table below entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation,” which assumes the merger was completed on January 15,
2017 and assumes a price per share of Middleburg common stock of $30.38 (which is the average closing market price of Middleburg
common stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the merger). Using the same assumptions,
Middleburg’s other executive officers as a group will receive cash payments for cancellation of stock options in connection with the
merger of approximately $32,957 in the aggregate. Middleburg’s non-employee directors do not hold stock options.

Each restricted share of Middleburg common stock granted under a Middleburg equity compensation plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will, pursuant to the terms of each such grant, vest in full immediately prior to the
effective date of the merger and be converted into unrestricted shares of Access common stock based on the merger’s exchange ratio.

For each Middleburg named executive officer, the value of the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in connection with the
merger is set forth in the table below entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation,” which assumes a value of $30.38 per each unvested
share of common stock (which is the average closing market price of Middleburg common stock over the first five business days
following the first public announcement of the merger) and assumes the merger was completed on January 15, 2017. Using the same
assumptions, the value of the accelerated vesting of restricted stock for Middleburg’s other executive officers as a group is
approximately $534,688 in the aggregate. Non-employee directors do not hold restricted stock that will vest in connection with the
merger. Certain shares of restricted stock, described in this paragraph and shown in the table below to reflect accelerated vesting
assuming the merger was completed on January 15, 2017, may vest in accordance with their terms after January 15, 2017 but prior to
the completion of the merger (which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017).

Employee Benefit Plans. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the merger, employees of Middleburg or its
subsidiaries (including Middleburg Bank) who continue on as employees of Access or its subsidiaries (including Access National
Bank) will be entitled to participate in the health and welfare benefit and similar plans of Access or its subsidiaries on the same terms
and conditions as employees of Access and its subsidiaries. Participation by former employees of Middleburg and its subsidiaries in the
combined company’s benefit plans may commence at different times with respect to each benefit plan until such time as the full
complement of benefits of the combined company are legally or practically available to said employees. Subject to certain exceptions,
these employees will receive credit for their years of service to Middleburg or Middleburg Bank for participation, vesting and benefit
accrual purposes.

Change of Control Payments under Current Middleburg Employment Agreements. Middleburg has written employment
agreements with each of Messrs. Shook, Culver, Hartley and Mehra. These employment agreements provide, in relevant part, that if the
officer’s employment is terminated by Middleburg without “cause” or by the officer for “good reason” within one year of a “change of
control,” then Middleburg shall pay amounts to the officers as follows: (i) pursuant to Mr. Shook’s employment agreement, a cash
amount equal to 300% of his highest cash compensation earned after 2009, (ii) pursuant to Mr. Culver’s employment agreement, a cash
amount equal to 200% of his highest cash compensation earned after 2008, and (iii) pursuant to Mr. Mehra’s employment agreement, a
cash amount equal to 200% of his highest cash compensation earned after 2009. Pursuant to Mr. Hartley’s employment agreement,
upon his termination, regardless of whether or not the termination occurs following a “change of control,” a cash amount equal to
200% of his current salary will be paid by Middleburg. Payment of these amounts is subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the
Code which may require that disbursement of benefits be postponed for six months from the date of termination. In addition,
compensation to each of Messrs. Shook, Culver, Hartley and Mehra related to the change of control will be reduced as necessary to
avoid any “excess parachute payment” as defined by Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code. If Mr. Shook, Mr. Culver, Mr.
Hartley or Mr. Mehra breach any of the covenants in their respective agreements related to the protection of confidential information,
non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation, or is terminated “for cause” as defined in the employment agreement, he is not
entitled to any further compensation.

Under the Shook, Culver, Hartley and Mehra employment agreements, a change of control is a significant change of the
ownership, management or assets of Middleburg that fits into one of these categories: (i) a person or group of persons acting together
becomes the beneficial owner of Middleburg securities having at least 50% of the combined voting power of the Middleburg securities
that may be voted in an election of Middleburg’s directors, other than as a result of certain issuances or repurchases of securities
initiated by Middleburg; (ii) as a result of or in connection with a tender or exchange offer, a merger or other business combination, a
sale of assets, a contested election of directors, or any combination of these events, the persons who were the directors of Middleburg
before such events cease to constitute a majority of Middleburg’s board of directors or any successor’s board, within two years of the
last of such events. The merger will constitute a change of control for purposes of these agreements. The employment agreements also
provide for payment of specified severance compensation in the event that the executive is terminated without “cause” or resigns for
“good reason,” each as defined in the employment agreements, and in any such case the executive is subject to noncompetition
covenants for twelve months following termination and nonsolicitation covenants for 24 months following termination.

Simultaneous with the effectiveness of the merger, Middleburg will terminate the employment agreements of Messrs. Shook,
Culver and Hartley and pay to each benefits that would be provided thereunder in the event of termination without “cause” or a
resignation by the executive for “good reason” (in the case of Messrs. Shook and Culver, which occurs within one year after a change
of control), and each of Messrs. Shook, Culver and Hartley will execute a general release of claims. As described in more detail below,
in addition to payment of benefits provided under the employment agreements of Messrs. Shook, Culver and Hartley, Access,
Middleburg and certain of their respective subsidiaries have entered into agreements for employment following the merger with
Messrs. Shook, Culver and Hartley.

Simultaneous with the effectiveness of the merger, (i) Middleburg will terminate the employment agreement of Mr. Mehra and
pay to him the benefits provided thereunder in the event of termination without “cause” within one year after a change of control, and
(ii) Middleburg will terminate Mr. Mehra’s employment. In connection therewith Mr. Mehra will execute a separation agreement and
general release that provides (a) Mr. Mehra will receive a lump sum payment of $100, and (b) Mr. Mehra agrees to customary
confidentiality covenants and further agrees to release and waive any and all claims against Access, Middleburg and their respective
affiliates and subsidiaries, among other parties.

Payments and Benefits to Middleburg Named Executive Officers. The following table sets forth the information required by
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC regarding certain compensation which Middleburg named executive officers
may receive that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger. The amounts are calculated assuming that the effective date of the
merger and a qualifying termination of employment occurred on January 15, 2017. The merger-related compensation payable to the
Middleburg named executive officers is the subject of a non-binding advisory vote of Middleburg shareholders, as described under
“Proposals to be Considered at the Middleburg Special Meeting — Approval of the Compensation Proposal (Middleburg Proposal No.
2)” beginning on page 43.

* This table assumes the merger was completed on January 15, 2017, and that all required conditions to the payment of these

amounts have been satisfied.
(1) Represents estimated cash payments payable under the named executive officers’ employment agreements upon a termination

without cause or for good reason within one year of a “change of control” (double-trigger) in the case of Messrs. Shook, Mehra
and Culver, and upon a termination without cause or for good reason in the case of Mr. Hartley. The merger agreement provides
that Middleburg will terminate these employment agreements and, on the ninetieth day following closing of the merger, Access
will make lump sum cash payments to the named executive officers in the amounts provided pursuant to the foregoing provisions,
in each case subject to reduction as needed so that no cash or other compensation would constitute an “excess parachute
payment,” causing the executive to be subject to an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The value of the
accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards, as determined for this purpose under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code and
described in note 2 below, is compensation that will be taken into account in determining any such reduction in cash payments.

(2) Represents single-trigger accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards that are unvested at the time the merger closes and
assuming a value of $30.38 per each unvested share of common stock (which is the average closing market price of Middleburg
common stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the merger). The values shown are
different from – and significantly higher than – the valuation of the accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted stock awards for
purposes of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code, which valuation is determined as of the merger date and is based on several
factors, including the stock’s fair market value and, where vesting would have occurred based on continued service, the length of
time until the unvested equity grants would otherwise have vested absent the change in control.

(3) Represents single-trigger accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards that are unvested at the time the merger closes and
payment in cancellation of stock options outstanding at the time the merger closes. The aggregate dollar value related to the
accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards of $470,890 for Mr. Mehra and $908,362 for Mr. Culver assumes a value of $30.38
per each unvested share of common stock (which is the average closing market price of Middleburg common stock over the first
five business days following the first public announcement of the merger). The aggregate dollar value related to payment in
cancellation of outstanding stock options of $81,900 for Mr. Mehra and $83,096 for Mr. Culver represents the difference between
$30.38 (which is the average closing market price of Middleburg common stock over the first five business days following the
first public announcement of the merger) and the exercise price for each outstanding stock option that is cancelled as a result of
the merger. Importantly, these values are different from –and significantly higher than – the valuation of unvested equity grants
for purposes of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code, which valuation is determined as of the date of the change in control and is
based on several factors, including the stock’s fair market value and the length of time until the unvested equity grants would
otherwise have vested, assuming no change in control.

(4) Subject to reduction for Messrs. Shook, Culver and Mehra, as described below.

If the payments or benefits received or to be received by Messrs. Shook, Mehra, Culver or Hartley would constitute an “excess
parachute payment,” thereby causing the executive to be subject to an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, then the
total benefits paid to such executive will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of any such excise taxes. Any reduction
is taken first from cash compensation, then from equity compensation or accelerated vesting on a pro-rata basis. Assuming the merger
closed on January 15, 2017, the maximum amount that could be paid without causing Messrs. Shook, Culver, and Mehra to be subject
to the excise tax described above is estimated as follows: Mr. Shook, $1,705,945, and Mr. Culver, $1,147,513, and Mr. Mehra,
$885,019. As a result, Mr. Shook’s payments and benefits would be reduced to $1,705,945, Mr. Culver’s payments and benefits would
be reduced to $1,147,513, and Mr. Mehra’s payments and benefits would be reduced to $885,019, in each case to avoid imposition of
the excise tax described above. Assuming the merger closed on January 15, 2017, the value of the payments and benefits received by
Messrs. Mehra, Hartley and McLean, as calculated for purposes of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code in connection with the merger,
would be below their respective Section 280G limits, such that no reductions would be necessary to avoid the imposition of the excise
tax described above.

Bank, Middleburg Investment Group, Inc. and/or Middleburg Trust Company have entered into new employment agreements to be
effective upon completion of the merger with Gary R. Shook, Jeffrey H. Culver and David L. Hartley, as applicable, each of whom is
currently a named executive officer of Middleburg.

Access Employment Agreement with Mr. Shook. Access National Bank, Middleburg Investment Group, Inc. and Middleburg
Trust Company entered into an employment agreement, dated as of October 21, 2016, with Mr. Shook to serve as chairman and chief
executive officer of Middleburg Investment Group, Inc., chairman of Middleburg Trust Company and as the president of the
Middleburg Bank, an operating division of Access National Bank. The employment agreement, which will become effective upon the
closing of the merger, will have a term that expires on the third anniversary of the closing of the merger. The agreement may be
extended upon mutual agreement of the parties thereto, for single one-year terms, commencing only on the third and fourth
anniversaries of the effectiveness of the merger. The agreement cannot be renewed past the fifth anniversary of the closing of the
merger. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of $400,000. Under the agreement, Mr. Shook is eligible to
receive an annual bonus of up to $80,000 in cash or other form of compensation as mutually agreed and an annual award of stock
options to acquire shares of Access common stock in an amount up to 3,500 shares issued at market that have an exercise price at least
equal to the fair market value of a share of Access common stock on the date of grant and shall vest and be exercisable in accordance
with the Access stock option plan, the exact number of shares granted under a stock option to be determined by the Access board in its
discretion only if Mr. Shook earns an annual bonus. The agreement also provides for certain benefits including a monthly automobile
allowance, payment of monthly country club dues, a cellular telephone allowance and group term life insurance and split dollar life
insurance. Finally, Mr. Shook must maintain an ownership position in Access common stock in an amount no less than the lesser of
$750,000 or 50,000 shares during the term of the agreement.

If Access terminates Mr. Shook’s employment without “cause” or if he resigns for “good reason,” then Mr. Shook will, subject to
his execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims, be entitled to continue to receive: (i) if the termination occurs prior to
the first anniversary of the effectiveness of the agreement, six months of his base salary in effect at the time of termination, plus 50% of
the target annual incentive for the year of the termination; or (ii) if the termination occurs after the first anniversary of the effectiveness
of the agreement, but not in connection with the expiration or non-renewal of the initial term or any renewal term of the agreement, two
weeks of base salary in effect at the date of termination per year of service (allowing credit for Mr. Shook’s years of service at
Middleburg), which will be capped at 26 weeks, with any severance payment related to (i) or (ii) to be paid over a six-month period in
equal installments in accordance with Access National Bank’s normal payroll; or (iii) if termination occurs upon the expiration or non-
renewal of the initial term or any renewal term of the agreement, one year of Mr. Shook’s base salary in effect at the date of the
expiration or non-renewal, such severance payment to be payable over a 12-month period in equal installments in accordance with the
normal payroll of Access National Bank. Mr. Shook is subject to a one year covenant not to compete and a two year covenant not to
solicit customers or employees following the termination of his employment for any reason.

Under the employment agreement, termination for cause means termination for: (i) Mr. Shook’s willful misconduct in connection
with the performance of his duties; (ii) Mr. Shook’s misappropriation or embezzlement of funds or material property of Access
National Bank or any affiliate; (iii) Mr. Shook’s fraud or dishonesty with respect to Access National Bank or any affiliate; (iv) Mr.
Shook’s failure to perform any of the material duties and responsibilities required by his position, or his failure to follow reasonable
instructions or policies of Access National Bank, in either case after being advised in writing of such failure and being given a
reasonable opportunity and period to remedy such failure, which period shall not be less than 30 days; (v) Mr. Shook’s conviction of,
indictment for, or entering of a guilty plea or plea of no contest with respect to any felony or any misdemeanor involving moral
turpitude; (vi) Mr. Shook’s breach of a material term of the agreement, or violation in any material respect of any policy, code or
standard of behavior generally applicable to officers of Access National Bank, after being advised in writing of such breach or
violation and being given a reasonable opportunity and period to remedy such breach or violation, which period shall not be less than
30 days; (vii) Mr. Shook’s breach of any fiduciary duty owed to Access National Bank or its affiliates; or (viii) Mr. Shook’s engaging
in conduct that, if it became known by any regulatory of governmental agency or the public, would be or is reasonably likely to result,
in the good faith judgment of the Bank, in material injury to the Bank, monetarily or otherwise.

Termination by Mr. Shook for good reason under the employment agreement means termination for: (i) a material reduction in
Mr. Shook’s base salary or not allowing Mr. Shook to participate in any incentive compensation plan in the same manner as other
management personnel who are similarly situated; (ii) a permanent demotion of Mr. Shook and diminution in duties that requires Mr.
Shook to perform continued duties materially inconsistent with his position, authority,

duties or responsibilities as contemplated by the agreement; (iii) the relocation of Mr. Shook to any other primary place of employment
more than 75 miles from his primary place of employment in Middleburg, Virginia as of the date of the agreement, without Mr.
Shook’s express written consent to such location; or (iv) a material breach of the agreement by Access National Bank.

In the event of a change of control of Access, if Mr. Shook’s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause within one
year of the change of control or he resigns for good reason within one year of a change of control, then subject to his execution,
delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims, Access National Bank will pay Mr. Shook severance in the amount of one year of
base salary as in effect on the date of termination, payable over a 12-month period in equal installments in accordance with the Bank’s
normal payroll, subject to the limitation that no payment shall constitute an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code.

Access Employment Agreement with Jeffrey H. Culver. Access National Bank has entered into an employment agreement, dated
as of October 21, 2016, with Mr. Culver to serve as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Access National Bank.
Similar to Mr. Shook’s agreement, the employment agreement, which will become effective upon the closing of the merger, will have a
term that expires on the third anniversary of the closing of the merger. The agreement may be extended upon mutual agreement of the
parties thereto, for single one-year terms, commencing only on the third and fourth anniversaries of the effectiveness of the merger. The
agreement cannot be renewed past the fifth anniversary of the closing of the merger. The employment agreement provides for an
annual base salary of $320,000. Under the agreement, Mr. Culver is eligible to receive an annual bonus of up to 25% of his salary in
cash or other form of compensation as mutually agreed and an annual award of stock options of Access in an amount up to 3,500
shares issued at market that have an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of a share of Access common stock on the date
of grant and shall vest and be exercisable in accordance with the Access stock option plan, the exact number of shares granted under a
stock option to be determined by the Access board in its discretion only if Mr. Culver earns an annual bonus. The agreement also
provides for certain benefits including a monthly automobile allowance, a cellular telephone allowance and group term life insurance
and split dollar life insurance. Finally, Mr. Culver must maintain an ownership position in Access common stock in an amount no less
than the lesser of $750,000 or 50,000 shares during the term of the agreement.

With respect to the provisions in Mr. Culver’s agreement related to the termination of Mr. Culver’s employment without “cause”
or his resignation for “good reason,” the terms of Mr. Culver’s agreement are identical to those of Mr. Shook’s agreement detailed
above. Likewise, the provisions of Mr. Culver’s agreement related to his termination or resignation following a change of control are
also identical to those of Mr. Shook’s agreement.

Interests of Certain Shareholders in the Merger

Access and Middleburg entered into a voting and standstill agreement with David L. Sokol and the David L. Sokol Revocable
Trust simultaneous with entry into the merger agreement. For a description of the voting commitments and limits on certain
transactions under the voting and standstill agreement, see “The Merger Agreement – Voting and Standstill Agreement.” Pursuant to
the voting and standstill agreement, at the effective date of the merger, Access will reimburse Mr. Sokol and the trust for his out-of-
pocket fees, costs and expenses up to $500,000 incurred beginning March 30, 2016 in connection with analyses, communications,
disclosures and engagement made with or with respect to Middleburg, Access, their respective boards of directors, by Mr. Sokol or his
affiliates or representatives, including but not limited to legal and financial advisor fees. In addition, Middleburg and Access agreed to
indemnify Mr. Sokol and his representatives before and until the merger, and from and after the merger, respectively, to the maximum
extent possible under applicable law in connection with the merger and the merger agreement, in each case except to the extent relating
to any willful misconduct, actual fraud or criminal conduct of Mr. Sokol and his representatives.

Regulatory Approvals

Access and Middleburg cannot complete the merger without prior approval from the Federal Reserve and the Virginia SCC, and
cannot complete the subsidiary bank merger without prior approval from the OCC. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Access has filed the required applications with the Federal Reserve and the Virginia SCC seeking approval of the
merger, and with the OCC seeking approval of the subsidiary bank merger, but we have not yet

received the required approvals. While we do not know of any reason why we would not be able to obtain the necessary approvals in a
timely manner, we cannot be certain when or if we will receive them.

Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights in the Merger

Under Virginia law, the shareholders of Access and Middleburg are not entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights in connection
with the merger.

Certain Differences in Rights of Shareholders

Access and Middleburg are Virginia corporations governed by the Virginia SCA. In addition, the rights of Access and Middleburg
shareholders are governed by their respective articles of incorporation and bylaws. Upon completion of the merger, Middleburg
shareholders will become shareholders of Access, and as such their shareholder rights will then be governed by the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Access, each as amended, and by the Virginia SCA. The rights of shareholders of Access differ in certain
respects from the rights of shareholders of Middleburg.

A summary of the material differences between the rights of a Middleburg shareholder under the Virginia SCA and Middleburg’s
articles of incorporation and bylaws, on the one hand, and the rights of an Access shareholder under the Virginia SCA and the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of Access, on the other hand, is provided in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section
“Comparative Rights of Shareholders” on page 98.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to generally accepted accounting
principles in the U.S., or “GAAP.” Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities, including identifiable
intangible assets arising from the transaction, of Middleburg will be recorded, as of completion of the merger, at their respective fair
values and added to those of Access. Any excess of purchase price over the fair values is recorded as goodwill. Financial statements
and reported results of operations of Access issued after completion of the merger will reflect these values, but will not be restated
retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Middleburg. See also “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information” beginning on page 19.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary description of the material provisions of the merger agreement. The following description of the
merger agreement is subject to and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read the merger agreement in its entirety as
it is the legal document governing the merger.

Terms of the Merger

The Access board of directors and the Middleburg board of directors have each approved the merger agreement, which provides
for the merger of Middleburg with and into Access. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, as a result of the merger, each share
of Middleburg common stock issued and outstanding before the merger will be converted into the right to receive 1.3314 shares of
Access common stock, which we have defined as the “exchange ratio” for the purposes of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If the
outstanding shares of Access common stock or Middleburg common stock are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of securities as a result of a reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in
capitalization, then a proportionate adjustment will be made to the exchange ratio.

After the merger, Middleburg Bank, the bank subsidiary of Middleburg, will merge with and into Access National Bank, the bank
subsidiary of Access. Access National Bank will be the surviving bank in the subsidiary bank merger. Access and Middleburg expect to
complete the bank merger during the second quarter of 2017.

Effective Date; Closing

The effective date of the merger will be the effective date and time set forth in the articles of merger that Access and Middleburg
will file with the Virginia SCC. We anticipate that we will complete the merger during the second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt
of required shareholder approvals and all required regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set
forth in the merger agreement. See “– Conditions to Completion of the Merger” at page 81.

There can be no assurances as to if or when the shareholder and regulatory approvals will be obtained or continued or that the
merger will be completed. If we do not complete the merger by September 30, 2017, either party may terminate the merger agreement,
provided that such termination right is not available to a party whose action or inaction has been the cause of or resulted in the failure
of the merger to occur on or before such date and such action or inaction constitutes a breach of the merger agreement.

Merger Consideration

General. In the proposed merger, holders of Middleburg common stock will receive 1.3314 shares of common stock of Access for
each of their shares of Middleburg common stock outstanding on the effective date of the merger. This exchange ratio is fixed and will
not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the merger. Based on the average closing price of Access’s
common stock for the twenty trading days ended October 21, 2016 ($24.42), the 1.3314 exchange ratio represented approximately
$32.51 in value for each share of Middleburg common stock or $233.1 million in the aggregate. Based on the average closing price of
Access’s common stock for the twenty trading days ended January 31, 2017, the last trading day before the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the 1.3314 exchange ratio represented approximately $37.02 in value for each share of Middleburg common
stock or $266.8 million in the aggregate.

Access’s shareholders will continue to own their existing shares of Access common stock. Each share of Access common stock
will continue to represent one share of common stock of Access following the merger.

Fractional Shares. Access will not issue any fractional shares of common stock. Instead, a Middleburg shareholder who would
otherwise have received a fraction of a share will receive an amount of cash equal to the fraction of a share of Access common stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the closing sale price of Access common stock on the NASDAQ Global
Market on the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of the merger.

Treatment of Middleburg Restricted Stock Awards and Stock Options

Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to acquire Middleburg common stock, whether or not
vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire Middleburg common stock and shall be converted into the right to receive a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of:
 

 
•  the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the trading

day immediately preceding the effective date of the merger and the per share exercise price of such Middleburg stock option
immediately prior to the effective date of the merger; and

 

 •  the number of shares of Middleburg common stock subject to such Middleburg stock option.

If the exercise price of a Middleburg stock option immediately prior to the effective date of the merger is greater than the closing
sale price of Middleburg common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the trading day immediately preceding the effective date
of the merger, then in the proposed merger such option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange therefor.

Each Middleburg restricted stock award which is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date
of the merger shall, pursuant to the terms of each such award, vest in full immediately prior to the merger and shall be converted into
the right to receive unrestricted shares of Access common stock based on the exchange ratio, and the shares of Middleburg common
stock subject to such Middleburg restricted stock awards shall be treated in the same manner as all other shares of Middleburg common
stock.

Exchange of Stock in the Merger

Access Common Stock. Each share of Access common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective date of the
merger will remain issued and outstanding immediately after completion of the merger as a share of common stock of Access. As a
result, there is no need for Access shareholder to take any action as a result of the completion of the merger, including submitting any
certificates representing shares of Access common stock to Access, the exchange agent or any other person in connection with the
merger.

Middleburg Common Stock. At the effective date of the merger, Access will deposit with the exchange agent cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Access common stock that would otherwise be issued in the
merger, and will authorize and direct issuance by the exchange agent of shares of Access common stock represented by book-entry
registry, in each case for the benefit of the holders of Middleburg common stock.

Within five business days after the completion of the merger, the exchange agent will send transmittal materials to each holder of
Middleburg common stock for use in exchanging such Middleburg common stock for shares of Access common stock, and cash
instead of fractional shares, if applicable. Such transmittal materials shall permit each holder of Middleburg common stock to elect to
receive, in lieu of shares of Access common stock represented by book-entry registry, a stock certificate representing shares of Access
common stock.

Middleburg stock certificates should NOT be returned with the enclosed proxy card, and should NOT be forwarded to the
exchange agent until you receive a transmittal letter following completion of the merger. Until you exchange your shares of
Middleburg common stock for shares of Access common stock, you will not receive any dividends or distributions in respect of shares
of Access common stock. Once you exchange your shares of Middleburg common stock for shares of Access common stock, you will
receive, without interest, the merger consideration and all undelivered dividends or distributions with a record date after the effective
date of the merger.

If you own Middleburg common stock through a broker, bank or other holder of record, you will not need to obtain a certificate to
represent shares of Middleburg common stock to deliver it to the exchange agent to exchange for the merger consideration.

If your Middleburg common stock certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen or is otherwise missing, Access and the exchange
agent may require you to make an affidavit of that fact and to post a bond in a reasonable amount as an indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Access with respect to the lost, destroyed, stolen or otherwise missing Middleburg common stock certificate.

Corporate Governance

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of Access as in effect immediately prior to the
merger will be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Access after the merger.

Board of Directors of Access. Access will, on or prior to the effective date, cause the number of directors that will comprise the
full board of directors of Access at the effective date of the merger to be fixed at thirteen, consisting of (i) seven current directors of
Access designated by Access, including the current Chief Executive Officer of Access (or the “Access Directors”), and (ii) six directors
of Middleburg to be identified by Access and Middleburg prior to the effective date of the merger (or the “Middleburg Directors”). The
Access Directors and the Middleburg Directors will be split among the three classes of directors on the Access board of directors to
serve staggered terms. Provided that each Middleburg Director continues to meet the standards for directors of Access, Access shall
nominate each Middleburg Director for reelection to the Access board of directors at the first annual meeting of Access’s shareholders
following the effective date of the merger, and Access’s proxy materials with respect to such meeting of Access’s shareholders will
include the recommendation of the Access board of directors that shareholders of Access vote to reelect each Middleburg Director.

After the merger, (i) Mr. John C. Lee, IV, current Chairman of the Middleburg board of directors, shall serve as Chairman of the
Access board of directors, (ii) Mr. Michael G. Anzilotti, current Chairman of the Access board of directors, shall serve as Vice
Chairman of the Access board of directors, and (iii) the members of the Executive Committee of the Access board of directors shall be
Mr. Lee, IV, Mr. Anzilotti, Mr. Shook, Mr. Martin S. Friedman, and Mr. Michael W. Clarke, current President and Chief Executive
Officer of Access.

Officers of Access. The executive officers of Access immediately prior to the merger will continue serving in their current
positions as executive officers of Access after the merger, and Mr. Shook and Jeffrey H. Culver will also serve as officers of Access
after the Merger as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Middleburg Investment Group and Chairman of Middleburg Trust
Company, and as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively.

Corporate Governance of Access National Bank and Middleburg Bank. After the merger, Middleburg Bank, the bank
subsidiary of Middleburg, will merge with and into Access National Bank, the bank subsidiary of Access. Access National Bank will
be the surviving bank in the subsidiary bank merger. Access and Middleburg expect to complete the bank merger during the second
quarter of 2017. After the merger of Middleburg into Access, each director of Access, in addition to Mark Moore, President of Access
National Bank, will serve as a director of Access National Bank and as a director of Middleburg Bank, and executive officers of Access
National Bank will continue serving in their current positions as officers of Access National Bank. After the merger, Mr. Shook and
Mr. Culver will also serve as officers of Access National Bank as President of Middleburg Bank, an operating division of Access
National Bank, and as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, and all executive officers of Access National
Bank will serve in substantially similar positions as officers of Middleburg Bank.

After the merger, Mr. Moore, 53, will continue to serve as President of Access National Bank. Mr. Moore was appointed as
President of Access National Bank in June 2016, and from April 2008 to May 2016 he served as Executive Vice President and Chief
Lending Officer of John Marshall Bank. Prior to joining John Marshall Bank, Mr. Moore was a Senior Relationship Manager and
Director in the corporate banking department of M&T Bank, and previously was President and Principal of Longstreet Capital
Partners, Inc., a registered broker-dealer, a Principal in Longstreet Partners, LLC, a boutique investment banking firm, and a Principal

or executive officers. Mr. Moore does not have any material interest in any transactions, relationships or arrangements with Access that
would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The representations described above and included in the merger agreement were made for purposes of the merger agreement and
are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement.
In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date and may be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from what might be viewed as material to shareholders. The representations and warranties and other provisions of
the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should only be read together with the information provided elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by Access
and Middleburg, and in the periodic and current reports and statements that Access and Middleburg each file with the SEC. See “Where

respectively;

Table of Contents

 
•  the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the merger agreement, subject to the material adverse

effect standard in the merger agreement;
 

 •  the other party’s performance in all material respects of its obligations under the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the receipt by Access from Troutman Sanders LLP, Access’s outside legal counsel, and the receipt by Middleburg from

Williams Mullen, Middleburg’s outside legal counsel, of written legal opinions to the effect that the merger will be treated as
a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and

 

 
•  the effectiveness of employment agreements with respect to employment after the merger between Access or certain of its

subsidiaries and Messrs. Shook, Culver and Hartley.

In addition, Access’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to Middleburg having minimum tangible equity of
$124,000,000 and Middleburg’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to Access having minimum tangible equity of
$120,500,000, in each case as of the last day of the month ended prior to the effective date of the merger. The merger agreement
defines each party’s tangible equity as total shareholders’ equity excluding intangible assets and other comprehensive income and, in
the case of Middleburg, excluding incremental losses to net book value related to certain specifically identified loans. Because Access
and Middleburg currently expect to complete the merger during the second quarter of 2017, the measurement of tangible equity for
these closing conditions is expected to include the impact of net income earned less dividends paid by Access and Middleburg,
respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. As a result, as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Access and Middleburg do not know of any reason why either of Access or Middleburg would not meet its
applicable minimum tangible equity closing condition in connection with the merger’s expected completion during the second quarter
of 2017. As of September 30, 2016, Access and Middleburg had tangible equity (measured as defined in the merger agreement) of
$118,060,000 and $122,609,000, respectively.

Where the merger agreement and/or law permits, Access and Middleburg could choose to waive a condition to its obligation to
complete the merger even if that condition has not been satisfied. We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be
satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed.

Business Pending the Merger

Access and Middleburg have made customary agreements that place restrictions on them until the completion of the merger. In
general, Access and Middleburg are required to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course and to take no
action that would affect adversely or delay the ability to obtain the required approvals and consents for the merger, perform the
covenants and agreements under the merger agreement or complete the merger on a timely basis.

Access and Middleburg have also agreed that, with certain exceptions, they will not, and will not permit any of their subsidiaries
to, without the prior written consent of the other party:
 

 •  amend any articles of incorporation, bylaws or other similar governing instruments;
 

 

•  issue any additional shares of capital stock or grant any stock options, restricted shares or other stock-based awards, other
than pursuant to stock options outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement and other than (i) for Access, issuances
granted pursuant to stock based awards issued in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, or (ii)
shares of Access common stock issued under Access’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan;

 

 

•  enter into or amend any written employment or severance agreement or similar arrangement with any of its directors,
officers or employees, or grant any salary or wage increase or increase any employee benefit, except for (i) normal
individual increases in compensation to employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) in the
case of Access and after consultation with Middleburg as required by the merger agreement, entering into employment
agreements in order to recruit new senior level employees in a manner that is consistent in all material respects with past
practice;

 

 
•  enter into, amend or terminate any pension, retirement, stock option, stock purchase or other employee benefit plan or

arrangement for any directors, officers or employees;
 

 
•  for Middleburg, exchange, cancel, borrow from, surrender, or increase or decrease the death benefit provided under, or

Table of Contents

No Solicitation

Access and Middleburg have agreed that, while the merger agreement is in effect, each party will not directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any “acquisition proposal” (as defined

below); or
 

 
•  engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information

relating to, an acquisition proposal.

For purposes of the merger agreement, an “acquisition proposal” means, other than transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, any of the following transactions
involving Access or Middleburg or their subsidiaries:
 

 
•  a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or

other similar transaction involving a party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 10% of the consolidated assets of the party;

 

 
•  any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 10% or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its subsidiaries or

10% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 10% of the consolidated assets of the party; or

 

 
•  any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a third party

beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 10% of the consolidated assets of the party.

Under the merger agreement, however, if Access or Middleburg receives an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal,
such party may engage in negotiations or discussions with or provide nonpublic information to the person or entity making the
acquisition proposal only if:
 

 •  such party’s board of directors receives the proposal prior to the party’s special meeting;
 

 
•  such party’s board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such actions

would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law;
 

 
•  such party’s board also concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the

acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal (as defined below); and
 

 
•  such party receives from the person or entity making the proposal an executed confidentiality agreement, which

confidentiality agreement does not provide such person or entity with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party.

Access and Middleburg have each agreed to advise the other within 24 hours following receipt of any acquisition proposal,
including a description of the material terms and conditions of the proposal (including the identity of the proposing party), and to keep
the other apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis.

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means an unsolicited, bona fide written acquisition proposal made
by a person or entity that the board of directors of Access or Middleburg, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the acquisition
proposal and including the terms and conditions of the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Access or
Middleburg, as applicable):
 

 
•  is more favorable to the shareholders of Access or Middleburg, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the

transaction contemplated by the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Access or Middleburg, as
applicable); and

 

 
•  is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and reasonably likely to receive all required approvals of

governmental authorities on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed.

Table of Contents

For the purposes of the definition of “superior proposal,” the term “acquisition proposal” has the same meaning as described
above, except the reference to “10% or more” is changed to be a reference to “a majority” and an “acquisition proposal” can only refer
to a transaction involving Middleburg or Access or one of their respective banking subsidiaries.

Furthermore, neither Access’s nor Middleburg’s board of directors will withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to
the other company (or propose publicly to do so) its recommendations of approval of the Access merger proposal and the Middleburg
merger proposal, respectively, unless (i) an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal is made by a third party and not
withdrawn, (ii) the board of directors of the applicable party concludes in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that the acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal, (iii) the board of directors of the applicable party
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law, (iv) five days elapse since the required notice is given to the
other party (three days for any notice regarding the amendment to any material term of the acquisition proposal), (v) the notifying party
considers any adjustments or modifications to the merger agreement offered by the other party and engages in good faith discussions if
requested, and (vi) the board of directors of the applicable party again reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors and taking into account any proposed modifications to the merger agreement) that the
acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal and failure to change the recommendation is reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

Termination by Access and Middleburg. The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned by Access and
Middleburg, at any time before the merger is completed, by mutual consent of the parties.

Termination by Access or Middleburg. The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned, by either party’s

merger proposal, or (ii) withholds, withdraws or modifies in any manner adverse to Access, or proposes publicly to
withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Access, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability
with respect to the Middleburg merger proposal; or

 

 
•  Middleburg fails to comply in all material respects with its obligations under the merger agreement requiring the calling and

holding of a meeting of shareholders to consider the Middleburg merger proposal or its obligations regarding the non-
solicitation of other competing offers.

In addition, Access may terminate the merger agreement at any time to enter into a definitive agreement to accept a superior
proposal, as defined in the merger agreement and described above, which has been received and considered by Access in compliance
with the applicable terms of the merger agreement, provided Access pays to Middleburg the termination fee described below.

agreements terminate upon the earlier to occur of the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms.

Voting and Standstill Agreement

Access and Middleburg have entered into a voting and standstill agreement with David L. Sokol, the largest holder of Middleburg
common stock, and the David L. Sokol Revocable Trust, of which Mr. Sokol is the sole beneficiary and trustee. Pursuant to this voting
and standstill agreement, Mr. Sokol and the trust agreed to vote all shares of Middleburg common stock beneficially owned by Mr.
Sokol and the trust in favor of the merger and the merger agreement, and against any competing acquisition proposal or any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement that could be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the
timely consummation of the merger or the fulfillment of Middleburg’s or Access’s conditions under the merger agreement.

Also pursuant to the voting and standstill agreement, Mr. Sokol and the trust agreed, until the effective date of the merger or the
termination of the merger agreement, except as consented to in writing by Access and Middleburg or as expressly contemplated by the
terms of the voting and standstill agreement or the merger agreement, not to (i) sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or
otherwise dispose of any shares of Middleburg common stock subject to the voting and standstill agreement, subject to certain limited
exceptions, (ii) acquire, offer to acquire or agree to acquire any assets of Middleburg or any subsidiary or division thereof, (iii) make or

stock other than to publicly disclose Mr. Sokol’s support of the merger and the merger agreement, (iv) submit to Middleburg any

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

Subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described herein, it is the opinion of each of Troutman Sanders LLP and
Williams Mullen that the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to “U.S. holders” (as defined below) of
Middleburg common stock that exchange their shares of Middleburg common stock for shares of Access common stock in the merger
are as described below. The following discussion is based upon the Code, regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
(“Treasury”), judicial authorities, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all
as currently in effect and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). The opinions
of tax counsel for each of Access and Middleburg are filed as Exhibit 8.1 and Exhibit 8.2, respectively, to the registration statement on
Form S-4 of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part.

This discussion does not address the tax consequences of the merger under state, local or foreign tax laws or federal laws other
than those pertaining to income tax, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or
that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences set forth below.

This discussion is limited to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold their shares of Middleburg common stock as a capital asset
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Furthermore, this discussion does not
address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular Middleburg shareholder or to Middleburg shareholders that are
subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: shareholders that are not U.S. holders; banks, thrifts or other
financial institutions; qualified insurance plans; insurance companies; mutual funds; qualified retirement plans and individual
retirement accounts; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities); regulated
investment companies; real estate investment trusts; dealers in securities or currencies; persons subject to the alternative minimum tax
provisions of the Code; former citizens or residents of the United States; persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
persons who purchased or sell their shares of Middleburg common stock as part of a wash sale; traders in securities that elect to use a
mark-to-market method of accounting; persons who own more than 5% of the outstanding common stock of Middleburg; persons who
hold Middleburg common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction; and U.S. holders who acquired
their shares of Middleburg common stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation.

For purposes of this section, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Middleburg common stock that for United States
federal income tax purposes is: a citizen or resident of the United States; a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; or a trust, the substantial decisions
of which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons and which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court, or a trust that
validly has elected under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If a partnership or other entity taxed as a partnership holds Middleburg common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in such a
partnership should consult their tax advisers about the tax consequences of the merger to them.

Holders of Middleburg common stock are urged to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the
merger in their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state,
local or foreign and other tax laws and of any changes in those laws.

The Merger

Subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described herein, the merger will be treated as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Accordingly, and as described in greater detail below, no gain or loss will be recognized for
U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of the receipt of shares of Access common stock, except for any gain or loss that may result
from the receipt of cash instead of fractional shares of Access common stock. Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon each of
Access and Middleburg receiving a written tax opinion, dated the closing date of the merger, from their respective outside legal
counsels to the effect that, based upon facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinions, the merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The issuance of the opinions is conditioned on, among other things,
such tax counsel’s receipt of representation letters from

Table of Contents

each of Access and Middleburg, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, and on customary factual
assumptions. Access and Middleburg each has the ability to waive the condition to obtain a legal opinion. Neither Access nor
Middleburg currently intends to waive this opinion condition to its obligation to consummate the merger. If either Access or
Middleburg waives this opinion condition after the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is
declared effective by the SEC, and if the tax consequences of the merger to Middleburg shareholders have materially changed, Access
and Middleburg will recirculate appropriate soliciting materials to resolicit the votes of the Access and Middleburg shareholders.
Neither of these opinions of counsel is binding on the IRS or the courts and no ruling has been, or will be, sought from the IRS as to
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a
court would not sustain, a position contrary to the consequences set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations or
assumptions upon which the opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger could be adversely affected. Accordingly, each Middleburg shareholder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the
particular tax consequences of the merger to such holder.

Consequences to Access and Middleburg

Each of Access and Middleburg will be a party to the merger within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, and neither
Access nor Middleburg will recognize any gain or loss as a result of the merger.

Consequences to Shareholders

Exchange of Middleburg Common Stock for Access Common Stock. U.S. holders of Middleburg common stock that exchange
all of their Middleburg common stock for Access common stock will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, except, as discussed below, with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Access common stock.

Cash Received in Lieu of Fractional Shares. A U.S. holder that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Access common
stock in the merger generally will be treated as if the fractional share of Access common stock had been distributed to them as part of
the merger, and then redeemed by Access in exchange for the cash actually distributed in lieu of the fractional share, with the
redemption generally qualifying as an “exchange” under Section 302 of the Code. Consequently, those holders generally will recognize
capital gain or loss with respect to the cash payments they receive in lieu of fractional shares measured by the difference between the
amount of cash received and the tax basis allocated to the fractional shares, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the
effective date of the merger, the holding period of such shares is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Tax Basis in, and Holding Period for, Access Common Stock. A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in the Access common stock
received in the merger will be equal to such shareholder’s aggregate tax basis in the Middleburg common stock surrendered in the
merger, reduced by any basis allocable to a fractional share of Access common stock for which cash is received. The holding period of
Access common stock received by a U.S. holder in the merger will include the holding period of the Middleburg common stock
exchanged in the merger if the Middleburg common stock exchanged is held as a capital asset at the time of the merger. If a U.S. holder
acquired different blocks of Middleburg common stock at different times or at different prices, the Access common stock such holder
receives will be allocated pro rata to each block of Middleburg common stock, and the basis and holding period of each block of
Access common stock such holder receives will be determined on a block-for-block basis depending on the basis and holding period of
the blocks of Middleburg common stock exchanged for such block of Access common stock.

Backup Withholding and Reporting Requirements

U.S. holders of Middleburg common stock, other than certain exempt recipients, may be subject to backup withholding at a rate
of 28% with respect to any cash payment received in the merger in lieu of fractional shares. However, backup withholding will not
apply to any U.S. holder that either (a) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup
withholding or (b) otherwise proves to Access and its exchange agent that the U.S. holder is exempt from backup withholding. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, provided the holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

Table of Contents

In addition, U.S. holders of Middleburg common stock are required to retain permanent records and make such records available
to any authorized IRS officers and employees. The records should include the number of shares of Middleburg stock exchanged, the
number of shares of Access stock received, the fair market value and tax basis of Middleburg shares exchanged and the U.S. holder’s
tax basis in the Access common stock received.

If a U.S. holder of Middleburg common stock that exchanges such stock for Access common stock is a “significant holder” with
respect to Middleburg, the U.S. holder is required to include a statement with respect to the exchange on or with the federal income tax
return of the U.S. holder for the year of the exchange. A U.S. holder of Middleburg common stock will be treated as a significant
holder in Middleburg if the U.S. holder’s ownership interest in Middleburg is five percent (5%) or more of Middleburg’s issued and
outstanding common stock or if the U.S. holder’s basis in the shares of Middleburg stock exchanged is one million dollars ($1,000,000)
or more. The statement must be prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 and must be entitled “STATEMENT
PURSUANT TO §1.368-3 BY [INSERT NAME AND TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF TAXPAYER], A
SIGNIFICANT HOLDER”. The statement must include the names and employer identification numbers of Middleburg and Access,
the date of the merger, and the fair market value and tax basis of Middleburg shares exchanged (determined immediately before the
merger).

The foregoing tax discussion is only a summary. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, tax advice.
Holders of Middleburg common stock are urged to consult their independent tax advisors with respect to the application of
U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate
or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

Middleburg are subject to certain regulatory and other legal restrictions on the amount of dividends they are permitted to pay to Access
and Middleburg. See “Description of Access Capital Stock – Common Stock –Dividends” on page 96.

Access currently pays dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis, and it anticipates declaring and paying quarterly
dividends after completion of the merger. Access has no current intention to change its dividend strategy, but has and will continue to
evaluate that decision on a quarterly basis. After the merger, the final determination of the timing, amount and payment of dividends on
Access common stock will be at the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of Access and its
subsidiaries, the financial condition of Access and other factors, including general economic conditions and applicable governmental
regulations and policies.

DESCRIPTION OF ACCESS CAPITAL STOCK

The following summary description of the material features of the capital stock of Access is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the applicable provisions of Virginia law and by Access’s articles of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended.

As a result of the merger, Middleburg shareholders who receive shares of Access common stock in the merger will become
shareholders of Access. Your rights as shareholders of Access will be governed by Virginia law and the articles of incorporation and
the bylaws of Access, each as amended. We urge you to read the applicable provisions of the Virginia SCA, Access’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws and federal laws governing bank holding companies carefully and in their entirety. Copies of Access’s and
Middleburg’s governing documents have been filed with the SEC. To find out where copies of these documents can be obtained, see
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

Authorized and Outstanding Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of Access consists of (i) 60,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.835 per share; and (ii)
1,000,000 shares of undesignated serial preferred stock. As of the record date of the Access special meeting, January 31, 2017, there
were 10,695,300 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 440 holders of record, and no shares of
preferred stock issued and outstanding. As of January 31, 2017, there were options outstanding to purchase 421,880 shares of Access
common stock. Access has not granted any restricted stock awards.

Common Stock

General. Each share of Access common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of
Access common stock. Access’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ANCX.” The transfer
agent for Access’s common stock is Computershare, P.O. Box 30170, College Station, Texas, 77842.

Dividends. Access’s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends or distributions that its board of directors may declare out of
funds legally available for those payments. The payment of distributions by Access is subject to the restrictions of Virginia law
applicable to the declaration of distributions by a corporation. A Virginia corporation generally may not authorize and make
distributions if, after giving effect to the distribution, it would be unable to meet its debts as they become due in the usual course of
business or if the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if it
were dissolved at that time, to satisfy the preferential rights of shareholders whose rights are superior to the rights of those receiving
the distribution. In addition, the payment of distributions to shareholders is subject to any prior rights of outstanding preferred stock.

As a bank holding company, Access’s ability to pay dividends is affected by the ability of Access National Bank, its bank
subsidiary, to pay dividends to the holding company. The ability of Access National Bank, as well as Access, to pay dividends in the
future is, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines.

Liquidation Rights. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Access, the holders of shares of its common
stock will be entitled to receive, after payment of all debts and liabilities of Access and after satisfaction of all liquidation preferences
applicable to any preferred stock, all remaining assets of Access available for distribution in cash or in kind.

Voting Rights. The holders of Access common stock are entitled to one vote per share and, in general, a majority of votes cast
with respect to a matter is sufficient to authorize action upon routine matters. Holders of Access common stock are not entitled to
cumulative voting rights. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, and shareholders do not have the right to accumulate
their votes in the election of directors.

Directors and Classes of Directors. Access’s board of directors is divided into three classes with directors serving staggered
three-year terms. Any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships are apportioned among the classes as evenly as
possible. Currently, the Access board of directors consists of seven (7) directors. Under Access’s articles of incorporation, directors
may be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

No Preemptive Rights; Redemption and Assessment. Holders of shares of Access will not be entitled to preemptive rights with
respect to any shares that may be issued. Access common stock is not subject to redemption or any sinking fund and the outstanding
shares are fully paid and nonassessable.

Preferred Stock

The board of directors of Access is empowered to authorize the issuance, in one or more series, of shares of preferred stock at
such times, for such purposes and for such consideration as it may deem advisable without shareholder approval. The Access board of
directors is also authorized to fix the designations, voting, conversion, preference and other relative rights, qualifications and
limitations of any such series of preferred stock. The Access board of directors, without shareholder approval, may authorize the
issuance of one or more series of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights which could adversely affect the voting power of
the holders of Access common stock and, under certain circumstances, discourage an attempt by others to gain control of Access.

The creation and issuance of any series of preferred stock, and the relative rights, designations and preferences of such series, if
and when established, will depend upon, among other things, the future capital needs of Access, then existing market conditions and
other factors that, in the judgment of the Access board, might warrant the issuance of preferred stock.

COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Access and Middleburg are Virginia corporations subject to the provisions of the Virginia SCA. The rights of shareholders of
Access and Middleburg are governed by their respective articles of incorporation and bylaws. Upon completion of the proposed
merger, Middleburg shareholders will become shareholders of Access and, as such, their shareholder rights will be governed by the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Access and will continue to be governed by the Virginia SCA.

The following is a summary of the material differences in the rights of shareholders of Access and Middleburg, but is not a
complete statement of all those differences. Shareholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of the Virginia SCA and the
respective articles of incorporation and bylaws of Access and Middleburg. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Access and Middleburg and to the provisions of the Virginia SCA.

Authorized Capital Stock

Access. Access is authorized to issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of which 10,695,300 shares
were issued and outstanding as of the record date for the Access special meeting, and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated serial preferred
stock, of which no shares were issued and outstanding as of the record date for the Access special meeting.

Access’s articles of incorporation permit its board of directors, without shareholder approval, to fix the preferences, limitations,
and relative rights of its preferred stock and to establish series of such preferred stock and determine the variations between each series.
Holders of Access stock of any class do not have any preemptive right to subscribe to or purchase (i) any shares of capital stock of
Access (ii) any securities convertible into such shares, or (iii) any options, warrants or rights to purchase such shares or securities
convertible into any such shares.

Middleburg. Middleburg is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of which
7,205,066 shares were issued and outstanding as of the record date for the Middleburg special meeting, and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, $2.50 par value per share, of which no shares were issued and outstanding as of the record date for the Middleburg
special meeting.

Middleburg’s articles of incorporation permit its board of directors, without shareholder approval, to fix the preferences,
limitations, and relative rights of its preferred stock and to establish series of such preferred stock and determine the variations between
each series. Holders of Middleburg stock of any class do not have any preemptive right to subscribe to or purchase (i) any shares of
capital stock of Middleburg, (ii) any warrants, rights or options to purchase such shares, or (iii) any obligations convertible into such
shares or into any warrants, rights or options to purchase any such shares.

Dividend Rights

The holders of Access and Middleburg common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends when and as declared by their
respective board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Access’s and Middleburg’s articles of incorporation permit their
boards to issue preferred stock with terms set by their boards, which terms may include the right to receive dividends ahead of the
holders of their common stock. Neither Access nor Middleburg currently has any outstanding shares of preferred stock.

Voting Rights

The holders of both Access and Middleburg common stock have one vote for each share held on any matter presented for
consideration by the holders of common stock at a shareholder meeting. Neither the holders of Access nor Middleburg common stock
are entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors.

Directors and Classes of Directors

Access. The Access board is divided into three classes, apportioned as evenly as possible, with directors serving staggered three-
year terms. The Access bylaws require the board to have not less than three nor more than 15 directors, and
 

98

Table of Contents

the Access board is authorized to set and change the actual number of directors from time to time within those limits. Currently, the
Access board consists of seven directors. Directors of Access may be removed by shareholders of Access only for cause and with the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

On or prior to the effective date of the merger, the Access board will cause the number of directors that will comprise the full
board of Access at the effective date to be fixed at thirteen directors, consisting of (i) seven Access directors, including the current
Chief Executive Officer of Access, and (ii) six current Middleburg directors to be agreed upon by Access and Middleburg, including
the current Chairman and the current Chief Executive Officer of Middleburg.

Middleburg. The Middleburg board is not divided into classes and all directors are elected at each annual meeting to serve one-
year terms. The Middleburg bylaws require the board to have 11 directors. Directors of Middleburg may be removed with or without
cause upon the affirmative vote of at least seventy-five percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

Anti-takeover Provisions

Certain provisions of the Virginia SCA and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Access and Middleburg may discourage
attempts to acquire control of Access or Middleburg, respectively, that the majority of either company’s shareholders may determine
was in their best interests. These provisions also may render the removal of one or all directors more difficult or deter or delay
corporate changes of control that the Access or Middleburg boards did not approve.

Classified Board of Directors. The provisions of Access’s articles of incorporation providing for classification of the board of
directors into three separate classes may have certain anti-takeover effects. Middleburg’s articles of incorporation do not provide for
classification of the board of directors.

Authorized Preferred Stock. The articles of incorporation of both Access and Middleburg authorize the issuance of preferred
stock. The Access and Middleburg boards may, subject to application of Virginia law and federal banking regulations, authorize the
issuance of preferred stock at such times, for such purposes and for such consideration as either board may deem advisable without
further shareholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances may have the effect of discouraging an
attempt by a third party to acquire control of Access or Middleburg by, for example, authorizing the issuance of a series of preferred
stock with rights and preferences designed to impede the proposed transaction.

Supermajority Voting Provisions. The Virginia SCA provides that, unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation provide for a
greater or lesser vote, certain significant corporate actions must be approved by the affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of all the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Certain corporate actions requiring a more than two-thirds vote include:
 

 •  adoption of plans of merger or share exchange;
 

 •  sales of all or substantially all of a corporation’s assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and
 

 •  adoption of plans of dissolution.

The Virginia SCA provides that a corporation’s articles may either increase the vote required to approve those actions or may
decrease the vote required to not less than a majority of all the votes cast by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a
quorum of the voting group exists. The articles of incorporation of Access do not modify the vote required to approve those actions.

The articles of incorporation of Middleburg state that the actions set out above must be approved by a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast on the transaction by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is
present, provided that the transaction has been approved and recommended by at least two-thirds of the “continuing directors.” With
respect to Middleburg, if the transaction is not so approved and recommended by two-thirds of the “continuing directors,” then the
transaction must be approved by the affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on such transaction
by each voting group entitled to vote.

Under the articles of incorporation of Middleburg, a “continuing director” is (i) any individual who has been elected to the
Middleburg board at an annual meeting of Middleburg’s shareholders more than one time, or (ii) any individual who was

Table of Contents

elected to fill a vacancy on the Middleburg board and received the affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing directors then on the
Middleburg board and thereafter elected to the Middleburg board at an annual meeting of Middleburg’s shareholders at least one time.

Anti-takeover Statutes. Virginia has two anti-takeover statutes in force, the Affiliated Transactions Statute and the Control Share
Acquisitions Statute.

The Affiliated Transaction Statute of the Virginia SCA contains provisions governing “affiliated transactions.” These include
various transactions such as mergers, share exchanges, sales, leases, or other dispositions of material assets, issuances of securities,
dissolutions, and similar transactions with an “interested shareholder.” An interested shareholder is generally the beneficial owner of
more than 10% of any class of a corporation’s outstanding voting shares. During the three years following the date a shareholder
becomes an interested shareholder, any affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder must be approved by both a majority (but
not less than two) of the “disinterested directors” (those directors who were directors before the interested shareholder became an
interested shareholder or who were recommended for election by a majority of the disinterested directors) and by the affirmative vote
of the holders of two-thirds of the corporation’s voting shares other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. These
requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among other things, a majority of the disinterested directors approve the
interested shareholder’s acquisition of voting shares making such a person an interested shareholder before such acquisition. Beginning
three years after the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the corporation may engage in an affiliated transaction with the
interested shareholder if:
 

 
•  the transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporation’s voting shares, other than shares beneficially

owned by the interested shareholder;
 

 •  the affiliated transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or
 

 
•  subject to certain additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the holders of each class or series of voting shares will

receive consideration meeting specified fair price and other requirements designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair
and equivalent consideration, regardless of when they tendered their shares.

Under the Virginia SCA’s Control Share Acquisitions Statute, voting rights of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation acquired
by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership levels of 20%, 33 1⁄3%, and 50% of the outstanding shares may, under certain
circumstances, be denied. The voting rights may be denied:
 

 
•  unless conferred by a special shareholder vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, other than

shares held by the acquiring person and officers and directors of the corporation; or
 

 
•  among other exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to a merger agreement with the corporation or the

corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the acquisition of such shares before the acquiring person’s
acquisition thereof.

If authorized in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to redeem the
acquired shares at the average per share price paid for such shares if the voting rights are not approved or if the acquiring person does
not file a “control share acquisition statement” with the corporation within 60 days of the last acquisition of such shares. If voting
rights are approved for control shares comprising more than 50% of the corporation’s outstanding stock, objecting shareholders may
have the right to have their shares repurchased by the corporation for “fair value.”

The provisions of the Affiliated Transactions Statute and the Control Share Acquisitions Statute are only applicable to public
corporations that have more than 300 shareholders. Corporations may provide in their articles of incorporation or bylaws to opt-out of
the Control Share Acquisitions Statute. Neither Access nor Middleburg has opted-out of the Control Share Acquisitions Statute.

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

The Virginia SCA generally requires that in order for an amendment to the articles of incorporation to be adopted it must be
approved by each voting group entitled to vote on the proposed amendment by more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast
by that voting group, unless the Virginia SCA otherwise requires a greater vote, or the articles of incorporation provide for a greater or
lesser vote, or a vote by separate voting groups. However, under the Virginia SCA, no amendment to the articles of incorporation may
be approved by a vote that is less than a majority of all the votes cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote at a
meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.

Table of Contents

Under the Virginia SCA, unless another process is set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a majority of the directors
(except to the extent authority to amend the bylaws is reserved by the Virginia SCA), or, if a quorum exists at a meeting of
shareholders, a majority of the shareholders present and entitled to vote may adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws.

Access. Access’s articles of incorporation may be amended pursuant to the Virginia SCA provisions described above.

Access’s bylaws may be amended or repealed by the board of directors except to the extent that (i) such power is reserved
exclusively to the shareholders by law or Access’s articles of incorporation; or (ii) the shareholders in adopting or amending particular
bylaws provide expressly that the board of directors may not amend or repeal the same. Access’s bylaws may be amended or repealed
by the shareholders even though the same also may be amended or repealed by the board of directors.

Middleburg. Middleburg’s articles of incorporation state that an amendment to the articles of incorporation must be approved by
a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of
the voting group is present, provided that the amendment has been approved and recommended by at least two-thirds of the continuing
directors. If the amendment is not so approved and recommended by two-thirds of the continuing directors, then the amendment must
be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of more than two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of Middleburg common
stock.

Middleburg’s bylaws may be amended, altered, or repealed by the board of directors except to the extent that bylaws adopted by
Middleburg’s shareholders otherwise provide. Middleburg’s shareholders have the power to rescind, alter, amend, or repeal any bylaws.

Dissenters’ and Appraisal Rights

The Virginia SCA provides that appraisal rights are not available to holders of shares of any class or series of shares of a Virginia
corporation in a merger when the stock is either listed on a national securities exchange, such as the NASDAQ Global Market, or is
held by at least 2,000 shareholders of record and has a public float of at least $20 million. Despite this exception, appraisal rights will
be available to holders of common stock of a Virginia corporation in a merger if:
 

 
•  the articles of incorporation provide for appraisal rights regardless of an available exception (although neither Access’s nor

Middleburg’s articles of incorporation authorize such special appraisal rights);
 

 

•  in the case of a merger or share exchange, shareholders are required by the terms of the merger to accept anything for their
shares other than cash, shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation, or shares of another corporation that are either listed
on a national securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 shareholders of record having a public float of at least $20
million, or a combination of cash or such shares; or

 

 
•  the merger is an “affiliated transaction,” as described under “– Anti-takeover Provisions” above, and it has not been

approved by a majority of the disinterested directors.

The stock of Access is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market and the stock of Middleburg is listed on the NASDAQ Capital
Market. Therefore, unless one of the exceptions outlined above applies to a given transaction, shareholders of Access and Middleburg
are not entitled to appraisal rights. Shareholders of Access and Middleburg are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

Director and Officer Exculpation

The Virginia SCA provides that in any proceeding brought by or in the right of a corporation or brought by or on behalf of
shareholders of the corporation, the damages assessed against an officer or director arising out of a single transaction, occurrence or
course of conduct may not exceed the lesser of (a) the monetary amount, including the elimination of liability, specified in the articles
of incorporation or, if approved by the shareholders, in the bylaws as a limitation on or elimination of the liability of the officer or
director, or (b) the greater of (i) $100,000 or (ii) the amount of cash compensation received by the officer or director from the
corporation during the twelve months immediately preceding the act or omission for which liability was imposed. The liability of an
officer or director is not limited under the Virginia SCA or a corporation’s articles of incorporation and bylaws if the officer or director
engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or of any federal or state securities law.

Table of Contents

The articles of incorporation of Access provide that, to the full extent that the Virginia SCA permits the limitation or elimination
of liability of directors or officers, a director or officer of Access is not liable to Access or its shareholders for monetary damages. The
articles of incorporation of Middleburg provide that, to the full extent that the Virginia SCA permits the limitation or elimination of
liability of directors and officers, a director or officer is not liable to Middleburg or its shareholders for any monetary damages in
excess of one dollar.

Indemnification

The articles of incorporation of Access and Middleburg provide that, to the full extent permitted by the Virginia SCA, each of
Access and Middleburg is required to indemnify a director or officer against liabilities, fines, penalties and claims imposed upon or
asserted against him or her by reason of having been a director or officer and against all expenses reasonably incurred by him or her in
connection therewith, except in relation to matters as to which he or she is liable by reason of his or her willful misconduct or knowing
violation of criminal law. Each of Access’s and Middleburg’s board of directors is empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of
disinterested directors, to contract in advance to indemnify any director or officer or any other employee or agent of the corporation, to
the same extent as set forth above.

CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (“Middleburg”).

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Access and Middleburg have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective shareholders to consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Middleburg will merge

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Access and Middleburg have each determined that the Merger is consistent with and will
further their respective business strategies and goals; and

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization”

constitute, and is adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

shareholders of the Continuing Corporation following the Effective Date, and the Continuing Corporation’s proxy materials with
respect to such annual meeting shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation that its

time change the method or timing of effecting the combination of Middleburg Bank and Access Bank (including, without limitation,
the provisions of this Section 1.5(a) of the Agreement) if and to the extent Access deems such changes necessary, appropriate or
desirable for any reason in its discretion; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of Merger
Consideration (as defined herein), (ii) adversely affect the ability of the Merger to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
provided, further, that Access shall provide Middleburg with seven days’ prior written notice of such change and the reasons therefor.

serve as officers and directors of Access Bank after the effective date of the Bank Merger.

operated by the Continuing Corporation upon the Effective Date, subject to the opening or closing of any branch offices that may be
authorized by federal and state banking regulators. After the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall initially operate the

the date of this Agreement (with any change to the use of such name or logo after the Effective Date to require a majority vote of the

$0.835 per share, of the Continuing Corporation (“Continuing Corporation Common Stock”) (together, with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5, the “Merger Consideration”).

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Date, the outstanding shares of Access Common Stock or Middleburg
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities

be deposited, with the Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this
Article 2 in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, and (ii) duly authorize and direct issuance by the
Exchange Agent of non-certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable
pursuant to this Article 2.

(c) Distributions to Holders of Middleburg Common Stock. Upon the Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding share of
Middleburg Common Stock who has properly surrendered such Certificates (as defined herein) or non-certificated shares represented
by book-entry registry of Middleburg Common Stock (the “Book-Entry Shares”) to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
such certificates) will be entitled to evidence of issuance in book entry form the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock (except if such holder has made an election to receive a physical stock certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(d) of this
Agreement) and the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of shares of Middleburg Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. If a holder of
Middleburg Common Stock surrenders such Certificates representing shares of Middleburg Common Stock (the “Certificates”) or
Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, within two (2) business
days following the Effective Date, to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the consideration into which the shares of such
Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. If a holder of Middleburg Common Stock surrenders
such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at any time after five (5)
business days prior to the Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to
promptly, but in no event later than five (5) business days following receipt of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly
executed letter of transmittal, deliver to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the consideration into which the shares of such
Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Middleburg Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders his or her Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 2.2. The Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall be, as applicable, duly endorsed or accompanied with such transfer and other documentation as the
Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of the Middleburg Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law.

(d) Letter of Transmittal. Access shall take all steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days
after the Effective Date, to mail to each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not previously surrendered such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of such Middleburg Common
Stock have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Such letter of transmittal shall permit each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock represented by book-entry registry, a physical
stock certificate representing shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to this Article 2.

(e) Lost Certificates. A holder of Middleburg Common Stock whose Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are
otherwise missing shall be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions to which such
shareholder shall be entitled upon compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation and the Exchange
Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance with the Continuing Corporation’s and the Exchange Agent’s standard
policy (including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond or other customary
indemnity).

Section 2.3 Rights of Former Holders of Middleburg Common Stock.

At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of Middleburg shall be closed as to holders of Middleburg Common Stock, and no
transfer of Middleburg Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 of this Agreement, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the
Effective Date represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor. To the extent permitted by law, former holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the
Effective Date at any meeting of Continuing Corporation shareholders the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock into which their respective shares of Middleburg

exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by the Continuing
Corporation on the Continuing Corporation Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Date, the declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution
payable to the holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Date shall be delivered to the
holder of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the Effective Date until such holder surrenders such Book-
Entry Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Agreement. However, upon surrender of such Book-Entry
Share or Certificate representing Middleburg Common Stock the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered dividends or
other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by
such Certificate.

Section 2.4 Middleburg Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of Middleburg Common Stock (a “Middleburg Stock Option”)
granted under an equity or equity-based compensation plan of Middleburg (a “Middleburg Stock Plan”), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease, at the Effective Date, to represent a right to
acquire Middleburg Common Stock and shall be converted at the Effective Date, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the difference between the closing sale price of
Middleburg Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date and the per
share exercise price of the Middleburg Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (ii) the number of shares of
Middleburg Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Option, subject to any applicable withholdings. If the exercise price of a
Middleburg Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Date is greater than the closing sale price of Middleburg Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date, then at the Effective Date such option
shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange therefor. Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all commercially
reasonable actions to give effect to this Section 2.4(a) including, without limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
written consent from each holder of a Middleburg Stock Option to the cancellation of such Middleburg Stock Option in exchange for
the cash payment provided by this Section 2.4(a).

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all actions necessary to cause each Middleburg Stock Plan to terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Date.

(c) At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under a Middleburg Stock Plan (a “Middleburg Stock Award”)
which is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall fully vest and shall be converted into the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, and the shares of Middleburg Common
Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of Middleburg Common Stock for
such purposes.

Section 2.5 No Fractional Shares.

Each holder of shares of Middleburg Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger which would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest
and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
multiplied by the closing sale price of Access Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the trading day immediately
preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

Section 2.6 Treasury Warrant.

At the Effective Date, each Treasury Warrant (as defined herein), which is then outstanding and unexercised shall cease to
represent a right to acquire Middleburg Common Stock and shall be converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined in accordance with the terms of such Treasury Warrant.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights.

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of

withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

Retrieval system, made available to the other party copies of such SEC Reports. Its SEC Reports, including the financial statements,
exhibits and schedules contained therein, (A) at the time filed, complied (and any SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement
will comply) in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and (B) at the time
they were filed (or if amended or superseded by another SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
filing), did not (and any SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement will not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements made in such SEC
Reports, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(ii) Each of its financial statements contained in or incorporated by reference into any SEC Reports (including any
SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement) (the “Financial Statements”) complied (or, in the case of SEC Reports filed after
the date of this Agreement, will comply) in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act with respect thereto, fairly presented (or, in the case of SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly
present) the consolidated financial position of it and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the

(iii) It and each of its Subsidiaries has devised and maintains a system of “internal controls over financial reporting”

respect to any differences.

(iv) Its “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by it in its SEC Reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. It has disclosed,
to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of Directors and on Section 3.3(f)(iv) of its Disclosure Letter (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect
in any material respect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not

certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of this Agreement, “principal executive officer” and “principal
financial officer” shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Bank Reports. It and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto (the “Bank Reports”), that they were required to file since
December 31, 2012 with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission and any other federal, state or foreign
governmental or regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over it or each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Regulatory
Agencies”), including any Bank Report required to be filed pursuant to the laws of the United States, any state or any Regulatory
Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such Bank
Report or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it. Any such Bank Report regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries filed with or otherwise submitted to any

benefits triggered by a change in control or otherwise and the amounts potentially payable to each such individual in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in

respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under any of the terms thereof. Each such insurance policy is outstanding
and in full force and effect, and all premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder
have been filed in due and timely fashion. Since December 31, 2015, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a
premium increase or cancellation or a failure to renew with respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last three (3) calendar

existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those
presently in effect, other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that do not result from any extraordinary
loss experience on the part of it or its Subsidiaries. Set forth in Section 3.3(p) of its Disclosure Letter is a list of all insurance policies or
bonds currently maintained by it and its Subsidiaries.

notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions
of any such Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a “Notice of Recommendation Change”) (it being understood
that any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change, except
that, in such case, the five (5) business day period referred to in this clause (D) and in clauses (E) and (F) shall be reduced to three (3)
business days following the giving of such new Notice of Recommendation Change), (E) during such five (5) business day period, the
notifying party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other party, engaged in good faith discussions with such party
regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party, and (F) the board of directors of
the party proposing to take such action, following such five (5) business day period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under
applicable law.

Section 5.9 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall provide to
officers and employees of Middleburg and its Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Date become employees of the Continuing
Corporation or its Subsidiaries (“Middleburg Continuing Employees”), employee benefits under Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation, on terms and conditions which are the same as for similarly situated officers and employees of the Continuing
Corporation and its Subsidiaries. Until such time as the Middleburg Continuing Employees are able to participate in the Benefit Plans
of the Continuing Corporation, the Continuing Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the Middleburg Continuing Employees the
Benefit Plans maintained by Middleburg immediately prior to the Effective Date (it being understood that participation in the
Continuing Corporation’s Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each Benefit Plan); provided, however, that
this provision shall not apply to any Benefit Plan of Middleburg or its Subsidiaries that was terminated or in which participation was
frozen on or prior to the Effective Date.

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and, for vacation or similar paid time off accrual only, benefit accrual under the
Continuing Corporation’s Benefit Plans, service with or credited by Middleburg or any of its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service
with the Continuing Corporation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Continuing Corporation shall cause welfare Benefit
Plans maintained by the Continuing Corporation that cover the Middleburg Continuing Employees after the Effective Date to (i) waive
any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions that
were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that were applicable, under the Benefit Plans maintained by Middleburg), and (ii) cause
any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Middleburg Continuing Employees under welfare
Benefit Plans maintained by Middleburg to be credited to such Middleburg Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit Plans
maintained by the Continuing Corporation, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket
payments payable by such Middleburg Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing Corporation.

(c) With respect to the Middleburg Financial Corporation 401(k) Plan (the “Middleburg 401(k) Plan”), Middleburg shall
cause such plan to be fully vested and terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Date, in accordance with applicable law
and subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each Middleburg Continuing Employee who is a
participant in the Middleburg 401(k) Plan shall be eligible to participate in Access’s 401(k) plan as soon as administratively practical
after the Effective Date, and account balances under the terminated Middleburg 401(k) Plan will be eligible for distribution or rollover,
including direct rollover, to Access’s 401(k) plan for the Middleburg Continuing Employees. Any other former employee of
Middleburg or its Subsidiaries who is employed by Access or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date shall be eligible to be a
participant in Access’s 401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility requirements. Access shall take commercially reasonable steps to
cause the Access 401(k) plan to accept the direct rollover of loan notes from the Middleburg 401(k) Plan to the Access 401(k) plan for
each Middleburg Continuing Employee who elects such a direct rollover.

(d) With regard to the Middleburg Financial Corporation Money Purchase Pension Plan (the “MPPP”), prior to the Effective
Date, Middleburg shall amend the MPPP, effective as of the Effective Date, to cease all participation in, cease all future contributions
to, fully vest the account balances of participants thereunder, and terminate the MPPP in accordance with applicable law. Middleburg
shall timely provide all notices required under ERISA and the Code in order for the freeze of all contributions and termination of the
MPPP to be effective on the Effective Date. In determining the contribution to the MPPP for the 2017 plan year (the “2017
Contribution”), which 2017 Contribution shall be properly accrued as a liability of Middleburg prior to the Effective Date, the parties
agree, and Middleburg shall reflect such agreement in an amendment to the MPPP, that the 2017 Contribution shall be made to
participants in the MPPP who are employed on the Effective Date and shall be based upon a participant’s compensation (as defined in
the MPPP) through the Effective Date. Access shall submit the MPPP for a favorable determination letter following the Effective Date
and distributions shall be made in accordance with applicable law after receipt of a favorable determination letter.

(e) Within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all steps necessary to terminate effective
immediately preceding the Effective Date the Middleburg Financial Corporation Supplemental Benefit Plan. Access shall be
responsible for payment of amounts accrued under such plan to the participants on the thirtieth day following the Effective Date in a
lump sum, net of applicable tax withholdings. All documents issued, adopted or executed in connection

with the implementation of this Section 5.9(e) shall be subject to Access’s prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Middleburg also agrees to properly and fully accrue all liabilities associated with such plan, and any
other non-qualified plans or compensation arrangements, on its books prior to the Effective Date.

(f) Prior to the Effective Date, at the request of Access, Middleburg shall take all steps necessary to terminate any Benefit
Plans of Middleburg or a Subsidiary immediately preceding the Effective Date and pay any benefits due thereunder in accordance with
the terms of any such plan provided, however, that Access agrees to maintain the Middleburg Benefit Plans that are group health plans
through the end of the plan year that ends during the calendar year that includes the Effective Date.

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to limit the right of the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
from and after the Effective Date, to amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans maintained by Access or Middleburg or their
respective Subsidiaries before the Effective Date to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the
applicable Benefit Plan.

Section 5.10 Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing.

(a) Access shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to authorize and reserve for issuance such number of shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, and to cause all such shares, when issued pursuant to
this Agreement, to be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(b) Access shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Effective Date.

Section 5.11 Indemnification.

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from Middleburg or any of its Subsidiaries (an “Indemnified
Party”) (in all capacities), to the same extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to indemnification pursuant to
applicable law and Middleburg’s Organizational Documents or any Middleburg Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents, as the case
may be, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (including advancing expenses when requested, subject to such person’s compliance
with Section 13.1-699 of the VSCA). Without limiting the foregoing, in any case or proceeding in which corporate approval may be
required to effectuate any indemnification, the Continuing Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall direct, if any Indemnified
Party elects, that the determination of permissibility of indemnification shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between the Continuing Corporation or such Subsidiary and such Indemnified Party.

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall, at or prior to the Effective Date, purchase a six (6) year “tail” prepaid policy on the
same terms and conditions as the existing directors’ and officers’ liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by Middleburg from
insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, covering, without limitation, the Merger; provided, however, that the cost of such
“tail” policy shall in no event exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the amount of the last annual premium paid by Middleburg for
such existing directors’ and officers’ liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
the Continuing Corporation would be required to expend more than three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums, the
Continuing Corporation will obtain the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’
and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Middleburg or any of its Subsidiaries for
any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this Section 5.11 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
respective heirs and legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the other rights provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

Section 5.12 Employment and Other Arrangements.

(a) Except for employees of Middleburg and its Subsidiaries with individual agreements that provide for payment of
severance under certain circumstances (who will be paid severance only in accordance with such agreements), Access agrees that each
employee of Middleburg and its Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated by Access or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for cause)
on or within six months of the Effective Date shall receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on
the termination date) for each year of service at Middleburg or its Subsidiaries (with credit for partial years of service) with a maximum
payment equal to twenty-six weeks of base pay. A former employee of Middleburg or its Subsidiaries must execute a general release of
claims before any severance payment shall be made pursuant to this Section 5.12(a), and all such releases of claims shall be in a form
approved in writing in advance by Access.

(b) Middleburg and Access will establish a retention bonus pool that will be dedicated to certain of their non-executive
officer employees for purposes of retaining such employees prior to and after the Effective Date, with the participating employees and

(c) Within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all steps necessary to terminate the employment
agreements listed on Section 5.12(c) of the Disclosure Letter of Middleburg (collectively, the “Affected Agreements”) immediately
preceding the Effective Date. On the ninetieth day after the Effective Date, Access shall pay in a lump sum, net of applicable tax
withholdings, (A) to Messrs. Shook, Culver and Mehra, the cash amount described in Section 7(h)(i) of the Affected Agreements and
(B) to Mr. Hartley, the amounts described in Section 7(d)(1) of the Affected Agreement; provided, however, that such cash amount
shall be reduced as necessary to insure that the amount so paid (when aggregated with any other benefits or payments payable upon a
change of control to the affected executive) will not constitute an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code, as determined by Access’s outside accounting firm, in consultation with Troutman Sanders and counsel to the affected
executive. All documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this Section 5.12(c) shall be subject to
Access’s prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all steps necessary to obtain (i) a general release from each of the
individuals listed in Section 5.12(d)(i) of the Disclosure Letter of Middleburg associated with each individual’s respective employment

by it or any Subsidiary. With respect to the leases disclosed in Section 5.13 of its Disclosure Letter, Middleburg and each of its
Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary or appropriate to transfer and assign, as of the

use and operation of the leased premises by the Continuing Corporation.

Section 5.14 Change of Method.

Access and Middleburg shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement and at any time prior to the Effective Date, to change
the method or structure of effecting the combination of Access and Middleburg (including the provisions of Article 1 and Article 2), if
and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the Exchange Ratio, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of Middleburg’s shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii)
adversely affect the tax treatment of Middleburg or Access pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties hereto agree to reflect any such
change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

Section 5.15 Takeover Laws.

If any Takeover Laws may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are

may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any such laws or regulations on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

At Closing, Middleburg shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its Loan,

reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Access.

Section 5.17 Supplemental Indenture.

Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg and Access shall take all actions necessary for Access to enter into a supplemental
indenture with the trustee of Middleburg’s Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2034 to evidence the succession of
Access as the obligor on those securities as of the Effective Date. The form of supplemental indenture shall be reasonably acceptable to

or affiliates (or combination thereof) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give the other the
opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any such litigation. In addition, no such settlement by
Middleburg shall be agreed to without Access’s prior written consent, no such settlement by Access shall be agreed to without
Middleburg’s prior written consent, and no such consent of Access or Middleburg shall be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 5.20 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).

Middleburg and Access agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain certain directors and officers of Middleburg
in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Date, it is desirable that such directors and officers not be subject to
a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of
this Section 5.20. The Board of Directors of Access and of Middleburg, or a committee of non-employee directors (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition of
Middleburg Common Stock, Middleburg Stock Awards or Middleburg Stock Options by such directors and officers, and the acquisition
of Continuing Corporation Common Stock by such directors and officers, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

PLAN OF MERGER
BETWEEN

ACCESS NATIONAL CORPORATION

ARTICLE 1
Terms of the Merger

1.1 The Merger.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of October 21, 2016, by and between
Access and Middleburg (the “Agreement”), at the Effective Date (as defined herein), Middleburg will be merged with and into Access
(the “Merger”), in accordance with the provisions of Virginia law, and with the effect specified in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (the “VSCA”). The separate corporate existence of Middleburg thereupon shall cease, and Access will be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (Access as existing on and after the Effective Date is sometimes referred to herein as the
“Continuing Corporation” whenever reference is made to it as of the Effective Date or thereafter). The Merger shall become effective
on such date and time as may be determined in accordance with Section 1.2 of the Agreement (the “Effective Date”). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall possess all rights, privileges,
properties, immunities, powers and franchises of Middleburg, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims, restrictions and duties
of Middleburg shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims, restrictions and duties of the Continuing Corporation.

ARTICLE 2

2.1 Conversion of Shares.

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Access or Middleburg or the holder of any of
the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of Access (“Access Common Stock”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Middleburg (“Middleburg Common Stock”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Access or Middleburg (other than shares of
Middleburg Common Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and similar accounts,
or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties) (any such shares, the “Middleburg
Cancelled Shares”) shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Access or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Subject to Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, each share of Middleburg Common Stock, except for Middleburg Cancelled
Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into and
exchanged for the right to receive 1.3314 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of the Continuing Corporation (“Continuing Corporation Common Stock”) (together, with
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Plan of
Merger, the “Merger Consideration”).

Table of Contents

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Date, the outstanding shares of Access Common Stock or Middleburg Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in capitalization, appropriate and proportionate
adjustments shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Date, Access shall appoint an exchange and paying agent reasonably
acceptable to Middleburg (the “Exchange Agent”) for the payment and exchange of the Merger Consideration.

(b) Access to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective Date, Access shall for the benefit of holders of
shares of Middleburg Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article II in lieu of
fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, and (ii) duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent of non-
certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to this Article 2.

(c) Distributions to Holders of Middleburg Common Stock. Upon the Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding share of
Middleburg Common Stock who has properly surrendered such Certificates (as defined herein) or non-certificated shares represented
by book-entry registry of Middleburg Common Stock (the “Book-Entry Shares”) to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
such certificates) will be entitled to evidence of issuance in book entry form the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock (except if such holder has made an election to receive a physical stock certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(d) of this
Agreement) and the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of shares of Middleburg Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger. If a
holder of Middleburg Common Stock surrenders such Certificates representing shares of Middleburg Common Stock (the
“Certificates”) or Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at least five (5) business days
prior to the Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, within two
(2) business days following the Effective Date, to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the consideration into which the shares of
such Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger. If a holder of Middleburg Common Stock
surrenders such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at any time after
five (5) business days prior to the Effective Date, then Access shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent
to promptly, but in no event later than five (5) business days following receipt of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly
executed letter of transmittal, deliver to such holder of Middleburg Common Stock the consideration into which the shares of such
Middleburg Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver
the consideration to which any former holder of Middleburg Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders his or her Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 2.2. The Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall be, as applicable, duly endorsed or accompanied with such transfer and other documentation as the
Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this Plan of Merger notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of the Middleburg Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law.

(d) Letter of Transmittal. Access shall take all steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the
Effective Date, to mail to each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not previously surrendered such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of such Middleburg Common Stock have
been converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger. Such letter of transmittal shall permit each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
to elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock represented by book-entry registry, a physical stock
certificate representing shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to this Article II

(e) Lost Certificates. A holder of Middleburg Common Stock whose Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are
otherwise missing shall be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions to which such
shareholder shall be entitled upon compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation and the Exchange
Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance with the Continuing Corporation’s and the Exchange Agent’s standard
policy (including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond or other customary
indemnity).

Table of Contents

2.3 Rights of Former Holders of Middleburg Common Stock.

At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of Middleburg shall be closed as to holders of Middleburg Common Stock, and no
transfer of Middleburg Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the
Effective Date represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor. To the extent permitted by law, former holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the
Effective Date at any meeting of Continuing Corporation shareholders the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock into which their respective shares of Middleburg Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders
have surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by the Continuing Corporation on the Continuing Corporation Common Stock, the record
date for which is at or after the Effective Date, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable
pursuant to this Plan of Merger, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Middleburg Common Stock as
of any time subsequent to the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and
outstanding at the Effective Date until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in Section
2.2 of this Plan of Merger. However, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing Middleburg Common Stock
the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and
paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such Certificate.

2.4 Middleburg Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of Middleburg Common Stock (a “Middleburg Stock Option”) granted
under an equity or equity-based compensation plan of Middleburg (a “Middleburg Stock Plan”), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease, at the Effective Date, to represent a right to acquire
Middleburg Common Stock and shall be converted at the Effective Date, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into the
right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the difference between the closing sale price of Middleburg
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date and the per share
exercise price of the Middleburg Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Date, and (ii) the number of shares of Middleburg
Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Option, subject to any applicable withholdings. If the exercise price of a Middleburg
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Date is greater than the closing sale price of Middleburg Common Stock on the
NASDAQ Global Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date, then at the Effective Date such option shall be
cancelled without any payment made in exchange therefor. Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all commercially
reasonable actions to give effect to this Section 2.4(a) including, without limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
written consent from each holder of a Middleburg Stock Option to the cancellation of such Middleburg Stock Option in exchange for
the cash payment provided by this Section 2.4(a).

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Middleburg shall take all actions necessary to cause each Middleburg Stock Plan to terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Date.

(c) At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under a Middleburg Stock Plan (a “Middleburg Stock Award”)
which is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall fully vest and shall be converted into the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger, and the shares of Middleburg
Common Stock subject to such Middleburg Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of Middleburg Common
Stock for such purposes.

2.5 No Fractional Shares.

Each holder of shares of Middleburg Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger which would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest
and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
multiplied by the closing sale price of Access Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the trading day immediately
preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

2.6 Treasury Warrant.

At the Effective Date, each warrant to purchase Middleburg Common Stock originally issued to the United States Department of
the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement incorporated into the Letter

Table of Contents

Agreement, dated January 30, 2009, between Middleburg and the Treasury, including separate warrants derived therefrom, if any, (each
a “Treasury Warrant”), which is then outstanding and unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire Middleburg Common
Stock and shall be converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock in an amount and at an
exercise price determined in accordance with the terms of such Treasury Warrant.

2.7 Withholding Rights.

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Plan of Merger to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in the Agreement)
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined in the Agreement)
by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to such
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

ARTICLE 3
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation

The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Access as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date, will be the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation.

waived, of the conditions set forth in the Agreement.

receipt of the Middleburg Shareholder Approval (as defined in the Agreement) and the Access Shareholder Approval (as defined in the
Agreement), provided, however, that after either such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by applicable
law would require further approval by the holders of Access Common Stock or Middleburg Common Stock, including to effect any of
the changes listed in Section 13.1-716E of the VSCA.

October 21, 2016

The Board of Directors
Access National Corporation
1800 Robert Fulton Drive
Reston, Virginia 20191

Dear Members of the Board:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Access National Corporation (“Buyer”) of the
Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be issued and paid by Buyer pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
(the “Agreement”), dated as of October 21, 2016, by and between Buyer and Middleburg Financial Corporation (“Target”). Prior to the
Merger, Access National Bank, Reston Virginia (the “Buyer Subsidiary”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer and Middleburg
Bank, Middleburg Virginia (the “Target Subsidiary”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Target. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, Target will merge with and into Buyer (the “Merger”) and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $2.50 per
share (“Target Common Stock”), of Target (other than certain shares to be cancelled in accordance with the Agreement) will be
converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 1.3314 shares of Buyer common stock, par value $0.835 per share (“Buyer
Common Stock”) (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Bank
Merger Agreement (as defined in the Agreement), following the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the Target
Subsidiary will merge with and into the Buyer Subsidiary with the Buyer Subsidiary as the surviving bank (the “Bank Merger” and,
together with the Merger, the “Transaction”), and each share of capital stock of the Target Subsidiary will be automatically canceled
and no new cash, new shares of capital stock, or other property shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

In arriving at our opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate
under the circumstances. Among other things, we have:
 

 (i) reviewed the financial terms of the Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement;
 

 
(ii) reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Target and Buyer, and certain

other relevant historical business and financial information relating to Target and Buyer made available to us from published
sources and from Target and Buyer, including the public filings by Target and Buyer listed on the attached Schedule A;

 

 

(iii) reviewed certain financial forecasts for Target prepared and provided to us by the management of Target (the “Target
Financial Forecasts”), and adjustments thereto and extensions thereof prepared by the management of Buyer to take into
account certain projected cost savings and synergies, including the amount and timing thereof, expected by the management
of Buyer to result from the Transaction (as adjusted, the “Adjusted Target Financial Forecasts”);

 

 

(iv) reviewed certain publicly available consensus “street estimates” for Buyer affirmed to us by management of Buyer (the
“Buyer Consensus Projections”) and certain additional financial forecasts for Buyer provided to us by the management of
Buyer (the “Buyer Management Financial Forecasts” and, together with the Buyer Consensus Projections, the “Buyer
Financial Forecasts”);

 

 
(v) reviewed certain non-public internal financial information and other data relating to Buyer and Target that were provided to

us by the Company for the purpose of our analysis and accordingly on which basis we prepared our analysis;
 

 

(vi) met with certain members of the senior management of Target to discuss the business and prospects of Target, and with
certain members of the senior management of Buyer to discuss the business and prospects of Target and Buyer, and the
projected cost savings and synergies, including the amount and timing thereof, expected by the management of Buyer to
result from the Transaction, and relied on the statements made by such persons;

(vii) reviewed certain publicly available information with respect to certain other companies we believe to be generally relevant

in evaluating the businesses of Target and Buyer;
 

 
(viii) reviewed the publicly available financial terms of certain business combinations we believe to be generally relevant in

evaluating the financial terms of the Merger;
 

 (ix) reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Buyer Common Stock and Target Common Stock;
 

 
(x) reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the Transaction on Buyer based on the financial forecasts and estimates referred

to above relating to Target and Buyer; and
 

 
(xi) conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations and considered such other financial, economic and

market criteria that we deemed relevant.

We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all data, material and other
information furnished, or otherwise made available, to us, discussed with or reviewed by us, or publicly available, and do not assume
any responsibility with respect to such data, material and other information. With respect to the Target Financial Forecasts,
management of Target has advised us, and we have assumed, that the Target Financial Forecasts have been reasonably prepared in good
faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Target with respect to the future
financial performance of Target. With respect to the Adjusted Target Financial Forecasts, management of Buyer has advised us, and we
have assumed, that the Adjusted Target Financial Forecasts have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Buyer with respect to the future financial performance of Target
following the consummation of the Transaction, after giving effect to the projected cost savings and synergies, including the amount
and timing thereof, expected by the management of Buyer to result from the Transaction. With respect to the Buyer Financial
Forecasts, the management of Buyer has advised us, and we have assumed, that the Buyer Consensus Projections are reasonable and
achievable, and that the Buyer Management Financial Forecasts have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Buyer, in each case with respect to the future financial
performance of Buyer. We have relied without independent verification upon the assessment of the management of Buyer with respect
to the timing and risks associated with the integration of the businesses of Buyer and Target and the risks associated with Buyer’s and
Target’s current and contemplated products, services and business models. We express no view or opinion with respect to the Target
Financial Forecasts, the Adjusted Target Financial Forecasts, the Buyer Financial Forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based
including, without limitation, the projected cost savings and synergies expected by Buyer management to result from the Transaction,
which cost savings and synergies we have, at your direction, assumed will be achieved in the amounts and at the times indicated
thereby. You have advised us and we have assumed without undertaking any responsibility for the independent verification thereof, that
the Adjusted Target Financial Forecasts, the Buyer Financial Forecasts and the assumptions on which they are based are a reasonable
basis on which to evaluate Target, Buyer and the proposed Transaction and, at your direction, we have used and relied upon the
Adjusted Target Financial Forecasts and the Buyer Financial Forecasts for purposes of our analyses and this opinion. We have also
relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of Target or Buyer since the dates of the most recent financial statements and
other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our analyses or this opinion, and that there is no
information or any facts or developments that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading. We also
have assumed, with your consent, that (i) in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements in
connection with the Transaction (which we assume will be obtained), no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on Target, Buyer or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction; (ii) the representations and warranties
made by the parties in the Agreement are accurate and complete in all respects material to our analyses and this opinion; (iii) each party
to the Agreement will perform in all material respects all of its covenants and obligations thereunder; (iv) the Transaction will be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or
provision thereof that is material to our analyses or this opinion; and (v) the Transaction will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have also

assumed that the Merger Agreement and Bank Merger Agreement, when executed by the relevant parties thereto, will conform to the
drafts of such agreements and other documents reviewed by us in all respects material to our analyses.

This opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Buyer of the Merger Consideration to be issued and
paid by Buyer in respect of the outstanding shares of Target Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to the Agreement and does not
address any other aspect or implication of the Transaction or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection
therewith or otherwise, including, without limitation, the form or, except to the extent expressly provided herein, the amounts of the
Merger Consideration to be issued and paid in the Merger; the allocation of the outstanding Buyer Shares after giving effect to the
Transaction as between the current holders of Buyer Shares and the current holders of Target Common Stock or any individual
members or groups thereof; the dilutive or other effects of the Transaction on the existing holders of Buyer Shares; the solvency or fair
value of Buyer, Target or any other entity or person or their respective assets or liabilities under any laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters; any tax implications of the Transaction to Buyer or its security holders or any
other party; the fairness of any portion or aspect of the Transaction to the current holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Buyer, Target or to any other party; or the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any
compensation or consideration to be received by or otherwise payable to any officers, directors, employees, securityholders or affiliates
of any party to the Transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to Target’s shareholders or
otherwise.

We are not expressing any opinion or providing any advice, counsel or interpretation, with respect to matters that require legal,
regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. We have assumed that any such opinions, advice, counsel or
interpretations have been or will be obtained by Buyer from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, we have, with your
consent, relied upon the assessments by Buyer and its other advisors as to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance and tax matters
with respect to Buyer, Target and the Transaction.

This opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and
other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof. Although subsequent developments may affect this opinion, we
assume no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. As you are aware, the credit, financial and stock markets may
experience significant volatility. We express no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on Buyer, the Buyer
Subsidiary, Target, the Target Subsidiary or the Transaction. This opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might be available to Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiary, Target, the Target Subsidiary
or any other party to the Transaction, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Board of Directors of Buyer (the
“Board”), the Buyer Subsidiary, Target, the Target Subsidiary or any other party to proceed with the Transaction. Furthermore, in
connection with this opinion, we have not been requested to make, and have not made, any physical inspection or independent
appraisal or evaluation of any of the assets, properties or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiary, Target, the
Target Subsidiary or any other party, nor were we provided with any such appraisal or evaluation. In addition, we have not received or
reviewed any individual credit files nor have we made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiary, Target, the Target Subsidiary or any of
their respective subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We are not experts in the
evaluation of loan, lease, investment or trading portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for losses with
respect thereto and, accordingly, we have assumed that such allowances for losses are adequate to cover such losses. We do not express
any opinion as to what the value of Buyer Shares actually will be when issued pursuant to the Merger, or the price or range of prices at
which Buyer Common Stock or Target Common Stock may be purchased or sold at any time. With your consent, we have assumed that
the Buyer Shares to be issued in the Merger will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.

FBR Capital Markets & Co. (“FBRC”) has acted as financial advisor to Buyer in connection with the Transaction and will receive
a fee for its services, which is contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. We will also receive a fee for rendering
this opinion, which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. In

addition, Buyer has also agreed to indemnify us and certain related parties for certain liabilities arising out of or related to our
engagement and to reimburse us for certain expenses incurred in connection with our engagement. Other than this engagement, during
the two years preceding the date of this opinion, FBRC has not had any material relationship with any party to the Transaction for
which compensation has been received or is intended to be received, nor is any such material relationship or related compensation
mutually understood to be contemplated. 

We are a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as providing investment banking
and other financial services. In the ordinary course of business, we and our affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for our and our affiliates
own accounts and the accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments (including bank loans and other
obligations) of Buyer, Target, certain of their affiliates and any other company that may be involved in the Transaction. We and our
affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Buyer, Target and certain of their respective
affiliates, for which we and our affiliates would expect to receive compensation. FBRC has adopted policies and procedures designed
to preserve the independence of its research and credit analysts whose views may differ from those of the members of the team of
investment banking professionals that are advising Buyer.

In the past two years, we have not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to Buyer (other than in connection
with the Merger) or Target. It is understood that this opinion is solely for the information of the Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its consideration of the proposed Merger. This opinion may not be quoted or referred to, in whole or in part, filed with,
or furnished or disclosed to any other party, or used for any other purpose, without our prior written consent, except as described in the
remainder of this paragraph. If and to the extent required by law or regulation, this opinion and a summary thereof and references
thereto may be included in documents to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided that any such summary or
reference language shall also be subject to the prior written approval by FBRC. This opinion has been reviewed and approved by our
Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

This opinion is not intended to and should not be construed as creating any fiduciary duty on the part of FBRC to the Board,
Buyer, Target, any security holder of Buyer or any other party. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board, Buyer,
Target, any securityholder of Buyer or any other person as to how to act or vote on any matter relating to the Transaction or otherwise.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be issued and
paid by Buyer pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Buyer.
 

Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Middleburg Financial Corporation (the “Company”) and Access National Corporation (“Access”) are proposing to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Access, with
Access being the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, at the Effective Date, each share of
common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Date, except for certain shares of Company Common Stock as specified in the Agreement, will be converted into the right
to receive 1.3314 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.835 per share, of Access (“Access Common
Stock”). Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. The terms and
conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement. You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to the holders of Company Common Stock.

Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (“Sandler O’Neill”, “we” or “our”), as part of its investment banking business, is regularly
engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate
transactions. In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed and considered, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement, dated
October 19, 2016; (ii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of the Company that we
deemed relevant; (iii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Access that we
deemed relevant; (iv) certain financial projections for the Company for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017
and estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for the Company, as provided by the respective
senior managements of the Company and Access, that were prepared by such senior managements to reflect the Company’s recent
financial performance and that we have been directed by the Company to rely upon and utilize for purposes of our analysis and this
opinion; (v) mean publicly available analyst estimates for Access for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2018, as well as estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for Access, as
provided by the senior management of Access; (vi) the pro forma financial impact of the Merger on Access based on certain
assumptions relating to purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management
of Access; (vii) the relative contribution of assets, liabilities, equity and earnings of Company and Access to the combined entity; (viii)
the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for Company Common Stock and Access Common Stock, including a
comparison of certain stock market information for Company Common Stock and Access Common Stock and certain stock indices as
well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; (ix) a comparison
of certain financial information for the Company and Access with similar institutions for which information is publicly available; (x)
the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry on a nationwide basis, to the extent publicly
available; (xi) the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and (xii) such other information,
financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria as we considered relevant. We also discussed
with certain members of the senior management of the Company the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects
of the Company and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior management of Access regarding the business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Access.

In performing our review, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that
was available to and reviewed by us from public sources, that was provided to us by the Company or Access or their respective
representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by us, and we have assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering
this opinion without any independent verification or investigation. We have relied on the assurances of the respective managements of
the Company and Access that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information inaccurate or
misleading. We have not been asked to and have not undertaken an independent verification of any of such information and we do not
assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

We did not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Access or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor have we been furnished with any such
evaluations or appraisals. We render no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets or the future performance of any loans
of the Company or Access. We did not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of the
Company or Access, or of the combined entity after the Merger, and we have not reviewed any individual credit files relating to the
Company or Access. We have assumed, with your consent, that the respective allowances for loan losses for both the Company and
Access are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used certain financial projections for the Company for the years ending December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2017 and estimated long-term annual earnings growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for the Company,
as provided by the respective senior managements of the Company and Access, as well as mean publicly available analyst estimates for
Access for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and estimated long-term annual earnings
growth rate, dividend and other assumptions for Access, as provided by the senior management of Access. Sandler O’Neill also
received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and
transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management of Access. With respect to the foregoing information, the respective senior
managements of the Company and Access confirmed to us that such information reflected (or, in the case of the mean publicly
available analyst estimates referred to above, were consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of those
respective senior managements as to the future financial performance of the Company and Access, respectively, and the other matters
covered thereby, and we assumed that the future financial performance reflected in such information would be achieved. We express no
opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which such information is based. We have also assumed that there has been no
material change in the respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company or Access
since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to us. We have assumed in all respects material to our analysis that
the Company and Access will remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to our analysis.

We have also assumed, with your consent, that (i) each of the parties to the Agreement will comply in all material respects with
all material terms and conditions of the Agreement and all related agreements, that all of the representations and warranties contained
in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to such agreements will perform in all material
respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that the
conditions precedent in such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third
party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on the Company, Access or the Merger or any related transaction, (iii) the Merger and any related
transactions will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of
any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements, and (iv) the
Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Finally, with your consent, we have relied upon the
advice that the Company has received from its legal, accounting and tax advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement. We express no opinion as to any such matters.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect this opinion. We have not
undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date hereof. We
express no opinion as to the trading values of Company Common Stock or Access Common Stock at any time or what the value of
Access Common Stock will be once it is actually received by the holders of Company Common Stock.

We have acted as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion,
which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the portion of the transaction fee which will become payable to Sandler O’Neill on
the day of closing of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain claims and liabilities arising out of our
engagement and to reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our engagement. In connection
with our engagement, we were not asked to, and did not, solicit indications of interest in a potential transaction with the Company from
other parties. In the two years preceding the date of this opinion,

we have provided certain other investment banking services to the Company and received fees for such services. Earlier this year, we
were engaged, and we continue to be engaged, as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Company’s strategic defense
planning and its Board of Directors’ consideration of alternative strategies. We have not provided any investment banking services to
Access in the two years preceding the date of this opinion. In the ordinary course of our business as a broker-dealer, we may purchase
securities from and sell securities to the Company and its affiliates. We may also actively trade the equity and debt securities of the
Company, Access and their respective affiliates for our own account and for the accounts of our customers.

Our opinion is directed to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Agreement and the
Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how any such shareholder should vote at
any meeting of shareholders called to consider and vote upon the approval of the Agreement and the Merger. Our opinion is directed
only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to the holders of Company Common Stock and does not
address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, the form or structure of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated in the Agreement, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or
business strategies that might exist for the Company or the effect of any other transaction in which the Company might engage. We
also do not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the Merger by any
officer, director or employee of the Company or Access, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the compensation to be
received in the Merger by any other shareholder. This opinion has been approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion
committee. This opinion shall not be reproduced without Sandler O’Neill’s prior written consent; provided, however, Sandler O’Neill
will provide its consent for the opinion to be included in regulatory filings to be completed in connection with the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair to holders of
Company Common Stock from a financial point of view.

Very truly yours,
/s/ Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P.
