MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear IXYS Corporation Stockholder:

          On August 25, 2017, IXYS Corporation (referred to as IXYS), Littelfuse, Inc. (referred to as Littelfuse) and Iron Merger Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse (referred to as Merger Sub), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger that provides for the acquisition of IXYS by Littelfuse (such agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of December 4, 2017, by and among IXYS, Littelfuse, Merger Sub and IXYS
Merger Co., LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse (referred to as Merger Sub Two), as it may be further amended from time to time, is referred to as the merger agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement,
Merger Sub will merge with and into IXYS (referred to as the initial merger), with IXYS continuing as the surviving corporation in the initial merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. Further to the terms of the merger
agreement, IXYS, as the surviving corporation of the initial merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub Two (referred to as the follow-on merger, and collectively with the initial merger, the merger), with Merger Sub Two
continuing as the surviving company in the follow-on merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. The respective boards of directors of IXYS and Littelfuse have unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

          Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the initial merger (referred to as the effective time), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of IXYS that you own
immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, at your election and subject to proration, (i) $23.00 in cash (subject to applicable withholding tax),
without interest (referred to as the cash consideration), or (ii) 0.1265 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Littelfuse (referred to as the stock consideration and together with the cash consideration, the merger
consideration). You will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock that you would otherwise be entitled to receive. Additionally, at the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
IXYS common stock granted under an IXYS equity plan will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into an option to acquire (i) a number of shares of Littelfuse common stock equal to the number of shares of IXYS common
stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by 0.1265, rounded down to the nearest whole share, with (ii) an exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock equal to the exercise price of such
IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time divided by 0.1265, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

          Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017, the last full trading day before the announcement of the merger, the per share value of IXYS common stock implied by the stock consideration
is $22.55. Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on December 11, 2017, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, the per share value implied by the
stock consideration is $24.90, which represents a premium of approximately 56% over IXYS' closing stock price on August 25, 2017. The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Littelfuse
common stock fluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Littelfuse common stock. As a result, the value of the stock consideration that IXYS stockholders will receive upon completion of
the merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the special meeting of the IXYS stockholders described in
the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus (referred to as the special meeting). Accordingly, you should obtain current stock price quotations for Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock before deciding how to vote
with respect to the approval of the merger proposal. Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock trade on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols "LFUS" and "IXYS," respectively.

          Based on the number of shares of Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock outstanding on December 6, 2017, upon completion of the merger, former IXYS stockholders will own approximately 8% of the
outstanding shares of Littelfuse common stock and Littelfuse stockholders immediately prior to the merger will own approximately 92% of the outstanding shares of Littelfuse common stock.

          The IXYS board of directors unanimously determined that the merger and the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of IXYS and its stockholders, and approved and declared it advisable to enter
into the merger agreement.

          At the special meeting, you will be asked to approve the merger proposal and to vote on other merger-related matters. The IXYS board of directors unanimously recommends that IXYS stockholders vote "FOR" the
merger proposal and "FOR" each of the other proposals described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

          Your vote is very important.    Littelfuse and IXYS cannot complete the merger without the approval of the merger proposal by IXYS stockholders holding at least a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock
outstanding at the close of business on December 6, 2017, the record date for the special meeting. The failure of any stockholder to vote will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger proposal. It
is important that your shares of IXYS common stock be represented and voted regardless of the size of your holdings. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, IXYS urges you to submit a proxy in
advance of the special meeting to have your shares voted by using one of the methods described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

          More information about Littelfuse, IXYS, the special meeting, the merger and the other proposals for consideration at the special meeting is contained in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. Please carefully read
the entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the section titled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32, for a discussion of the risks relating to the proposed merger, and the annexes and documents incorporated by
reference.

On behalf of the IXYS board of directors, thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,

Uzi Sasson
President and Chief Executive Officer

          NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE MERGER OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS
DESCRIBED IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS OR THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS NOR HAVE THEY DETERMINED IF THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS ACCURATE OR ADEQUATE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE
CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

          The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus is dated December 13, 2017 and is first being mailed to IXYS stockholders on or about December 13, 2017.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the special meeting.
These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as an IXYS stockholder. Please refer to the section titled "Summary" beginning on page
12 and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the annexes to this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents referred to in this
proxy statement/prospectus, which you should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus
without charge by following the instructions under the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 151.

Q:    Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?

A: IXYS Corporation (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as IXYS) is sending these materials to IXYS stockholders to help them decide how to vote their shares
of IXYS common stock with respect to the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 25, 2017, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of
December 4, 2017, by and among IXYS, Littelfuse, Inc. (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as Littelfuse), Iron Merger Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Littelfuse (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as Merger Sub), and IXYS Merger Co., LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as Merger Sub Two), which agreement provides for the acquisition of IXYS by Littelfuse (such agreement, as it may be further amended from time
to time, is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the merger agreement) and with respect to the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting of IXYS
stockholders to be held on January 12, 2018 (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the special meeting).

This document constitutes both a proxy statement of IXYS and a prospectus of Littelfuse. It is a proxy statement because IXYS is soliciting proxies from its stockholders.
It is a prospectus because Littelfuse will issue shares of its common stock in exchange for shares of IXYS common stock in the merger if the merger is completed.

Q:    What is the merger?

A: IXYS has agreed to be acquired by Littelfuse under the terms of the merger agreement, which is further described in this proxy statement/prospectus. If the merger
agreement is adopted by IXYS stockholders and the other conditions to closing under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into
IXYS (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the initial merger), with IXYS continuing as the surviving corporation in the initial merger and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Littelfuse. Further to the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS, as the surviving corporation of the initial merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub Two
(referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the follow-on merger, and collectively with the initial merger, the merger), with Merger Sub Two continuing as the
surviving company in the follow-on merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse.

The merger cannot be completed unless the merger proposal is approved by the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of IXYS common stock entitled to vote thereon. Your failing to submit a proxy or vote in person at the special meeting, or your abstaining from voting or your failing to
provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares, as applicable, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
merger proposal. The IXYS board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal. This proxy statement/prospectus includes
important information about the merger and the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A

to this proxy statement/prospectus. IXYS stockholders should read this information carefully and in its entirety.

Q:    Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the merger proposal?

A: Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section titled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32. You should also read and carefully consider
the risk factors of Littelfuse and IXYS contained in the documents that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:    What will IXYS stockholders receive for their shares if the merger is completed?

A: At the effective time of the initial merger (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the effective time), you will be entitled to receive, at your election and subject
to proration, for each share of IXYS common stock that you hold, merger consideration equal to $23.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes
(referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the cash consideration), or 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus
as the stock consideration and together with the cash consideration, the merger consideration). The exchange ratio was derived by dividing the cash consideration of
$23.00 by the volume weighted average price per share of Littelfuse common stock for a pre-determined trading period prior to the signing of the merger agreement. You
will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock that you would otherwise be entitled to receive.

The merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into
cash consideration and the remaining IXYS common stock will be converted into stock consideration. You may elect to receive either the stock consideration or the cash
consideration. However, the ability to receive the merger consideration of your choice will depend on the election of other IXYS stockholders. The proration of the
merger consideration payable to IXYS stockholders in the merger will not be known until IXYS tallies the results of the elections made by IXYS stockholders, which will
not occur until immediately prior to or following the closing of the initial merger. Holders of IXYS common stock who do not make an election will be treated as having
elected to receive cash consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement.

Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017, the last full trading day before the announcement of the merger, the per share value of
IXYS common stock implied by the stock consideration is $22.55. Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on December 11, 2017, the most recent
practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the per share value of IXYS common stock implied by the stock consideration is $24.90. The implied
value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Littelfuse common stock fluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of
shares of Littelfuse common stock. As a result, the value of the stock consideration that IXYS stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger could be greater
than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the IXYS special meeting. Accordingly,
you should obtain current stock price quotations for Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to approval of the
merger proposal.

The following chart sets forth the implied value, per share of IXYS common stock, of the stock consideration based upon a range of hypothetical Littelfuse share prices,
from $150.00, which is approximately 20% less than the closing market price of one share of Littelfuse common stock on

December 6, 2017, to $230.00, which is approximately 20% greater than the closing market price of one share of Littelfuse common stock on December 6, 2017.

Implied Value, Per Share of IXYS Common Stock, of Stock Consideration
Based on Range of Hypothetical Littelfuse Share Prices(1) 

(1) The implied value, per share of IXYS common stock, of the stock consideration, at each hypothetical Littelfuse share price, is equal to 0.1265, the exchange ratio for the
stock consideration, multiplied by the hypothetical Littelfuse share price.

For additional information regarding the consideration to be received in the merger, see the section titled "The Merger—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 50.

See Note 4 in the section titled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" on page 122 for a table showing sensitivities with respect to the
aggregate purchase price, including the aggregate value of the stock consideration, for the acquisition of IXYS by Littelfuse based on changes in the market value per
share of Littelfuse common stock.

Q:    What happens if I am eligible to receive a fraction of a share of Littelfuse common stock as part of the stock consideration?

A: If the aggregate number of shares of Littelfuse common stock that you are entitled to receive as part of the stock consideration otherwise would include a fraction of a
share of Littelfuse common stock, you will receive cash in lieu of that fractional share. See the section titled "The Merger—Exchange of Shares; Elections As to Form of
Consideration" beginning on page 85.

Q:    What will holders of IXYS stock options receive in the merger?

A: At the effective time, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of IXYS common stock granted by IXYS under one of its equity plans (each, an IXYS
stock option) will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into an option (each, a Littelfuse stock option) to acquire (i) that number of whole shares of Littelfuse common
stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of IXYS common stock subject to such IXYS stock option immediately
prior to the effective time multiplied by (y) 0.1265, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal

Table of Contents

to the quotient of (x) the exercise price per share of IXYS common stock of such IXYS stock option divided by (y) 0.1265. Each IXYS stock option assumed and
converted into a Littelfuse stock option will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting schedule (including any accelerated vesting terms) and all other
terms and conditions as applied to such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time.

See the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of IXYS Equity Awards" beginning on page 95.

Q:    How will IXYS stockholders make their election to receive either the cash consideration or the stock consideration in the merger?

A: An election form will be mailed to each holder of record of IXYS common stock as of the business day immediately preceding the mailing. The mailing will occur at
least 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline, which is expected to be 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the exchange
agent is located) on the date Littelfuse and IXYS expect to be two business days before the closing date. Littelfuse will also make an election form available to each IXYS
stockholder who requests such form before the election deadline. Each IXYS stockholder should complete and return the election form, along with IXYS stock
certificate(s) (or a properly completed notice of guaranteed delivery, as set forth in the election form), according to the instructions included with the form. The election
form will be provided to IXYS stockholders under separate cover and is not being provided with this document.

If you own shares of IXYS common stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to make an election, you should seek instructions from
the bank, broker or other nominee holding your shares concerning how to make an election. If you do not send in the election form with your stock certificate(s) by the
election deadline, you will be treated as though you had not made an election.

Q:    What happens if an IXYS stockholder does not make a valid election to receive either the cash consideration or the stock consideration?

A: If an IXYS stockholder does not return a properly completed election form by the election deadline specified in the election form, such stockholder's shares of IXYS
common stock will be considered "non-election" shares and will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration or the cash consideration according to the
allocation procedures specified in the merger agreement. Generally, in the event one form of merger consideration (i.e., cash or shares of Littelfuse common stock) is
undersubscribed, shares of IXYS common stock for which no election was validly made will be allocated to that form of merger consideration before shares of IXYS
common stock electing the oversubscribed form of merger consideration will be allocated to the undersubscribed form of merger consideration pursuant to the proration
and adjustment procedures. Accordingly, although electing one form of merger consideration will not guarantee you will receive that form of merger consideration for all
of your shares of IXYS common stock, in the event proration is necessary, electing shares will be allocated the undersubscribed form of consideration only after such
consideration is allocated to "non-election" shares.

Q:    How will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled?

A: After receiving the proper documentation from you, following completion of the initial merger, the exchange agent for the merger (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the exchange agent) will forward to you the stock consideration and/or cash consideration to which you are entitled. More information on the
documentation you are required to deliver to the exchange

agent may be found in the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures" beginning on page 93.

Q:    What will happen to IXYS as a result of the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, IXYS, as the surviving corporation of the initial merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two continuing as the
surviving company in the follow-on merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. As a result of the merger, IXYS will no longer be a publicly held company.
Following the merger, IXYS common stock will be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Q:    Will the Littelfuse common stock received at the time of completion of the merger be traded on an exchange?

A: It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that the shares of Littelfuse common stock to be issued to IXYS stockholders in the merger be approved for listing on
The NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

Q:    When is the merger expected to be completed?

A: Littelfuse and IXYS currently expect the merger to be completed during the first quarter of calendar year 2018, subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to closing contained
in the merger agreement. However, Littelfuse and IXYS cannot predict the actual date on which the merger will be completed because completion is subject to conditions
beyond their control and it is possible that such conditions could result in the merger being completed earlier or later or not being completed at all. See the sections titled
"The Merger—Regulatory Approvals" beginning on page 84 and "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 108.

Q:    What am I being asked to vote on?

A: IXYS stockholders are being asked to vote upon the following proposals: 

1. Proposal 1—The Merger Proposal:    the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections titled "The Merger" beginning on
page 50 and "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 88 and a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A; 

2. Proposal 2—The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal:    the proposal to approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to IXYS' named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger; and 

3. Proposal 3—The Adjournment Proposal:    the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
not sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal.

Q:    How does the IXYS board of directors recommend that I vote at the special meeting?

A: The IXYS board of directors unanimously recommends that IXYS stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal and "FOR" each of the other proposals described in this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:    What do I need to do now?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, please submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your shares of
IXYS common stock will be represented and voted at the special meeting. Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form
provided by the record holder if your shares are held in "street name" by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

Q:    Should I send in my IXYS stock certificates now?

A: No. Please do not send in your IXYS stock certificates with your proxy. You should submit your IXYS stock certificates with your election form. Any IXYS stockholder
who has not submitted its, his or her physical stock certificate(s) with a form of election will be sent materials after the merger closes to effect the exchange of such
stockholder's IXYS common stock for the merger consideration. See "The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures."

Q:    When and where is the special meeting of the IXYS stockholders?

A: The special meeting will be held on January 12, 2018, beginning at 9:00 a.m., local time, at IXYS' principal executive offices at 1590 Buckeye Drive, Milpitas, California
95035, unless postponed to a later date.

Q:    Who can vote at the special meeting?

A: Only IXYS stockholders who held shares of record as of the close of business on December 6, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice
of and to vote at the special meeting. IXYS' official stock ownership records will conclusively determine whether a stockholder is a "holder of record" as of the record
date.

Q:    How many votes do I have?

A: Each IXYS stockholder is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the special meeting for each share of IXYS common stock held of record as of the
close of business on the record date. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 32,935,335 shares of IXYS common stock outstanding and owned by
stockholders (i.e., excluding shares of IXYS common stock held in treasury by IXYS), held by 216 holders of record.

Q:    What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?

A: The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock as of the record date entitled to
vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the special meeting. The Inspector of Elections at the special meeting will determine whether or not a
quorum is present. Abstentions are considered present for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not be counted as votes cast "FOR" any matter. Broker non-votes
are considered present for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not be counted as votes cast "FOR" any matter.

Q:    What vote is required to approve each proposal to be considered at the IXYS special meeting?

A: The votes required for each proposal are as follows: 

1. The Merger Proposal:    The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock entitled to vote on
the merger proposal is required to approve the merger proposal.

2. The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-
related compensation proposal. 

3. The Adjournment Proposal:    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal.

As of December 6, 2017, the record date, IXYS directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote 6,917,562 shares of IXYS common stock, or
approximately 21.0% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock. IXYS currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor
of the merger proposal and each of the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus, although none of them, other than Dr. Nathan Zommer, has entered
into any agreement obligating them to do so.

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of Dr. Nathan Zommer (the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IXYS) and certain of his
controlled affiliates entered into a letter agreement with Littelfuse (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the voting agreement) pursuant to which each party
agreed, among other things, to vote the shares of IXYS common stock held by such party in favor of the merger proposal. See the section titled "The Voting Agreement"
beginning on page 113.

As of December 6, 2017, the record date, approximately 20.5% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock were subject to the voting agreement, a copy of which is
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B.

Q:    How are proxies counted and what results from a failure to vote, abstention or broker non-vote?

A: The Merger Proposal:    If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and take any action other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted) "FOR" the merger
proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote,
it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal:    If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and attend the IXYS special meeting in person but fail to vote, or you
are a stockholder and mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger-related compensation proposal. If
you are an IXYS stockholder and fail to vote by not attending the IXYS special meeting, in person or by proxy, or you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

The Adjournment Proposal:    If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and attend the IXYS special meeting in person but fail to vote, or you are a stockholder
and mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adjournment proposal. If you are an IXYS stockholder and
fail to vote by not attending the IXYS special meeting, in person or by proxy, or you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it will have no
effect on the adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

Q:    What will happen if the merger-related compensation proposal is not approved?

A: The merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only and not binding on IXYS or Littelfuse, whether or not the merger is completed. The vote on the merger-
related compensation proposal is separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement and not a condition to the

completion of the merger. If the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation that is the subject of this proposal may be paid to IXYS' named executive officers
in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the stockholders fail to approve this proposal.

Q:    How do I vote or have my shares voted?

A: If you are an IXYS stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting or vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card. Whether or not you plan to
attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by
proxy. 

• To vote in person, come to the special meeting and we will give you a ballot when you arrive. 

• To vote using the proxy card, simply complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the envelope provided. If you return your signed
proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct. 

• To vote by telephone, submit your proxy by dialing the following number: 1-800-652-VOTE (8683). Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be

person at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. Follow the instructions from the nominee included with
these proxy materials, or contact the nominee to request a proxy form.

Q:    How will my proxy be voted?

A: If you are a holder of record and submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, your shares
will be voted in accordance with your instructions contained in the proxy. If you are a holder of record and submit your proxy without specifying how your shares should
be voted in one or more matters, your shares will be voted on those matters as the IXYS board of directors recommends.

If you are a non-record owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to vote your shares.

Q:    What must I bring to attend the special meeting?

A: Only stockholders of record as of the record date, non-record owners as of the record date, holders of valid proxies for the special meeting and invited guests of IXYS
may attend the special meeting. All attendees should be prepared to present picture identification for admittance. The additional items, if any, that attendees must bring
depend on whether they are stockholders of record, non-record owners or proxy holders.

prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of IXYS common stock will be represented and voted at the special meeting if you are unable to attend. If you are a
non-record owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you. Please
note that if you are a non-record owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

Q:    If my shares are held in "street name" by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares for me?

A: No. If your shares are held in "street name" by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you must direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote
and you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee describing how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock. The availability of
Internet or telephonic voting will depend on the nominee's voting process. Please check with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and follow the voting
procedures your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee provides.

If you are a non-record owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock with
respect to a "non-routine" matter, a broker "non-vote" occurs with respect to those matters. Under applicable stock exchange rules, the organization that holds your shares
of IXYS common stock (i.e., your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee) may generally vote on routine matters at its discretion but cannot vote your shares on "non-
routine" matters without your instructions. If you are a non-record owner and the organization that holds your shares of IXYS common stock does not receive instructions
from you on how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock on a "non-routine" matter, the organization that holds your shares of IXYS common stock will inform the
inspector of elections that it does not have the authority to vote your shares on such matters. The merger proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal and the
adjournment proposal will be considered "non-routine." Accordingly, if you are a non-record owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
instructions on how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee generally will not be permitted to vote your shares on any of
the proposals at the special meeting. If you are a non-record owner, IXYS strongly encourages you to provide voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee so that your vote will be counted on all matters.

Q:    What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and in "street name"?

A: If your shares of IXYS common stock are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent of IXYS, Computershare Inc., you are considered the stockholder of
record with respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote or to grant a proxy for your vote directly to IXYS or to a third party to vote at
the special meeting.

If your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and, for the purposes of this
proxy statement/prospectus, a non-record owner, and your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If
you are a non-record owner, you have a right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote the shares held in your account. The availability of
Internet or telephonic voting will depend on the nominee's voting process. Please check with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and follow the voting
procedures your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee provides. You are invited to attend the special meeting; however, you may not vote your shares in person at the
special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the
special meeting.

Q:    What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting?

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or
voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your IXYS common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for
each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one
proxy card. Please submit each separate proxy or voting instruction card that you receive by following the instructions set forth in each separate proxy or voting
instruction card.

Q:    What do I do if I am an IXYS stockholder and I want to revoke my proxy?

A: IXYS stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the voting at the special meeting in any of the following ways: 

• submitting another properly completed proxy card with a later date; 

• sending timely written notice that you are revoking your proxy to IXYS Corporation's Secretary, Uzi Sasson, at 1590 Buckeye Drive, Milpitas, California 95035; 

• submitting a proxy via the Internet or by telephone at a later date but before the voting at the special meeting (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted
and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not, however, in and of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior
proxy.

IXYS non-record owners may change their voting instructions only by following the directions received from their bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for changing
their voting instructions.

Q:    What happens if I sell my shares of IXYS common stock before the special meeting?

A: The record date is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the closing of the merger. If you transfer your shares of IXYS common stock after the record date
but before the special meeting, you will, unless the transferee requests a proxy from you, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but will transfer the right to
receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares upon completion
of the merger.

Q:    Do IXYS stockholders have appraisal rights?

A: Yes. IXYS stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the DGCL), provided they follow the procedures and satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. For more information regarding
appraisal rights, see the section titled "Appraisal Rights of IXYS Stockholders" beginning on page 143. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as
Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL may result in your waiver of, or inability to, exercise appraisal
rights.

Q:    Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?

A: IXYS will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the special meeting. IXYS has engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting.
IXYS estimates that it will pay D.F. King a fee of approximately $10,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. IXYS will also reimburse banks, brokerage firms,
custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries who hold

shares for the benefit of another party for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and proxy materials to non-record owners of IXYS common stock. IXYS' directors,
officers and employees also may solicit proxies in person by telephone or over the Internet. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.

A: You can find more information about Littelfuse and IXYS from various sources described in the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on
page 151.

        The following summary highlights selected information described in more detail elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, and may not contain all the information that may be important to you. To understand the merger and the matters being
voted on by IXYS stockholders at the special meeting more fully, and to obtain a more complete description of the legal terms of the merger agreement, you should
carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes, and the documents to which Littelfuse and IXYS refer you. Each item in this summary includes

Table of Contents

IXYS Merger Co., LLC

        IXYS Merger Co., LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as Merger Sub Two), is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Littelfuse. Merger Sub Two was formed by Littelfuse solely in contemplation of the merger, has not conducted any business and has no assets, liabilities or obligations of
any nature other than in connection with the merger. The principal executive offices of Merger Sub Two are located at c/o Littelfuse, Inc., 8755 West Higgins Road,
Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60631, and its telephone number is (773) 628-1000.

The Merger and the Merger Agreement 

        (see pages 50 and 88)

        The terms and conditions of the merger are contained in the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. IXYS
encourages you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into IXYS, with IXYS continuing
as the surviving corporation in the initial merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. Further to the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS, as the surviving
corporation of the initial merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two continuing as the surviving company in the follow-on merger and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse.

Merger Consideration 

        (see page 50)

        At the effective time, each issued and outstanding share of IXYS common stock (other than shares (i) owned or held in treasury by IXYS or owned by Littelfuse or
Merger Sub (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as cancelled shares) or (ii) owned by stockholders that did not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and have validly made a demand for appraisal and not validly withdrawn such demand or otherwise lost their rights of appraisal with respect to such shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the
holder of such share and subject to proration, $23.00 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, or 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock
(which exchange ratio was derived by dividing the cash consideration of $23.00 by the volume weighted average price per share of Littelfuse common stock for a pre-
determined trading period prior to the signing of the merger agreement). No fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock will be issued in the merger, and holders of IXYS
common stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock.

        The merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted
into cash consideration and the remaining IXYS common stock will be converted into stock consideration, based on an exchange ratio of 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse
common stock for each share of IXYS common stock entitled to receive stock consideration. A holder of IXYS common stock who does not make an election will be
treated as having elected to receive cash consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement, which is described in
the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock—Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration" beginning on page 90.

        Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017, the last full trading day before the announcement of the merger, the per share value
of IXYS common stock implied by the stock consideration is $22.55. Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common

Table of Contents

stock on December 11, 2017, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the per share value of IXYS common stock implied by
the stock consideration is $24.90. The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Littelfuse common stock fluctuates because the stock
consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Littelfuse common stock. As a result, the value of the stock consideration that IXYS stockholders will receive upon
completion of the merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of
the IXYS special meeting. Accordingly, Littelfuse and IXYS encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock
before deciding how to vote with respect to approval of the merger proposal. Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock trade on The NASDAQ Global Select
Market under the symbols "LFUS" and "IXYS," respectively.

IXYS Special Meeting 

        (see page 41)

Purposes of the Special Meeting

        At the special meeting, IXYS stockholders will be asked to vote upon the following proposals:

• the merger proposal; 

• the merger-related compensation proposal; and 

• the adjournment proposal.

Record Date

        The record date for the determination of IXYS stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting is December 6, 2017. Only IXYS stockholders who
held shares of record as of the close of business on December 6, 2017 are entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting and any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting, as long as such shares remain outstanding on the date of the special meeting.

Required Vote

• The Merger Proposal:  The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock entitled to
vote on the merger proposal is required to approve the merger proposal. 

• The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal:  The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
merger-related compensation proposal. 

• The Adjournment Proposal:  The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal.

        As of December 6, 2017, the record date, IXYS directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote 6,917,562 shares of IXYS common
stock, or approximately 21.0% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock. IXYS currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their shares
in favor of approving the merger proposal and each of the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus, although none of them, other than Dr. Nathan
Zommer, has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so.

Table of Contents

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of Dr. Nathan Zommer (the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IXYS) and certain of his
controlled affiliates entered into the voting agreement with Littelfuse pursuant to which each party agreed, among other things, to vote the shares of IXYS common stock
held by such party in favor of the merger proposal. See the section titled "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 113.

        As of December 6, 2017, the record date, approximately 20.5% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock were subject to the voting agreement, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B.

How Proxies Are Counted; Failure to Vote; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        The Merger Proposal:    If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and take any action other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted) "FOR" the
merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to
vote, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal:    If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and attend the IXYS special meeting in person but fail to vote, or
you are a stockholder and mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger-related compensation proposal.
If you are an IXYS stockholder and fail to vote by not attending the IXYS special meeting, in person or by proxy, or you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

        The Adjournment Proposal:    If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and attend the IXYS special meeting in person but fail to vote, or you are a
stockholder and mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adjournment proposal. If you are an IXYS
stockholder and fail to vote by not attending the IXYS special meeting, in person or by proxy, or you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it
will have no effect on the adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

IXYS' Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of IXYS Board of Directors 

        (see page 56)

        After careful evaluation of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the IXYS board of directors unanimously determined that the
terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, IXYS and its stockholders, and that it is in the best interests of IXYS and
its stockholders, and declared it advisable, for IXYS to enter into the merger agreement.

        The IXYS board of directors unanimously recommends that IXYS stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, and "FOR" each of the other proposals
described in this proxy statement/prospectus.

        In the course of reaching its recommendation, the IXYS board of directors consulted with IXYS' senior management and financial advisor, Needham &
Company, LLC (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as Needham & Company) and outside legal counsel and considered a number of factors. See the section
titled "The Merger—IXYS' Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of IXYS Board of Directors" beginning on page 56.

Opinion of IXYS' Financial Advisor

Table of Contents

        In connection with the merger, on August 25, 2017, Needham & Company delivered its oral opinion, which it subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of such date,
and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the consideration of $23.00 in cash or 0.1265 of
a share of Littelfuse common stock per share of IXYS common stock to be received by the holders of IXYS common stock (other than the holders of cancelled shares and
dissenting shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Needham & Company's written opinion, dated August 25, 2017, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. Needham & Company provided its opinion to the IXYS board of directors for the information
and assistance of the IXYS board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purpose of the IXYS board of directors' evaluation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Needham & Company's opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger, or any related
transaction, and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of IXYS as to whether that stockholder should elect to receive the cash consideration
or the stock consideration, or make no such election, or how that stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the merger.

Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        (see page 75)

        When considering the recommendation of the IXYS board of directors with respect to the merger proposal and the merger-related compensation proposal, you should
be aware that IXYS' directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of IXYS stockholders more generally.
The IXYS board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and considered them in deciding to recommend that IXYS
stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal and the merger-related compensation proposal. These interests include, among others, the rights to accelerated vesting of
stock options and certain payments and benefits in connection with the merger and/or a qualifying termination of employment following the merger, as described in more
detail in the section titled "The Merger—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 75.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

        (see page 80)

        The initial merger and the follow-on merger, taken together, are intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the Code). The completion of the initial merger and the follow-on merger is
conditioned upon the delivery by each of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (or other nationally recognized outside counsel), counsel to Littelfuse, and Latham &
Watkins LLP (or other nationally recognized outside counsel), counsel to IXYS, of its opinion to the effect that the initial merger and the follow-on merger, taken together,
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If the initial merger and the follow-on merger, taken together, qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to IXYS stockholders who are U.S. holders (as defined in the
section titled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences") and receive stock consideration and/or cash consideration in exchange for their shares of IXYS common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement generally will be as follows:

• if an IXYS stockholder receives solely cash consideration in exchange for such stockholder's shares of IXYS common stock, such stockholder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to

Table of Contents

the difference between the amount of cash consideration received and the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered;

• if an IXYS stockholder receives solely stock consideration in exchange for such stockholder's shares of IXYS common stock, such stockholder generally
will not recognize any gain or loss, except in respect of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock; and 

• if an IXYS stockholder receives a combination of stock consideration and cash consideration (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share of Littelfuse
common stock) pursuant to the merger, such stockholder generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the
amount of cash consideration and the fair market value of the stock consideration received, minus such stockholder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of
IXYS common stock surrendered and (2) the amount of cash consideration received.

        Each IXYS stockholder should read the discussion under the section titled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" and should consult his, her or its own
tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to such stockholder.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger 

        (see page 80)

        Littelfuse prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as GAAP). The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Littelfuse will be treated as the acquiror for accounting
purposes.

Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger 

        (see pages 84 and 109)

        Littelfuse, IXYS and Merger Sub have each agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable laws to consummate the merger and obtain (and to cooperate with each other in
obtaining) the required regulatory approvals, as described in the section titled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals" beginning on page 84.

        The obligations of Littelfuse and IXYS to consummate the merger were subject to, among other matters, the termination or expiration of the waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act and the receipt of the clearances and approvals applicable to the merger under the antitrust/merger control
laws of Germany. On October 2, 2017, Littelfuse and IXYS received early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in the United States, and on
October 6, 2017, Littelfuse and IXYS received the required German clearance. There are no other known regulatory approvals required before the closing of the merger.

Expected Timing of Merger 

        Littelfuse and IXYS currently expect the merger to be completed during the first quarter of calendar year 2018, subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to closing
contained in the merger agreement. However, Littelfuse and IXYS cannot predict the actual date on which the merger will be completed because completion is subject to
conditions beyond their control and it is possible that such conditions could result in the merger being completed earlier or later or not being completed at all. See the

Merger—Regulatory Approvals" beginning on page 84 and "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 108.

Treatment of IXYS Stock Options 

        (see pages 75 and 95)

        At the effective time, each outstanding and unexercised IXYS stock option will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into a Littelfuse stock option to acquire
(i) that number of whole shares of Littelfuse common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of IXYS common
stock subject to such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (y) 0.1265, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (x) the exercise price per share of IXYS common stock of such IXYS stock option divided by (y) 0.1265.
Each IXYS stock option assumed and converted into a Littelfuse stock option will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting schedule (including any
accelerated vesting terms) and all other terms and conditions as applied to such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time.

Listing of Littelfuse Common Stock; Delisting of IXYS Common Stock 

        (see page 87)

        It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that the shares of Littelfuse common stock to be issued to IXYS stockholders in the merger be approved for listing
on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance. As a result of the merger, shares of IXYS common stock will cease to be listed on The
NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Appraisal Rights 

        (see page 143)

        IXYS stockholders who do not vote in favor of approval of the merger proposal, who continuously hold their shares of IXYS common stock through the effective
time and who otherwise comply precisely with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of
IXYS common stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the merger is completed. The "fair value" of your shares of IXYS common stock as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive
under the terms of the merger agreement. IXYS stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise IXYS by submitting a
written demand for appraisal in the form described in this proxy statement/prospectus prior to the vote to approve the merger proposal, and must otherwise follow the
procedures prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of IXYS common stock held of record in the name of another person,
such as a nominee or intermediary, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized in this proxy statement/prospectus and in a timely manner
to perfect appraisal rights.

        The text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their
entirety. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising appraisal rights, IXYS stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel and their financial advisors. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in the loss of appraisal rights.

No Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals

Table of Contents

        As more fully described in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the exceptions summarized below, IXYS has agreed that it
will not (1) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
company takeover proposal (as defined on page 102), (2) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any company takeover
proposal, or (3) approve, recommend, or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend, or enter into, any agreement with respect to a company takeover proposal.

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval by IXYS stockholders of the merger proposal, IXYS receives a written, bona fide,
unsolicited company takeover proposal that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement and that the IXYS board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its advisors) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a company superior proposal (as defined on page 102), IXYS may (1) furnish
information with respect to IXYS to the party making the company takeover proposal (subject to certain conditions and obligations in the merger agreement) and
(2) engage in discussions or negotiations with the party making the company takeover proposal.

        IXYS has agreed to notify Littelfuse within one business day of the receipt of any company takeover proposal or any request for information that is reasonably likely
to lead to a company takeover proposal, or of any determination by the IXYS board of directors that a company takeover proposal constitutes or would be reasonably
expected to lead to a company superior proposal. IXYS has also agreed to keep Littelfuse reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of any
company takeover proposal, and to promptly provide Littelfuse with any draft agreements relating to a company takeover proposal.

Changes in Board Recommendation 

        (see page 103)

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the IXYS board of directors will not (i) fail to include its recommendation in favor of the merger
proposal in this proxy statement/prospectus, (ii) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify (in
each case in a manner adverse to Littelfuse) its recommendation in favor of the merger proposal, or (iii) adopt, approve or recommend to IXYS stockholders, or publicly
propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or recommend to IXYS stockholders, any company takeover proposal or agreement relating to a company takeover
proposal (any of the foregoing, an adverse recommendation change). Notwithstanding these restrictions, at any time prior to obtaining the approval by IXYS stockholders
of the merger proposal, the IXYS board of directors may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that a company takeover proposal is a company
superior proposal (and subject to compliance with certain obligations set forth in the merger agreement, including providing Littelfuse with prior notice and the right under
certain circumstances to negotiate to match the terms of any company superior proposal), make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement in
order to enter into a binding agreement with respect to the company superior proposal.

        In addition, the IXYS board of directors is permitted under certain circumstances, prior to obtaining the approval by IXYS stockholders of the merger proposal and
subject to compliance with certain obligations set forth in the merger agreement (including providing Littelfuse with prior notice and the right under certain circumstances
to negotiate to amend the terms of the merger agreement) to make an adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event (as defined on page 104) if the
IXYS board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger 

        (see page 108)

        The obligations of each of IXYS and Littelfuse to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

• the approval by IXYS stockholders of the merger proposal; 

• the SEC having declared effective the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part; 

• the absence of any order, law or legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that prohibits, enjoins or makes illegal the
closing of the merger; 

• the expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act and the receipt of the
clearances and approvals applicable to the merger under the antitrust/merger control laws of Germany; 

• the approval for listing by the NASDAQ Global Select Market of the shares of Littelfuse common stock to be issued to IXYS stockholders in the initial
merger; 

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the merger agreement, subject to the materiality standards set forth in the
merger agreement; 

• the other party having performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement; and 

• the receipt of a written tax opinion from each party's counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such party.

        In addition, Littelfuse's obligations to effect the merger are subject to IXYS' repayment of all of its outstanding debt obligations and delivery to Littelfuse of evidence
of such repayment.

        Neither Littelfuse nor IXYS can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        (see page 109)

        Littelfuse and IXYS may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement before completing the merger, whether before or after the receipt of IXYS stockholder
approval of the merger proposal.

        Either Littelfuse or IXYS may terminate the merger agreement, whether before or after the receipt of IXYS stockholder approval of the merger proposal:

• if the merger has not been consummated by February 28, 2018 (which deadline may be extended, under certain circumstances, to May 28, 2018); 

• if IXYS stockholders fail to approve the merger proposal; 

• if a court or other governmental entity issues a final, nonappealable order or adopts or enacts a law that in either case permanently restrains, enjoins or
makes illegal the consummation of the merger; or 

• if the other party breaches the merger agreement in a way that would entitle the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement not to consummate the
merger, subject to the rights of the breaching party to cure the breach.

Table of Contents

        IXYS may also terminate the merger agreement, prior to the receipt of IXYS stockholder approval of the merger proposal, in order to enter into an agreement for a
company superior proposal, provided that IXYS has complied with its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement and pays a termination fee of $28.5 million
to Littelfuse prior to or concurrently with such termination.

        Littelfuse may also terminate the merger agreement, prior to the receipt of IXYS stockholder approval of the merger proposal, if IXYS has made an adverse
recommendation change or if IXYS is in willful breach of its non-solicitation obligations. Following such termination, IXYS must pay Littelfuse a termination fee of
$28.5 million.

Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Merger 

        (see page 110)

        IXYS must pay Littelfuse a termination fee of $28.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances involving a company takeover proposal,
an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach of IXYS' non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement.

        All other expenses relating to the merger will generally be paid by the party incurring the expense.

Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Littelfuse and IXYS 

        (see page 128)

        IXYS stockholders receiving shares of Littelfuse common stock in the initial merger will have different rights once they become stockholders of Littelfuse due to
differences between the governing corporate documents applicable to IXYS and Littelfuse.

Risk Factors 

        (see page 32)

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION 

        The following tables summarize unaudited per share data for (i) Littelfuse on a historical basis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2017; (ii) Littelfuse on a pro forma condensed combined basis, assuming that the merger occurred on the dates indicated; (iii) IXYS on a historical basis for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and the six months ended September 30, 2017; and (iv) IXYS on a pro forma equivalent basis, which was calculated by multiplying the
corresponding pro forma condensed combined data by the exchange ratio of 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock to 1.0 share of IXYS common stock. It has been
assumed for purposes of the pro forma condensed combined financial information provided below that the pro forma events occurred on January 3, 2016 for earnings per share
purposes and on September 30, 2017 for book value per share purposes.

        The historical earnings per share information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Littelfuse and IXYS
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 151. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined earnings per share information is derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the section titled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information" and related notes included in this proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page 115. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position of Littelfuse following the merger.

(1) The pro forma equivalent share amounts were calculated by multiplying the pro forma condensed combined per share amounts by the exchange
ratio of 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock per share of IXYS common stock. This information shows how each share of IXYS
common stock would have participated in the combined company's net income and book value if the pro forma events had occurred on the
relevant dates. 

(2) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Littelfuse paid a cash dividend of $1.24 and
$0.99 per share, respectively, to its stockholders. The pro forma dividends per share are based solely on Littelfuse's historical dividends. 

(3) Amount is calculated by dividing stockholders' equity by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.

IXYS Common Stock 

        As of December 6, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, there were 22,713,798 shares of Littelfuse common stock outstanding and 70 holders of record of Littelfuse
common stock, and 32,935,335 shares of IXYS common stock outstanding and 216 holders of record of IXYS common stock.

        Because the number of shares of Littelfuse common stock issuable for each share of IXYS Common Stock in the merger will not be adjusted for changes in the market price
of either Littelfuse common stock or IXYS common stock, the market value of the shares of Littelfuse common stock that holders of IXYS common stock will have the right to
receive on the date the merger is completed may vary significantly from the market value of the shares of Littelfuse common stock that holders of IXYS common stock would
receive if the merger were completed on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        As a result, you should obtain recent market prices of Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock prior to voting your shares. See the section titled "Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Merger" beginning on page 32.

Dividends 

        Littelfuse currently pays regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. Littelfuse most recently paid a cash dividend on September 7, 2017, of $0.37 per share.
Littelfuse currently expects to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by Littelfuse's board of directors. The
payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including Littelfuse's financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

        IXYS pays quarterly cash dividends on its common stock at the discretion of its board of directors. IXYS most recently paid a cash dividend on July 5, 2016 of $0.04 per
share. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on IXYS' financial performance.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period before the closing of the merger, Littelfuse is not permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions on its
capital stock other than quarterly cash dividends not exceeding $0.37 per share, and IXYS is not permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock, in
each case without the consent of the other party.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus contain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are not limited to historical facts but reflect Littelfuse's and IXYS' current beliefs,
expectations or intentions regarding future events. Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "guidance," "intend," "may,"
"plan," "possible," "potential," "predict," "project," "pursue," "will," "should," "target," and other similar words, phrases or expressions are intended to identify such forward-
looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, Littelfuse's and IXYS' expectations with respect to the synergies, costs and other anticipated
financial impacts of the merger; future financial and operating results of the combined company; the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with
respect to future operations and services; required adoption of the merger agreement by IXYS stockholders; required approvals of the merger by governmental regulatory
authorities; the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the merger; and the timing of the completion of the merger.

        All forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-
looking statements, many of which are generally outside the control of Littelfuse and IXYS and difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, those set
forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32, as well as risks and uncertainties relating to:

• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or the failure to satisfy the closing
conditions; 

• the risk that the financing required to complete the merger is not obtained or is obtained on terms other than those currently anticipated; 

• the possibility that the consummation of the merger is delayed or does not occur, including due to the failure of IXYS stockholders to approve the merger
proposal; 

• the ability to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger, and the timing and conditions for such approvals, including conditions that could
reduce the expected synergies and other benefits of the merger, result in a material delay or the abandonment of the merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on
Littelfuse; 

• the taking of governmental action (including the passage of legislation) to block the merger or otherwise adversely affecting Littelfuse and IXYS; 

• the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against Littelfuse, IXYS or others following announcement of the merger; 

• the possibility that the expected synergies from the merger will not be realized or will take longer to realize than expected; 

• the ability of Littelfuse to successfully integrate the business of IXYS; 

• unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from the merger, whether or not consummated; 

• the uncertainty of the value of the stock consideration that IXYS stockholders will receive in the initial merger due to a fixed exchange ratio and a potential
fluctuation in the market price of Littelfuse common stock; 

• IXYS' directors and executive officers having interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of IXYS stockholders more generally;

• the possibility of changes in circumstances between the date of the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger that are not reflected in the
fairness opinion obtained by the IXYS board of directors; 

• the effect of restrictions placed on Littelfuse's, IXYS' or their respective subsidiaries' business activities and the limitations put on IXYS' ability to pursue
alternatives to the merger pursuant to the merger agreement; 

• the disruption from the merger making it more difficult for Littelfuse and IXYS to maintain relationships with their respective customers, employees or suppliers; 

• the response of activist stockholders to the merger; 

• the inability of Littelfuse and IXYS to retain key personnel; 

• the effect of the additional indebtedness that Littelfuse will incur in connection with the merger; 

• the possibility of actual results of operations, cash flows and financial position after the merger materially differing from the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus; and 

• the impact of global economic conditions, fluctuations in exchange rates, labor relations, competitive actions taken by other semiconductor businesses or other
competitors, terrorist attacks or natural disasters.

        Littelfuse and IXYS caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in Littelfuse's and
IXYS' most recently filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other SEC filings, as such
filings may be amended from time to time. All of the forward-looking statements made by Littelfuse or IXYS contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Littelfuse, IXYS, the merger or other matters attributable to Littelfuse or IXYS
or any person acting on either of their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above.

        Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, which speak only as of the date such
statements were made. Neither Littelfuse nor IXYS undertakes any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that
may arise after the date hereof, even if experience or future changes make it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as
may be required by applicable law. Neither Littelfuse nor IXYS intends to make any update or other revision to forward-looking statements, except as may be required by
applicable law.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed in the section titled
"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 30, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding whether to vote
for the merger proposal and the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, you should read and consider the risk factors associated with each of
the businesses of Littelfuse and IXYS because these risk factors will relate to the combined company following the completion of the merger. These risk factors may be found in
Littelfuse's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and IXYS' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and, in
each case, any amendments thereto, as such risk factors may be updated or supplemented in each company's subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current
Reports on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in this proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information"
beginning on page 151.

Risks Relating to the Merger 

Because the share-election exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for stock price changes and the market price of Littelfuse common stock has fluctuated and will
continue to fluctuate, IXYS stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive.

        Upon completion of the initial merger, each issued and outstanding share of IXYS common stock (other than (i) cancelled shares or (ii) dissenting shares) will be converted
into the right to receive, at the election of the stockholder and subject to proration, $23.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes or 0.1265 of a share of
Littelfuse common stock.

        The share-election ratio was derived using the volume weighted average price per share of Littelfuse common stock for a pre-determined trading period prior to the signing
of the merger agreement and will not change to reflect changes in the market price of IXYS and Littelfuse common stock. The market price of Littelfuse common stock at the
time of completion of the merger may vary significantly from the market price of Littelfuse common stock on the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus and the date of the IXYS special meeting. In addition, as discussed below, the merger consideration will be subject to proration. Accordingly, IXYS
stockholders will not know or be able to calculate at the time of the IXYS special meeting the market value of the stock consideration they will receive upon completion of the
merger.

        In addition, the merger might not be completed until a significant period of time has passed after the IXYS special meeting. Because the share-election exchange ratio will
not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market values of Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock, the market value of the Littelfuse common stock issued in
connection with the merger and the IXYS common stock surrendered in connection with the merger may be higher or lower than the value of those shares on earlier dates. Stock
price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in Littelfuse's and IXYS' respective businesses,
operations and prospects, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, the timing of the merger, regulatory considerations and other risk factors set
forth or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. Many of these factors are beyond Littelfuse's and IXYS' control.

IXYS common stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form elected.

        IXYS common stockholders electing to receive either the all-cash consideration or the all-stock consideration in the merger will be subject to proration so that 50% of IXYS
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into cash consideration and the

Table of Contents

remaining IXYS common stock will be converted into stock consideration. Accordingly, some of the merger consideration an IXYS common stockholder receives may differ
from the type of consideration selected and such difference may be significant. This may result in, among other things, tax consequences that differ from those that would have
resulted if the IXYS common stockholder had received solely the form of consideration elected. A discussion of the proration mechanism can be found under the section titled
"The Merger—Merger Consideration" and a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger can be found under the section titled "Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences."

The market price of Littelfuse common stock after the initial merger will continue to fluctuate and may be affected by factors different from those affecting shares of IXYS
common stock currently.

        Upon completion of the initial merger, certain holders of IXYS common stock will become holders of Littelfuse common stock. The market price of Littelfuse common
stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the initial merger and holders of IXYS common stock could lose the value of their investment in Littelfuse common
stock. In addition, any significant price and volume fluctuations of the stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the Littelfuse common
stock, regardless of Littelfuse's actual operating performance. In addition, Littelfuse's business differs in important respects from that of IXYS, and accordingly, the results of
operations of the combined company and the market price of Littelfuse common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those
currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Littelfuse and IXYS. For a discussion of the businesses of Littelfuse and IXYS and of some important factors
to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under "Where You Can Find
More Information" beginning on page 151.

Sales of shares of Littelfuse common stock after the completion of the merger may cause the market price of Littelfuse common stock to fall.

        Based on the number of outstanding shares of IXYS common stock as of December 6, 2017, Littelfuse would issue approximately 2.1 million shares of Littelfuse common
stock in the initial merger. Many IXYS stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of Littelfuse common stock they will receive in the initial merger. Other IXYS
stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of Littelfuse common stock that they
receive in the initial merger. Such sales of Littelfuse common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for Littelfuse common stock and may take place
promptly following the initial merger.

Completion of the merger is subject to the conditions contained in the merger agreement and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed.

        The obligations of Littelfuse and IXYS to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the approval of the merger
proposal by IXYS stockholders. For a more complete summary of the required regulatory approvals and the conditions to the closing of the merger, see the sections titled "The
Merger—Regulatory Approvals" and "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger."

        Many of the conditions to the closing of the merger are not within Littelfuse's or IXYS' control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be
satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to February 28, 2018, which deadline may be extended to May 28, 2018 under certain circumstances, it is
possible that the merger agreement will be terminated. Although Littelfuse and IXYS have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to complete the
merger as soon as practicable, these and other conditions to the completion of the merger

may not be satisfied. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring.
Any delay in completing the merger could cause Littelfuse not to realize some or all of the benefits that Littelfuse expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed
within its expected timeframe. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed. See the
risk factor titled "—Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect the stock price and the future business and financial results of IXYS," below.

The merger was subject to the expiration of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from regulatory authorities in the United States
and Germany. Those clearances have been received, but the merger may still be reviewed under antitrust statutes of other governmental authorities.

        Littelfuse and IXYS received early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in the United States on October 2, 2017, and on October 6, 2017, they
received the requisite clearance under the antitrust/merger control laws of Germany. The merger may still be reviewed under antitrust statutes of other governmental authorities,
including U.S. state laws. In deciding whether to grant the required regulatory approval, consent or clearance, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the
merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the approvals, consents and clearances that are granted may impose requirements,
limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company's business. Under the merger agreement, Littelfuse and IXYS have agreed to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals, consents and clearances and therefore may be required to comply with conditions or limitations imposed by governmental
authorities. There can be no assurance that other regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions
will not have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the
completion of the merger. In addition, neither Littelfuse nor IXYS can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or
abandonment of the merger. See the sections titled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals" and "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on
pages 84 and 108, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized.

        IXYS and Littelfuse have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits
and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Littelfuse's ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Littelfuse and IXYS. It is possible that the pendency of the
merger and/or the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention of both IXYS and Littelfuse, the
disruption of either company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to
maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. As part of the integration process, Littelfuse
may also attempt to divest certain assets of the combined company, which may not be possible on favorable terms, or at all, or if successful, may change the profile of the
combined company. If Littelfuse experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer
to realize than expected. Littelfuse's management continues to refine its integration plan. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on (i) each of Littelfuse and
IXYS during this transition period and (ii) the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the merger. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger
could be less than anticipated.

IXYS' directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder of IXYS more generally.

        When considering the recommendation of the IXYS board of directors that IXYS stockholders approve the merger proposal and the merger-related compensation proposal,
IXYS stockholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of IXYS have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
IXYS stockholders more generally. These interests generally include, among others, rights to accelerated vesting of stock options and certain payments and benefits in connection
with the merger and/or a qualifying termination of employment following the merger. See the section titled "The Merger—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger" beginning on page 75 for a more detailed description of these interests. The IXYS board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the
merits of the merger and considered them in deciding to recommend that IXYS stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal and the merger-related compensation proposal.

The merger agreement limits IXYS' ability to pursue alternatives to the merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire IXYS.

        The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for IXYS to sell its business to a party other than Littelfuse. These provisions include a general
prohibition on IXYS soliciting any company takeover proposal or offer for a competing transaction. Further, there are only limited exceptions to (i) IXYS' agreement that the
IXYS board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Littelfuse the recommendation of the IXYS board of directors that IXYS stockholders vote in favor
of the merger proposal and (ii) IXYS' agreement not to enter into an agreement with respect to a competing company takeover proposal. In addition, upon termination of the
merger agreement, IXYS is required to pay Littelfuse a termination fee of $28.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances involving a company
takeover proposal, an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach of IXYS' non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement.

        These provisions could discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of IXYS from considering or proposing that acquisition, even
if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the value proposed to be received or realized in the merger. These provisions might also result
in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may
become payable in certain circumstances.

The merger agreement subjects IXYS to restrictions on its business activities.

        The merger agreement subjects IXYS to restrictions on its business activities and obligates IXYS to generally operate its businesses in all material respects in the ordinary
course. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on IXYS' results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

The business relationships of Littelfuse and IXYS and their respective subsidiaries may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger, which could
have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Littelfuse, IXYS and, following the completion of the merger, the combined company.

        Parties with which Littelfuse and IXYS, or their respective subsidiaries, do business may be uncertain as to the effects on them of the merger and related transactions,
including with respect to current or future business relationships with Littelfuse, IXYS, their respective subsidiaries or the combined company. These relationships may be
subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Littelfuse and IXYS have a business relationship may delay or defer certain

business decisions or might decide to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Littelfuse or IXYS, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships
with parties other than Littelfuse, IXYS, their respective subsidiaries or the combined company. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash
flows and financial position of IXYS, Littelfuse or the combined company following the completion of the merger, including an adverse effect on Littelfuse's ability to realize the
expected synergies and other benefits of the merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of
the merger agreement.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect the stock price and the future business and financial results of IXYS.

        If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of IXYS stockholders failing to approve the merger proposal, the ongoing business of IXYS may be
adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, IXYS could be subject to a number of negative consequences, including the
following:

• IXYS may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price; 

• IXYS may experience negative reactions from its customers and suppliers; 

• IXYS may experience negative reactions from its employees and may not be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees; 

• IXYS will have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant non-recurring costs in connection with the merger that it may be unable to recover; 

• the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of IXYS' business prior to completion of the merger, the waiver of which is subject to the consent
of Littelfuse (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in certain circumstances), which may prevent IXYS from making certain acquisitions,
taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that may be beneficial to IXYS (see the
section titled "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Businesses of IXYS and Littelfuse Prior to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 98 for a description
of the restrictive covenants applicable to IXYS); and 

• matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by IXYS management, which could
otherwise be devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may be beneficial to IXYS as an independent company.

        In addition, upon termination of the merger agreement, IXYS is required to pay Littelfuse a termination fee of $28.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances involving a company takeover proposal, an adverse recommendation change or a willful breach of IXYS' non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement.
Finally, IXYS could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against IXYS to perform its
obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, any of these risks may materialize and may adversely affect IXYS' businesses, financial condition,
financial results and stock price.

The shares of Littelfuse common stock to be received by IXYS stockholders as a result of the merger will have rights different from the shares of IXYS common stock.

        Upon completion of the initial merger, IXYS stockholders will no longer be stockholders of IXYS. Former IXYS stockholders who receive stock consideration in the initial
merger will become Littelfuse stockholders, and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the terms of the Littelfuse certificate of incorporation and bylaws and by the
DGCL. See the section titled "Comparison of Rights of Common Stockholders of Littelfuse and IXYS" beginning on page 128 for a discussion of the different rights associated
with Littelfuse common stock.

After the initial merger, IXYS stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Littelfuse than they currently have in IXYS and will exercise less
influence over management.

        Based on the number of shares of IXYS common stock outstanding as of December 6, 2017, and the number of shares of Littelfuse common stock outstanding as of
December 6, 2017, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the initial merger, former IXYS stockholders will own approximately 8% of the outstanding shares of
Littelfuse common stock. Consequently, former IXYS stockholders will have less influence over the management and policies of Littelfuse than they currently have over the
management and policies of IXYS.

In connection with the merger, Littelfuse will incur new indebtedness, which could adversely affect Littelfuse, including by decreasing Littelfuse's business flexibility, and
will increase its interest expense.

        Littelfuse's consolidated indebtedness as of July 1, 2017 was approximately $482 million. Littelfuse's pro forma indebtedness as of July 1, 2017, after giving effect to the
merger and the anticipated incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, will be as much as $630 million. Littelfuse will have substantially increased indebtedness
following completion of the merger in comparison to Littelfuse's indebtedness on a recent historical basis. In particular, in order to consummate the merger, Littelfuse expects to
incur up to $150 million of new debt.

        This indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Littelfuse's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing
Littelfuse's interest expense. The amount of cash required to pay interest on Littelfuse's increased indebtedness levels following completion of the merger, and thus the demands
on Littelfuse's cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service the indebtedness of Littelfuse prior to the transaction. The cash resources required
to service the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the merger could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and
other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for Littelfuse relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If Littelfuse does not achieve the
expected benefits and cost savings from the merger, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then Littelfuse's ability to
service its indebtedness may be adversely impacted.

        Certain of the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger may bear interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create
higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect Littelfuse's cash flows.

        Moreover, Littelfuse may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate
requirements. Littelfuse's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Littelfuse's financial position and performance, as well as
prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Littelfuse's control. Littelfuse cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms
acceptable to Littelfuse or at all.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary and the actual financial condition and
results of operations after the merger may differ materially from them.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of what Littelfuse's actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon assumptions, preliminary estimates and accounting reclassifications,
to record the IXYS identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this proxy
statement/prospectus is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of IXYS
as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this
proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the section titled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" beginning on page 115.

The merger will involve substantial costs.

        IXYS and Littelfuse have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two
companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction costs related to the merger.

        Littelfuse also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and
employment-related costs. Littelfuse continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the
two companies' businesses. Although Littelfuse expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the
businesses, should allow Littelfuse to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. See the risk factor titled "—
Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized"
above.

Lawsuits may in the future be filed against IXYS, its directors, Littelfuse and Merger Sub challenging the merger, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the
merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.

        Transactions like the merger are frequently the subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that the board of directors of either IXYS or
Littelfuse breached their respective fiduciary duties to their stockholders by entering into the merger agreement, by failing to obtain a greater value in the transaction for their
stockholders or otherwise. Both IXYS and Littelfuse believe that any such litigation or proceedings would be without merit, but there can be no assurance that they will not be
brought. If litigation or other legal proceedings are in fact brought against either IXYS or Littelfuse or against the board of directors of either company, they will defend against
it, but they might not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse
effect on the business, results of operation or financial position of IXYS, Littelfuse or the combined company, including through the possible diversion of either company's
resources or distraction of key personnel.

        Further, one of the conditions to the completion of the merger is that no injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that temporarily
or permanently prohibits, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the merger. As such, if any of the plaintiffs are successful

in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the merger, that injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the
expected timeframe.

Uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of IXYS or Littelfuse, which could adversely affect the future
business and operations of the combined company following the merger.

        IXYS and Littelfuse are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined
company's success after the merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of IXYS and Littelfuse. Current and
prospective employees of IXYS and Littelfuse may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially
adversely affect the ability of each of IXYS and Littelfuse to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the
combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of IXYS and Littelfuse.

Other Risk Factors of Littelfuse and IXYS 

        Littelfuse's and IXYS' businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, Littelfuse and IXYS are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks
described in Littelfuse's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and IXYS' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, as
updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. The risks described above and in those filings represent all known material risks with respect to Littelfuse's and IXYS' businesses. See the section titled

INFORMATION ABOUT THE IXYS SPECIAL MEETING 

General 

        This proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to IXYS stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of IXYS for use at the special meeting

considered at the special meeting.

        A list of IXYS stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at the special meeting and for ten days prior to the special meeting between the hours of
9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., local time, at IXYS' corporate headquarters at 1590 Buckeye Drive, Milpitas, California 95035.

Shares and Voting of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of December 6, 2017, the record date, IXYS directors and executive officers, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote 6,917,562 shares of IXYS common stock, or
approximately 21.0% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock. IXYS currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the
merger proposal and each of the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus, although none of them, other than Dr. Nathan Zommer, has entered into any
agreement obligating them to do so.

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of Dr. Nathan Zommer (the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IXYS) and certain of his
controlled affiliates entered into the voting agreement with Littelfuse pursuant to which each party agreed, among other things, to vote the shares of IXYS common stock held by
such party in favor of the merger proposal. See the section titled "The Voting Agreement" beginning on page 113.

        As of December 6, 2017, the record date, approximately 20.5% of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock were subject to the voting agreement, a copy of which is
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B.

Quorum and Broker Non-Votes 

        In order for IXYS to transact business at the special meeting, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock entitled to vote at the meeting must
be present in person or represented by proxy. Stockholders choosing to abstain from voting will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present,
but will not be counted as votes cast "FOR" any matter.

        Banks, brokerage firms and other nominees who hold shares for the accounts of their clients may vote such shares either as directed by their clients or in their own discretion
on "routine" matters. When a broker does not receive instructions from a non-record owner on how to vote shares with respect to a "non-routine" matter, a broker "non-vote"
occurs. Broker "non-votes" will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be counted as votes cast "FOR" any matter.

Required Vote 

        The votes required for each proposal are as follows:

        The Merger Proposal.    The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock entitled to vote on the merger
proposal is required to approve the merger proposal. If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and take any action other than voting (or causing your shares to be voted)
"FOR" the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. For example, if you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        The Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation proposal. If
you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and attend the IXYS special meeting in person but fail to vote, or you are a stockholder and mark your proxy or voting
instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger-related compensation proposal. If you are an IXYS stockholder and fail to vote by not
attending the IXYS special meeting, in person or by proxy, or you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the merger-related
compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

        The Adjournment Proposal.    The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the adjournment proposal is required to approve the adjournment proposal. If you are an IXYS stockholder on the record date and attend the IXYS special meeting in
person but fail to vote, or you are a stockholder and mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adjournment
proposal. If you are an IXYS stockholder and fail to vote by not attending the IXYS special meeting, in person or by proxy, or you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee to vote, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

How To Vote or Have Your Shares Voted 

        IXYS stockholders of record may vote their shares of IXYS common stock or submit a proxy to have their shares of IXYS common stock voted at the special meeting in
one of the following ways:

• Internet:  IXYS stockholders may submit their proxy by using the Internet at www.investorvote.com/IXYS. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be
accessible until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on January 11, 2018, the day before the special meeting. 

• Telephone:  IXYS stockholders may submit their proxy by using a touch-tone telephone at 1-800-652-VOTE (8683). Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day
and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on January 11, 2018, the day before the special meeting. 

• Mail:  IXYS stockholders may submit their proxy by properly completing, signing, dating and mailing their proxy card in the postage-paid envelope (if mailed in
the United States) included with this proxy statement/prospectus. IXYS stockholders who vote this way should mail the proxy card early enough so that it is
received before the date of the special meeting. 

• In Person:  IXYS stockholders may vote in person at the special meeting or by sending a representative with an acceptable proxy that has been signed and dated.
Attendance at the special meeting will not, however, in and of itself constitute a vote.

        Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, IXYS urges you to submit your proxy by completing and returning the proxy card as promptly as possible, or by
submitting your proxy by telephone or via the Internet, prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of IXYS common stock will be represented and voted at the special
meeting if you are unable to attend.

        The IXYS board of directors has appointed certain persons as proxy holders to vote proxies in accordance with the instructions of IXYS stockholders. If you are a
stockholder of record and you authorize these proxy holders to vote your shares of IXYS common stock with respect to any matter to be acted upon, your shares will be voted in
accordance with your instructions in your proxy. If you are a stockholder of record and you authorize these proxy holders to vote your shares but do not specify how your shares
should be voted in one or more matters, these proxy holders will vote your shares on those matters as the IXYS board of directors recommends, except if you indicate that you
wish to vote against the merger proposal, in which case your shares of IXYS common stock will only be voted in favor of the merger-related compensation proposal and the
adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of such proposals. If any other matter properly comes before the special meeting, these proxy holders will
vote on that matter in their discretion.

        If you are a non-record owner, you must direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote the shares of IXYS common stock held in your account and you
will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee describing how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock. The availability of Internet or telephonic
voting will depend on the nominee's voting process. Please check with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and follow the voting procedures your bank, brokerage firm
or other nominee provides.

        If you are a non-record owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock with respect
to "non-routine" matters, a broker "non-vote" occurs with respect to those matters. Under applicable stock exchange rules, the organization that holds your shares of IXYS
common stock (i.e., your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee) may generally vote on routine matters at its discretion but cannot vote your shares on "non-routine" matters
without your instructions. If you are a non-record owner and the organization that holds your shares of IXYS common stock does not receive instructions from you on how to
vote your shares of IXYS common stock on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares of IXYS common stock will inform the inspector of elections that it
does not have the authority to vote

your shares on such matters. The merger proposal, the merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal will be considered "non-routine." Accordingly, if you
are a non-record owner and do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of IXYS common stock, your bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee generally will not be permitted to vote your shares on any of the proposals. If you are a non-record holder, IXYS strongly encourages you to provide voting
instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee so that your vote will be counted on all matters.

        If you are a non-record owner, you are invited to attend the special meeting; however, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you obtain a
legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies 

        IXYS stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the voting at the special meeting in any of the following ways:

• submitting another properly completed proxy card with a later date; 

• sending timely written notice that you are revoking your proxy to IXYS Corporation's Secretary, Uzi Sasson, at 1590 Buckeye Drive, Milpitas, California 95035; 

• submitting a proxy via Internet or by telephone at a later date (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not, however, in and of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior
proxy.

        IXYS non-record owners may change their voting instruction only by following the directions received from their bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for changing their
voting instructions.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        IXYS will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the special meeting. In addition to sending and making available these materials, some of IXYS' directors, officers
and employees may solicit proxies in person by contacting IXYS stockholders by telephone or over the Internet. IXYS stockholders may also be solicited by press releases issued
by IXYS, postings on IXYS' websites and advertisements in periodicals. None of IXYS' directors, officers or employees will receive additional compensation for their
solicitation services. IXYS has engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. IXYS estimates that it will pay D.F. King a fee of approximately
$10,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Certain banking institutions, brokerage firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries who hold shares for the benefit of
another party may solicit proxies for IXYS. If so, they will mail proxy information to, or otherwise communicate with, the non-record owners of shares of IXYS common stock
held by them. IXYS will also reimburse banks, brokerage firms, custodians, trustees, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and proxy materials
to non-record owners of IXYS common stock.

Adjournments 

        The special meeting may be adjourned in the absence of a quorum by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the adjournment.

Table of Contents

        Even if a quorum is present, the special meeting may also be adjourned in order to provide more time to solicit additional proxies in favor of approval of the merger proposal
if sufficient votes are cast in favor of the adjournment proposal.

        If the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Questions and Additional Information 

        You may contact IXYS' proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., 48 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, with any questions about the special meeting, the merger, the
proposals or this proxy statement/prospectus, if you would like additional copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, if you need to obtain proxy cards or other information related
to the proxy solicitation or if you need help submitting a proxy or voting your shares of IXYS common stock. Stockholders may call toll-free at (800) 334-0384, and banks and

PROPOSAL 1: THE MERGER PROPOSAL 

        As discussed throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, IXYS is asking its stockholders to approve the merger proposal. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Littelfuse will
acquire IXYS in the merger. Merger Sub will merge with and into IXYS, with IXYS continuing as the surviving corporation in the initial merger and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Littelfuse. Further to the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS, as the surviving corporation of the initial merger, will merge with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub
Two continuing as the surviving company in the follow-on merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. If the merger is completed, IXYS will cease to be publicly traded
and IXYS common stock will be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

        As described in further detail in the sections titled "Questions and Answers" beginning on page 1, "Summary" beginning on page 12, "The Merger" beginning on page 50
and "The Merger Agreement" beginning on page 88, the IXYS board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger. For a discussion of certain
factors considered by the IXYS board of directors in determining to approve the merger agreement and recommend that IXYS stockholders vote for the merger proposal, see the
section titled "The Merger—IXYS' Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of IXYS Board of Directors" beginning on page 56. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

        The merger is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including approval of the merger proposal by the stockholders of IXYS at the
special meeting. Accordingly, the approval of the merger proposal by IXYS stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Littelfuse and IXYS to complete the merger.

        The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IXYS common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal is required
to approve the merger proposal.

        THE IXYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT IXYS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

PROPOSAL 2: THE MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 

        IXYS is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a vote, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, to approve the compensation payments that may be paid or
become payable by IXYS to its named executive officers, as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, in connection with the merger as disclosed in the
section titled "Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to IXYS' Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger," including the table titled "Golden
Parachute Compensation" and the accompanying footnotes, under "The Merger—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 75
(referred to in this section of the proxy statement/prospectus as the "golden parachute" compensation), as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act.

        Through this proposal, IXYS is asking its stockholders to indicate their approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation that IXYS' named executive
officers will or may be eligible to receive in connection with the merger as described in the section "Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to IXYS' Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger" referred to above.

        You should carefully review the "golden parachute" compensation information disclosed in the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus referred to above. The IXYS
board of directors unanimously recommends that IXYS stockholders approve the following resolution:

        RESOLVED, that the stockholders of IXYS approve, solely on an advisory, non-binding basis, the "golden parachute" compensation that will or may be paid or become
payable to IXYS' named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section titled "Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to IXYS' Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger," including the table titled "Golden Parachute Compensation" and the accompanying
footnotes, under "The Merger—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 75.

        The vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger
proposal and vote not to approve the merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will
not be binding on either IXYS or Littelfuse. Accordingly, if the merger proposal is approved and the merger is completed, the compensation payments that are contractually
required to be paid by IXYS to its named executive officers will or may be paid or become payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of
the non-binding, advisory vote of IXYS stockholders on the merger-related compensation proposal.

        The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the merger-related
compensation proposal at the special meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-related compensation proposal.

        THE IXYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT IXYS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE MERGER-RELATED
COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

PROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL 

        IXYS stockholders are being asked to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve
the merger proposal at the time of the special meeting.

        If this proposal is approved, under the merger agreement the special meeting may be adjourned (i) to any date that is within 20 business days of the date on which the IXYS
special meeting was originally scheduled (or any later date to which such date may be extended pursuant to the provisions in the merger agreement described under "The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 109) or (ii) with the prior written consent of Littelfuse, to any other date.

        If the special meeting is so adjourned, IXYS stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and
return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the merger proposal but do not indicate a choice on
the adjournment proposal, your shares of IXYS common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. If you indicate, however, that you wish to vote against the
merger proposal, your shares of IXYS common stock will only be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

        The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of IXYS common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the adjournment
proposal at the special meeting is required to approve the adjournment proposal.

        THE IXYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT IXYS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

THE MERGER 

        This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the material aspects of the proposed merger. This section may not contain all of the information that is important to
you. You should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including the full text of
the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the proposed merger. In addition,
important business and financial information about each of Littelfuse and IXYS is included in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section
titled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 151.

Merger Consideration 

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into IXYS, with IXYS surviving the
initial merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. Further to the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS, as the surviving corporation of the initial merger, will merge with
and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two continuing as the surviving company in the follow-on merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. Upon completion of
the merger, each issued and outstanding share of IXYS common stock (other than (i) cancelled shares or (ii) dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder of such share and subject to proration, $23.00 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, or 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common
stock. No fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock will be issued in the merger, and holders of IXYS common stock will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Littelfuse common stock.

        The merger consideration is subject to proration so that 50% of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the initial merger will
be converted into cash consideration and the remaining IXYS common stock will be converted into stock consideration, based on an exchange ratio of 0.1265 of a share of
Littelfuse common stock (which exchange ratio was derived by dividing the cash consideration of $23.00 by the volume weighted average price per share of Littelfuse common
stock for a pre-determined trading period prior to the signing of the merger agreement). Holders of IXYS common stock who do not make an election will be treated as having
elected to receive cash consideration or stock consideration in accordance with the proration methodology in the merger agreement.

        Based on the number of shares of IXYS common stock outstanding as of December 6, 2017, Littelfuse would issue approximately 2.1 million shares of Littelfuse common
stock to IXYS stockholders pursuant to the merger. The actual number of shares of Littelfuse common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger will be determined at completion
of the merger based on the exchange ratio and the number of shares of IXYS common stock outstanding at such time. Based on the number of shares of IXYS common stock
outstanding as of December 6, 2017, and the number of shares of Littelfuse common stock outstanding as of December 6, 2017, immediately after completion of the merger,
former IXYS stockholders would own approximately 8% of the outstanding shares of Littelfuse common stock.

        Based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on December 11, 2017, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the
per share value of IXYS common stock implied by the stock consideration is $24.90. The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate, however, as the market price of
Littelfuse common stock fluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed number of shares of Littelfuse common stock. As a result, the value of the stock
consideration that IXYS stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the date
of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the IXYS special meeting. Accordingly, IXYS and

Littelfuse encourage you to obtain current stock price quotations for Littelfuse common stock and IXYS common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to approval of
the merger proposal.

Background of the Merger 

        IXYS management and the IXYS board of directors have periodically evaluated IXYS' competitive position and various strategic alternatives to enhance value for IXYS
stockholders, including opportunities for acquisitions as well as a sale of IXYS either initiated by IXYS or in response to inquiries received from third parties expressing interest
in a potential strategic combination, including from Littelfuse and Company A, a United States based publicly traded semiconductor company. The inquiries received from third
parties prior to February, 2017 were of a preliminary nature and did not lead to a bona fide proposal with a purchase price or that was otherwise sufficiently compelling for the
IXYS board of directors.

        On February 21, 2017, Eyal Altman, Vice President and General Manager—Automotive Electronics Business at Littelfuse, contacted Uzi Sasson, President and Chief
Executive Officer of IXYS, by email to express interest in exploring a strategic combination between Littelfuse and IXYS. On March 11, 2017, Mr. Altman contacted Mr. Sasson
by telephone to propose a meeting on March 20, 2017.

        On March 14, 2017, Littelfuse delivered a draft confidentiality agreement to IXYS. Following further communications, the parties entered into a confidentiality agreement
on March 17, 2017.

        On March 20, 2017, Mr. Altman, David Heinzmann, President and Chief Executive Officer of Littelfuse, and Gordon Hunter, Executive Chairman of the Littelfuse board of
directors, met with Mr. Sasson and Dr. Zommer to discuss the respective businesses of Littelfuse and IXYS and a potential combination between Littelfuse and IXYS. Following
further communications, the parties amended and restated the confidentiality agreement on April 10, 2017 to include a standstill provision.

        On May 5, 2017, Dave Coughlan, Vice President of Business Development at Littelfuse, contacted Mr. Sasson by telephone to inform him that Littelfuse was considering a
proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of IXYS for a price of $21.35 per share. Mr. Sasson informed Mr. Coughlan that IXYS was willing to consider a proposal from
Littelfuse. The closing trading price of IXYS common stock on May 5, 2017 was $13.90.

        On May 12, 2017, Mr. Coughlan contacted Mr. Sasson by telephone to inform him that Littelfuse was considering a revised proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of
IXYS for a price of $21.75 per share. Mr. Sasson reiterated that IXYS was willing to consider a proposal from Littelfuse. The closing trading price of IXYS common stock on
May 12, 2017 was $14.85.

        On May 15, 2017, Mr. Sasson contacted Mr. Coughlan by telephone to discuss the potential proposal shared by Littelfuse on May 12, 2017. Mr. Coughlan reiterated
Littelfuse's interest in acquiring IXYS on the terms communicated on May 12, 2017.

        On May 31, 2017, Dr. Zommer met Mr. Heinzmann and Ian Highley, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Semiconductor Business and Chief Technology
Officer at Littelfuse, in Germany, where they discussed the respective businesses and operations of IXYS and Littelfuse. The next day Messrs. Heinzmann and Highley toured

IXYS board of directors, representatives of Needham & Company joined the meeting to review and discuss with the IXYS board of directors potential strategic alternatives
available to IXYS and Needham & Company's perspectives regarding consolidation in IXYS' industry and third parties that may have an interest in a transaction with IXYS. The
IXYS board of directors authorized management to engage Needham & Company to assist the IXYS board of directors in any evaluation of a proposal from Littelfuse from a
financial point of view and exploration of available strategic alternatives on the basis of Needham & Company's familiarity with IXYS, expertise in mergers and acquisitions and
experience in the semiconductor industry.

        On June 16, 2017, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Company A met with Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson at the IXYS office in Milpitas, California
and indicated that Company A was considering a proposal for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of IXYS. Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson informed Company A that
IXYS was willing to consider a proposal from Company A.

        On June 23, 2017, IXYS entered into an engagement letter with Needham & Company for the provision of financial advisory services in connection with a potential sale of
IXYS.

        On June 23, 2017, Mr. Jones contacted Ryan Stafford, Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Human Resources Officer and Corporate Secretary of Littelfuse, by
telephone to discuss a proposed meeting of the IXYS board of directors and members of Littelfuse senior management on June 27, 2017 and June 28, 2017 to further discuss the
potential proposal outlined by Littelfuse on May 5, 2017.

        On June 27, 2017, Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson met in person with Messrs. Heinzmann and Hunter to discuss IXYS and its business as well as Littelfuse and its business and

        On June 28, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met at a hotel in Milpitas, California, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Littelfuse, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (referred
to in this proxy statement/prospectus as Morgan Stanley), financial advisor to Littelfuse, and Needham & Company also in attendance. Messrs. Heinzmann, Hunter and Coughlan
delivered a presentation on Littelfuse and its business and how the IXYS business may fit within a combined organization. Mr. Heinzmann presented a non-binding proposal for
an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of IXYS for a price of $22.35 per share, including a mix of stock and cash consideration. The Littelfuse proposal was subject to
satisfactory completion of due diligence and contingent on the parties entering into an exclusivity agreement. The proposal was not subject to a financing condition. The closing
trading price of IXYS common stock on June 28, 2017 was $16.80. Following the conclusion of the Littelfuse presentation and the departure of representatives of Littelfuse, the
IXYS board of directors discussed the Littelfuse proposal, the Company A indication of interest and other strategic alternatives with representatives of Needham & Company. At
the request of the IXYS board of directors, the Needham & Company representatives provided the IXYS board of directors with an update regarding market trends in the
semiconductor industry. The Needham & Company representatives then discussed with the IXYS board of directors and management potential parties to be contacted in
connection with a strategic transaction. The IXYS board of directors instructed IXYS management and Needham & Company to continue non-exclusive discussions with
Littelfuse and to conduct outreach to other potential acquirers, including to enter into confidentiality agreements with other potential acquirers.

        On June 28, 2017, Dr. Zommer and Messrs. Sasson and Jones met with representatives of Needham & Company at the IXYS office in Milpitas, California and authorized

IXYS and its business, Company A and its business and how the IXYS business may fit within a combined organization.

        On July 5, 2017, a representative of Company B, a United States based publicly traded semiconductor company, contacted Needham & Company to indicate that it was
considering a proposal for a strategic transaction with IXYS. Based on the instruction of the IXYS board of directors, representatives of Needham & Company delivered a draft
confidentiality agreement to Company B on July 5, 2017. Following further communications, IXYS and Company B entered into a confidentiality agreement on July 13, 2017,
which included a standstill provision.

        On July 7, 2017, Company A contacted Mr. Sasson by telephone to communicate that it was considering a proposal for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of
IXYS for a price in a preliminary range of $23.00-25.00 per share, subject to conducting due diligence, and indicated flexibility in using stock or cash consideration for the
acquisition.

        On July 7, 2017, Mr. Coughlan contacted Mr. Sasson by telephone to discuss the status of the potential transaction. Mr. Sasson communicated to Mr. Coughlan that a
purchase price of $22.35 per share was not likely to be supported by the IXYS board of directors and informed him that IXYS had been approached by another party which had
indicated a purchase price of around $25.00 per share.

        On July 7, 2017, based on the instruction of the IXYS board of directors, representatives of Needham & Company delivered a draft confidentiality agreement to Company
A. Following further communications, IXYS and Company A entered into a confidentiality agreement on July 19, 2017, which included a standstill provision.

        On July 19, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met telephonically, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Needham & Company and Latham & Watkins LLP, counsel to
IXYS, also in attendance. At the request of the IXYS board of directors, representatives of Needham & Company presented an update regarding discussions with potential
acquirers, including Company A's indication on July 7, 2017 that it was considering a proposal. A representative of Needham & Company presented preliminary financial
analyses with respect to IXYS and potential strategic combinations. The IXYS board of directors instructed representatives of Needham & Company to continue its outreach to
potential acquirers, including enabling access to due diligence materials, and to seek final written proposals from any interested acquirers, including Littelfuse and Company A,
by July 26, 2017. A representative from Latham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the IXYS board of directors their fiduciary duties to IXYS and its stockholders under
Delaware law in connection with a sale of IXYS.

        On July 20, 2017, based on the instruction of the IXYS board of directors, Needham & Company provided Littelfuse, Company A and Company B with access to a virtual
data room with respect to IXYS and its business.

        On July 24, 2017, representatives of each of Littelfuse and Company A separately met by telephone with IXYS management and representatives of Needham & Company
for due diligence discussions.

        On July 25, 2017, Littelfuse submitted to Needham & Company a written non-binding proposal for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of IXYS for a price of
$23.00 per share, including a mix of stock and cash consideration that provided for 45% of IXYS shares to be converted into the stock consideration. Littelfuse communicated to
Needham & Company that the proposal was contingent on the parties entering into an exclusivity agreement. The closing trading price of IXYS common stock on July 25, 2017
was $17.40.

        On July 26, 2017, a representative of Company B communicated to a representative of Needham & Company that Company B would not submit a proposal for the
acquisition of IXYS because management of Company B did not believe there was a good strategic fit with IXYS.

        On July 26, 2017, Company A submitted to Needham & Company a written non-binding proposal for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of IXYS for a price in
the range of $20.00-21.00 per share, including a mix of stock and cash consideration. The proposal was contingent on the parties entering into an exclusivity agreement. The
closing trading price of IXYS common stock on July 26, 2017 was $17.55. A representative of Needham & Company asked a representative of Company A whether Company A
would consider increasing its proposed purchase price, and the representative of Company A indicated that it was unlikely Company A would increase its proposed purchase
price.

        On July 26, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met telephonically, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Needham & Company and Latham & Watkins also in attendance. A
representative from Latham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the IXYS board of directors their fiduciary duties to IXYS and its stockholders under Delaware law in
connection with a sale of IXYS. Representatives of Needham & Company presented an update regarding discussions with potential acquirers, including the revised proposal
received from Littelfuse on July 25, 2017 and the initial proposal received from Company A on July 26, 2017, and updated preliminary financial analyses with respect to IXYS
and potential strategic combinations. The IXYS board of directors discussed the relative merits of each of the Littelfuse and Company A proposals and considered further
negotiation of the purchase price or entering into an exclusivity arrangement with either party. The IXYS board of directors evaluated various factors, including the higher
proposed purchase price from Littelfuse, communication by Littelfuse that its proposal submitted on July 25, 2017 was its final proposal, communication by Company A that it
was unlikely to improve its proposal submitted on July 26, 2017, the extended period of time during which IXYS and Needham & Company had engaged with each of Littelfuse
and Company A and their familiarity with each company, the uncertainty of potential interest from any other party based on the outreach to potential acquirers conducted by
Needham & Company and the possibility of Littelfuse withdrawing its proposal or otherwise indicating it was not prepared to proceed with a transaction if IXYS declined to
enter into an exclusivity agreement or requested a further increase in the purchase price. Following the discussion, the IXYS board of directors authorized IXYS management to
enter into a 21-day exclusivity agreement with Littelfuse and to commence negotiations with Littelfuse on the basis of a proposed purchase price of $23.00 per share, including a
mix of cash and stock consideration. Following the IXYS board meeting, representatives of Needham & Company contacted a representative of Company A and indicated that
IXYS was going to proceed with another company, and there was no further response from Company A. On July 29, 2017, IXYS entered into the exclusivity agreement with
Littelfuse.

        From June 28, 2017, when the IXYS board of directors authorized IXYS management and Needham & Company to conduct outreach to potential acquirers, through July 29,
2017, when IXYS entered into the exclusivity agreement with Littelfuse, IXYS management and representatives of Needham & Company reached out to or were contacted by 13
parties regarding their possible interest in an acquisition of IXYS. During this period, IXYS entered into confidentiality agreements with three parties, namely Littelfuse,
Company A and Company B, all of which contained standstill provisions which terminated in accordance with their terms upon IXYS' entry into the merger agreement.
Additionally, IXYS management had meetings with and received written proposals from two parties, Littelfuse and Company A.

        On August 4, 2017 and on August 9, 2017, representatives of Littelfuse and Morgan Stanley met with IXYS management and representatives of Needham & Company to
discuss the due diligence being performed by Littelfuse and IXYS.

        On August 8, 2017, Latham & Watkins received an initial draft of the merger agreement from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to Littelfuse. Throughout the period
that IXYS and Littelfuse were negotiating the merger agreement, Messrs. Sasson and Jones spoke on numerous occasions with Latham & Watkins and provided updates to the
IXYS board of directors on the status of negotiations.

Furthermore, Mr. Sasson communicated on several occasions with Mr. Coughlan to discuss the terms of the merger agreement.

        On August 14, 2017, Latham & Watkins sent its comments to the draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

        On August 16, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met telephonically, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Needham & Company and Latham & Watkins also in attendance.
Representatives of Latham & Watkins provided an update on the potential transaction with Littelfuse, including a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement
submitted by Littelfuse. Representatives of Needham & Company presented Needham & Company's preliminary financial analyses of the consideration that would be payable to
IXYS' stockholders pursuant to the proposed transaction with Littelfuse.

        On August 18, 2017, Latham & Watkins received a revised draft of the merger agreement from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Following the receipt of the draft on
August 18, 2017 and through August 25, 2017, Latham & Watkins and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement.

        On August 22, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met telephonically, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Latham & Watkins also in attendance. Messrs. Sasson and Jones
provided an update on the discussion of the definitive documentation with Littelfuse, including substantive issues which continued to be negotiated to achieve improved terms for
IXYS stockholders, including among others, the proportion of outstanding IXYS shares that would be converted into the stock consideration and the cash and stock election
mechanics.

        On August 23, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met telephonically, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Latham & Watkins also in attendance. Mr. Sasson provided an
update on the discussion of definitive documentation with Littelfuse, including substantive issues which continued to be negotiated to achieve improved terms for IXYS
stockholders, including among others, the termination fee payable by IXYS under certain circumstances and the timing for the closing of a transaction. At IXYS' request,
Littelfuse agreed to increase the proportion of outstanding IXYS shares that would be converted into the stock consideration from 45% to 50%.

        On August 25, 2017, the IXYS board of directors met telephonically, with Mr. Jones and representatives of Latham & Watkins and Needham & Company also in attendance.
Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the members of the IXYS board of directors their fiduciary duties to IXYS and its stockholders under Delaware law in
connection with a sale of IXYS. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then provided an update on the transaction with Littelfuse, including the terms of the final merger
agreement negotiated with Littelfuse. Representatives of Needham & Company presented Needham & Company's financial analyses of the consideration pursuant to the
proposed transaction with Littelfuse and delivered Needham & Company's oral opinion to the IXYS board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated August 25, 2017, that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written
opinion, the consideration of $23.00 in cash or 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock per share of IXYS common stock to be received by the holders of IXYS common
stock (other than the holders of cancelled shares and dissenting shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following
further discussion, and taking into account the factors described below in greater detail under the section entitled "The Merger—IXYS' Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation
of IXYS Board of Directors" beginning on page 56, the IXYS board of directors unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to, and
in the best interests of, IXYS and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, for IXYS to enter into the merger agreement. A representative of Latham & Watkins then reviewed
the anticipated timing for the execution of the merger agreement, the announcement of the transaction and initial filings with the SEC.

        Following the August 25, 2017 meeting of the IXYS board of directors, IXYS and Littelfuse executed the merger agreement and on August 28, 2017 announced the
transaction in a press release prior to the opening of US stock markets.

IXYS' Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of IXYS Board of Directors 

        At its August 25, 2017 meeting held to evaluate the proposed merger, the IXYS board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the
terms of the merger are fair to and in the best interests of IXYS stockholders. The IXYS board of directors recommends that IXYS stockholders vote:

        1.     "FOR" the merger proposal;

        2.     "FOR" the merger-related compensation proposal; and

        3.     "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        In evaluating the merger and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the IXYS board of directors consulted with IXYS' senior management, IXYS' financial
advisor, Needham & Company, and IXYS' outside legal counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP, and considered a number of substantive factors, both positive and negative, and
potential benefits and detriments of the merger to IXYS and its stockholders. The IXYS board of directors believed that, taken as a whole, the following factors supported its
decision to approve the proposed merger:

• Merger Consideration. The value of the merger consideration to be received by IXYS stockholders in relation to (1) the market prices of IXYS common stock
prior to the IXYS board of directors' approval of the merger agreement; and (2) the value that could potentially be obtained through other strategic alternatives
available to IXYS. 

• Premium to Trading Price of IXYS Common Stock. The fact that the cash consideration of $23.00 per share and the implied value of the stock consideration of
$22.55 per share, based on the $178.26 closing price per share of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017, the last full trading day before the announcement
of the merger, were both higher than the closing price per share of IXYS' common stock at any date in the past five years and represented a significant premium
over the market prices at which IXYS common stock had previously traded, including a premium on the value of the cash consideration of approximately: 

• 44% over the closing price per share of IXYS common stock on August 25, 2017; 

• 39% over the 30-day average closing price per share of IXYS common stock as of August 25, 2017; and 

• 40% over the 60-day average closing price per share of IXYS common stock as of August 25, 2017. 

• Uncertainty of Future Common Stock Market Price. The IXYS board of directors considered IXYS' business, assets, financial condition, results of operations,
management, competitive position and prospects, as well as current industry, economic and stock and credit market conditions. The IXYS board of directors also
considered IXYS' financial plan and the initiatives and the potential execution risks associated with such plan. In connection with these considerations, the IXYS
board of directors considered the attendant risk that if IXYS remained independent IXYS common stock may not trade at levels equal to or greater than the value
of the merger consideration in the near term, over an extended period of time or at all. 

• Negotiations with Littelfuse. The benefits that IXYS and its advisors were able to obtain during its negotiations with Littelfuse, including an increase in
Littelfuse's offer price per share from the beginning of the process to the end of the negotiations. The IXYS board of directors believed that the consideration
reflected in the merger agreement was the best transaction that could be obtained by IXYS stockholders from Littelfuse at the time, and that there was no

Table of Contents

assurance that a more favorable opportunity to sell IXYS would arise later or through any alternative transaction.

• Stockholder Election Opportunity. The fact that IXYS stockholders would have the right to elect to receive the merger consideration either in cash or shares of
Littelfuse common stock, subject to proration. 

• Significant Portion of Merger Consideration in Cash. The fact that 50% of the merger consideration will be paid in cash, giving IXYS stockholders the
opportunity to immediately realize value for a significant portion of their investment and providing certainty of value. The IXYS board of directors also
considered the fact that IXYS stockholders would be able to reinvest the cash consideration received in the merger in shares of Littelfuse common stock if they
desired to do so. 

• Participation in Potential Upside. The benefits of the combined company that could result from the merger, including the potential to realize synergies. The fact
that, since a portion of the merger consideration will be paid in Littelfuse common stock, IXYS stockholders will benefit from an approximately 8% pro forma
continuing equity ownership in Littelfuse (based on share data of IXYS and Littelfuse on August 25, 2017) and have the opportunity to participate in any future
earnings or growth of the combined company and future appreciation in the value of Littelfuse common stock following the merger should they determine to
retain the Littelfuse common stock payable in the merger. 

• Fixed Exchange Ratio for Stock Portion of Merger Consideration. The fact that because the stock consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.1265 of a
share of Littelfuse common stock, IXYS stockholders receiving the stock consideration will have the opportunity to benefit from any increase in the trading price
of shares of Littelfuse common stock between the announcement of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger and that the cash portion of the
merger consideration will limit the impact of a decline in the trading price of Littelfuse common stock on the aggregate value of the merger consideration. 

• Tax Treatment. The fact that the merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and, assuming the merger so
qualifies, a holder who exchanges shares of IXYS common stock solely for stock consideration generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, other than in respect of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock. 

• Expected Cost Synergies. The expectation that the combined company will recognize anticipated annualized cost synergies following consummation of the
proposed transaction, which IXYS stockholders will benefit from as continuing stockholders of Littelfuse. The IXYS board of directors also considered that there
could be no assurance that any particular amount of such synergies would be achieved following completion of the merger or the timeframe in which they would
be achieved. 

• Financial Advisor's Financial Analyses and Opinion. The oral opinion rendered by representatives of Needham & Company to the IXYS board of directors on
August 25, 2017, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and
other matters set forth in its written opinion, as described under "—Opinion of IXYS' Financial Advisor" beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement/prospectus,
the merger consideration of either $23.00 in cash per IXYS share or 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock per IXYS share to be received by the holders of
shares of IXYS common stock (other than the holders of cancelled shares and dissenting shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders. The exchange ratio of 0.1265 was derived by dividing the cash consideration of $23.00 by the volume weighted average price per share
of Littelfuse common stock for a pre-determined trading

period prior to the signing of the merger agreement, which the IXYS board of directors believed to be a fair representation of the implied value of the per share
stock consideration. The IXYS board of directors considered that Needham & Company, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses based on the per share cash consideration of $23.00 (which was considered by the IXYS board of directors to be
approximately equal to the implied value of the per share stock consideration and not materially different from the implied value of the per share stock
consideration based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017, the date of the opinion rendered by Needham & Company) and
performed the selected companies analysis set forth in the section below entitled "The Merger—Opinion of IXYS' Financial Advisor—Littelfuse Selected
Companies Analysis" using the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017.

• Likelihood of Consummation. The likelihood that the merger would be completed, in light of, among other things, the conditions to the merger, the absence of a
financing condition, the efforts required to obtain regulatory approvals, and the provisions of the merger agreement in the event of various breaches by Littelfuse. 

• Board Representation. That Dr. Zommer will join the Littelfuse board of directors. 

• Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including: 

• the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger and their ability to terminate
the merger agreement; 

• the provisions of the merger agreement that allow IXYS to engage in negotiations with, and provide information to, a third party that makes an unsolicited
written bona fide proposal relating to an alternative transaction, if the IXYS board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that is superior to the
proposed transaction with Littelfuse and IXYS complies with certain procedural requirements; 

• the provisions of the merger agreement that allow the IXYS board of directors to change its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement in response to a company superior proposal and/or terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a company superior proposal if the IXYS
board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that a proposal relating to an
alternative transaction constitutes a company superior proposal (including taking into account any modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that
are proposed by Littelfuse and, in connection with the termination of the merger agreement, payment to Littelfuse of a $28.5 million termination fee),
subject to IXYS' compliance with certain procedural requirements; 

• the provisions of the merger agreement that allow the IXYS board of directors to change its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement (other than in response to the receipt of a written unsolicited bona fide proposal relating to an alternative transaction, which is subject to the
preceding sub-bullet above) if the IXYS board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its directors' fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to the terms of the merger
agreement that are proposed by Littelfuse), subject to IXYS' compliance with certain procedural requirements; 

• the belief of the IXYS board of directors that the termination fee provisions were not likely to unduly discourage competing third-party proposals or
reduce the price of such proposals, that such provisions are customary for transactions of this size and type, and that the $28.5 million termination fee,
representing approximately 3.8% of the equity value implied by the proposed transaction, was reasonable in the context of comparable transactions; and

• Strategic Alternatives. The IXYS board of directors, with the assistance of representatives of Needham & Company, considered the strategic and business
considerations relating to a potential transaction with Littelfuse and the risks and benefits of a potential transaction compared to other potential strategic
alternatives and concluded that while each of such other potential alternatives had a variety of qualitative factors that could make it attractive or cause concerns, a
potential transaction with Littelfuse would likely deliver value to IXYS stockholders that was higher than the values that could be achieved for IXYS stockholders
in other potential strategic alternatives. 

• Absence of Competing Offers.  The IXYS board of directors noted that, other than the Company A Proposal, IXYS had not received any bona fide written
proposals concerning alternative transactions. The IXYS board of directors also believed that the benefits of soliciting interest from other potential parties were
outweighed by a number of risks, including that such solicitation would further increase market speculation and jeopardize or, at a minimum, delay the proposed
transaction with Littelfuse. The IXYS board of directors also observed that, in the event that any third party were to seek to make such proposal, IXYS retained
the ability to consider unsolicited proposals after the execution of the merger agreement until the meeting of the IXYS stockholders to vote on the merger proposal
and to enter into an agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal under certain circumstances (concurrently with terminating the merger agreement
and paying a $28.5 million termination fee to Littelfuse). 

• Littelfuse's Business and Reputation.  The results of the due diligence investigation that IXYS' senior management conducted with the assistance of its advisors on
Littelfuse with respect to certain matters and Littelfuse's business reputation and capabilities of Littelfuse and its management. 

• Financing Strength of Littelfuse.  The likelihood that Littelfuse would be able to finance the merger given Littelfuse's financial resources and financial profile. 

• Availability of Appraisal Rights.  The fact that appraisal rights would be available to holders of IXYS common stock under Delaware law and that there was no
condition in the merger agreement relating to the maximum number of shares of IXYS common stock that could dissent from the merger. 

• Stockholders' Ability to Reject the Merger.  The IXYS board of directors considered the fact that the merger is subject to approval by IXYS stockholders.

        The IXYS board of directors also considered certain potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, including the following:

• Fixed Stock Ratio of Merger Consideration.  The fact that because the stock portion of the merger consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Littelfuse
common stock to IXYS common stock, IXYS stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of Littelfuse common stock during the
pendency of the merger, and the fact that the merger agreement does not provide IXYS with a termination right or other similar protection relating to the trading
price of Littelfuse common stock. The IXYS board of directors determined that this structure was appropriate and the risk acceptable in view of factors such as: 

• the IXYS board of directors' review of the relative intrinsic values and financial performance of Littelfuse and IXYS; and 

• the fact that IXYS stockholders may elect cash consideration, subject to proration, which limits the impact of a decline in the trading price of Littelfuse
common stock on the value of the merger consideration.

Table of Contents

• Possible Failure to Achieve Synergies.  The risk that the potential benefits and synergies sought in the merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the
expected time period, and the risk associated with the integration by Littelfuse of IXYS. 

• Smaller Ongoing Equity Participation in the Combined Company by IXYS Stockholders.  The fact that because only 50% of the merger consideration will be in
the form of Littelfuse common stock, IXYS stockholders will have a smaller ongoing equity participation in the combined company (and, as a result, a smaller
opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the combined company and future appreciation in the value of Littelfuse common stock following
the merger) than they have in IXYS. 

• Risk of Non-Completion.  The possibility that the merger might not be completed, including as a result of the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the failure
of IXYS stockholders to approve the merger proposal, and the effect the resulting public announcement of the termination of the merger agreement may have on: 

• the trading price of IXYS common stock; and 

• IXYS' business and operating results, particularly in light of the costs incurred in connection with the transaction. 

• Possible Deterrence of Competing Offers.  The risk that various provisions of the merger agreement, including the requirement that IXYS must pay to Littelfuse a
termination fee of $28.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, may discourage other parties potentially interested in an
acquisition of, or combination with, IXYS from pursuing that opportunity. 

• Possible Disruption of the Business and Costs and Expenses.  The possible disruption to IXYS' business that may result from the merger, the resulting distraction
of IXYS' management and potential attrition of IXYS' employees, as well as the costs and expenses associated with completing the merger. 

• Restrictions on Operation of IXYS' Business.  The requirement that IXYS conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course prior to completion
of the merger and subject to specified restrictions unless Littelfuse provides its prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), which might delay or prevent IXYS from undertaking certain business opportunities that might arise pending completion of the merger. 

• Other Risks.  The risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        The IXYS board of directors concluded that the potentially negative factors associated with the proposed merger were significantly outweighed by the potential benefits that
it expected the IXYS stockholders would achieve as a result of the merger, including the belief of the IXYS board of directors that the proposed merger would maximize the
immediate value of IXYS stockholders' shares and minimize the risks and uncertainty affecting the future prospects of IXYS, including the potential execution risks associated
with its stand-alone financial plan. Accordingly, the IXYS board of directors determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, IXYS
and IXYS stockholders.

        In addition, the IXYS board of directors was aware of and considered the interests that IXYS' directors and executive officers may have with respect to the merger that differ
from, or are in addition to, the interests of stockholders of IXYS generally, as described under "—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning
on page 75 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the IXYS board of directors is not exhaustive, but IXYS believes it includes all the material factors
considered by the IXYS board of directors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters,
the IXYS board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors.
Rather, the IXYS board of directors viewed its position and recommendation as being based on an overall analysis and on the totality of the information presented to and factors
considered by it. In addition, in considering the factors described above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. After considering this
information, the IXYS board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger and recommended that IXYS stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

        This explanation of IXYS' reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the
factors described under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 30 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Certain Financial Projections Utilized by the IXYS Board of Directors and IXYS' Financial Advisor 

        In the ordinary course, each year IXYS management prepares certain unaudited prospective financial information for the subsequent fiscal year for internal budgeting and
business planning purposes. The annual budget forecast for fiscal year 2018 was prepared by management in May 2017 (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
2018 budget forecast).

        Although IXYS has publicly issued limited quarterly guidance concerning IXYS management's expectations regarding financial performance for the subsequent fiscal
quarter, it does not, as a matter of course, make public disclosure of detailed forecasts or projections of its expected financial performance for extended periods due to, among
other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting future periods; and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect.

        For internal purposes and in connection with the process leading to the merger agreement, IXYS management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information
for the fiscal years 2018 through 2020 (referred to in this proxy statement / prospectus as the initial management forecast). The initial management forecast differed from the
2018 budget forecast in that it reflected the information then available to IXYS management and included prospective financial information for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 based
on management estimates for growth rates for revenues. In using current financial information, IXYS management estimated that its revenues would increase by approximately
5% to 6% per year. Based on estimated growth in revenues, IXYS management also assumed that its gross margins would improve as it believed that its utilization of
manufacturing facilities would improve with increased production. IXYS also assumed that its operating expenses, excluding amortization of intangible assets, would continue to
be relatively constant, when expressed as a percentage of net revenues, over the three-year period of the initial management forecast. Amortization of intangible assets was
estimated at the remaining useful lives of those assets at the end of fiscal year 2017. Future capital expenditures and depreciation expenses were assumed to be relatively
consistent with historical experience. The initial management forecast was provided to Needham & Company on July 21, 2017 and made available to Littelfuse, Company A and
Company B with GAAP financial measures on July 21, 2017 and non-GAAP financial measures on July 25, 2017. The initial management forecast was included in the draft
materials presented by Needham & Company to the IXYS board of directors on July 26, 2017.

        The unaudited prospective financial information in the initial management forecast was revised to reflect the actual financial results of IXYS for the first quarter of fiscal
year 2018 ended June 30, 2017

(referred to in this proxy statement / prospectus as the final management forecast). The final management forecast was the only forecast discussed herein that was relied on by
Needham & Company in connection with its opinion and related financial analyses that were presented to the IXYS board of directors on August 25, 2017. The presentation to
the IXYS board of directors included unlevered free cash flows for IXYS for the projected six months ending March 31, 2018 and the projected fiscal years ending March 31,
2019 and 2020 derived by Needham & Company from the final management forecast for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis as summarized below under "—Opinion
of IXYS' Financial Advisor."

        IXYS is including the final management forecast in this proxy statement / prospectus solely because it was the most recent financial information used by Needham &
Company in connection with its financial analyses summarized below under "—Opinion of IXYS' Financial Advisor" and made available to the IXYS board of directors in
connection with its evaluation of the merger and because, other than reflecting IXYS' actual financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the final management forecast
reflected the same results as the initial management forecast made available to Littelfuse, Company A and Company B. The IXYS board of directors did not rely on any forecasts
other than the final management forecast in reaching its determination on August 25, 2017 to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and to
recommend that IXYS' stockholders vote for the merger proposal.

        The final management forecast was based solely upon information available to IXYS management, and estimates and assumptions made by IXYS management, at the time
when the final management forecast was prepared. As a result, the final management forecast does not necessarily reflect IXYS' current estimates and does not take into account
any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared, and some or all of the assumptions made regarding, among other things, the timing of certain occurrences or
impacts, may have changed since such date. In addition, the final management forecast does not give effect to the merger or any changes to IXYS' operations or strategy that may
be implemented as a result of the announcement of the merger or following the consummation of the merger or to any costs incurred in connection with the merger. Further, the
final management forecast does not take into account the effect of any failure of the consummation of the merger to occur and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in
that context.

        The final management forecast was necessarily based on a variety of assumptions and estimates. All such estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond IXYS' control. The final management
forecast does not necessarily reflect IXYS' current estimates and does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared, and certain of
these assumptions and estimates may not be realized. In addition, the final management forecast covers multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes more
uncertain with each successive year. Moreover, the final management forecast is based on certain future business decisions that are subject to change. The inclusion of the final
management forecast in this proxy statement / prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that such unaudited prospective financial information will be predictive of
actual future results, and the final management forecast should not be relied upon as such. The final management forecast is a forward-looking statement. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that any of the assumptions and estimates used to prepare the final management forecast will necessarily prove to be accurate, and actual results may differ
materially from those shown in the final management forecast.

        The final management forecast is not being included in this proxy statement / prospectus in order to influence any IXYS stockholder's decision as to whether or not to
approve the merger or whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to shares of IXYS common stock held by such stockholder. The inclusion of the final management
forecast in this proxy statement / prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that IXYS or any of IXYS' respective advisors or representatives considered

such. None of IXYS or any of IXYS' advisors or representatives has made or makes any representation regarding the information contained in the final management forecast or
assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the final management forecast included in this proxy statement / prospectus. In particular,

with the historical financial statements of IXYS, which have been filed with the SEC, and the other information regarding IXYS contained elsewhere and incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement / prospectus.

        EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, NONE OF IXYS OR ANY OF IXYS' ADVISORS OR REPRESENTATIVES INTENDS
TO, AND DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO, UPDATE, CORRECT OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE FINAL MANAGEMENT FORECAST TO
REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING OR EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER THE DATE WHEN SUCH FINAL MANAGEMENT FORECAST WERE PREPARED,
EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FINAL MANAGEMENT FORECAST ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.
IXYS' STOCKHOLDERS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE FINAL MANAGEMENT FORECAST INCLUDED IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT / PROSPECTUS.

        The final management forecast was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the
SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The final
management forecast does not purport to present operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and IXYS' independent registered public accounting firm has not audited, reviewed,

nor have they expressed any opinion or given any form of assurance with respect to such information or its reasonableness, achievability or accuracy, and accordingly such
registered public accounting firm assumes no responsibility therefor. The final management forecast includes non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are
not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance

        The table below presents IXYS management's reconciliation of the non-GAAP prospective financial information included in the final management forecast to the most
comparable GAAP financial measure for fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Opinion of IXYS' Financial Advisor 

        IXYS retained Needham & Company to act as IXYS' financial advisor in connection with the merger agreement and to render an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of IXYS common stock (other than cancelled shares and dissenting shares) of the consideration to be received by those holders pursuant to the
merger agreement.

        On August 25, 2017, Needham & Company delivered its oral opinion, which it subsequently confirmed in writing, to the IXYS board of directors that, as of that date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions and other matters set forth in the written opinion, the consideration of $23.00 in cash or 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock
per share of IXYS common stock to be received by the holders of IXYS common stock (other than holders of cancelled shares and dissenting shares) pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to those holders. Needham & Company provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the IXYS board of
directors in connection with and for the purpose of the IXYS board of directors' evaluation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Needham &
Company's opinion relates only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of IXYS common stock (other than holders of cancelled shares and
dissenting shares) of the merger consideration, which was determined through arm's-length negotiations between IXYS and Littelfuse. While Needham & Company
provided independent financial advice to the IXYS board of directors during the course of the negotiations between IXYS and Littelfuse, the decision to approve and
recommend the merger was made

independently by the IXYS board of directors. Needham & Company's opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger, or any related transaction, and does
not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of IXYS as to whether that stockholder should elect to receive the cash consideration or the stock consideration, or
make no such election, or how that stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the merger. Needham & Company's opinion does not express any opinion
as to the value of Littelfuse common stock when issued pursuant to the merger or the prices at which IXYS common stock or Littelfuse common stock will actually
trade at any time.

        The complete text of Needham & Company's opinion, dated August 25, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on and scope of the review undertaken by Needham & Company, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of
Needham & Company's opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Holders of IXYS common stock should read this opinion
carefully and in its entirety.

        In arriving at its opinion, Needham & Company, among other things:

• reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated August 25, 2017; 

• reviewed certain publicly available information concerning IXYS and Littelfuse and certain other relevant financial and operating data of IXYS and Littelfuse
furnished to Needham & Company by IXYS and Littelfuse; 

• reviewed the historical stock prices and trading volumes of the shares of IXYS common stock and Littelfuse common stock; 

• held discussions with members of management of IXYS and Littelfuse concerning the current operations of and future business prospects for IXYS and Littelfuse
and joint prospects for the combined companies, including the potential cost savings and other synergies that may be achieved by the combined companies; 

• reviewed certain financial forecasts with respect to IXYS prepared by the management of IXYS and held discussions with members of such management
concerning those forecasts; 

• reviewed certain research analyst projections with respect to Littelfuse and held discussions with members of the management of Littelfuse concerning those
projections; 

• compared certain publicly available financial data of companies whose securities are traded in the public markets and that Needham & Company deemed
generally relevant to similar data for IXYS and Littelfuse; 

• reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations that Needham & Company deemed generally relevant; and 

• reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other matters as Needham & Company deemed appropriate.

        In connection with its review and in arriving at its opinion, Needham & Company assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, accounting,
legal, tax and other information discussed with or reviewed by it for purposes of its opinion and did not independently verify, nor did Needham & Company assume
responsibility for independent verification of, any of that information. Needham & Company assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger
agreement and all agreements related thereto. In addition, Needham & Company assumed that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and that the merger will be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the draft merger agreement furnished to
Needham & Company without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement

be imposed that would have an adverse effect on IXYS, Littelfuse or the contemplated benefits of the merger. Needham & Company assumed that the financial forecasts for
IXYS provided to Needham & Company by management of IXYS were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such
management, at the time of preparation, of the future operating and financial performance of IXYS. Needham & Company relied, without independent verification, upon the
estimates of management of IXYS and Littelfuse of the potential cost savings and other synergies, including the amount and timing thereof, that may be achieved as a result of
the merger. Needham & Company also assumed, based on discussions with the management of Littelfuse, that the research analyst projections for Littelfuse represent reasonable
estimates of the future financial performance of Littelfuse. Needham & Company expressed no opinion with respect to any of those forecasts, (including those cost savings and
other synergies), estimates or projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

        Needham & Company did not assume any responsibility for or make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or liabilities of
IXYS, Littelfuse or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Needham & Company evaluate the solvency or fair value of IXYS, Littelfuse or any of their respective
subsidiaries under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Needham & Company's opinion states that it was based on economic, monetary
and market conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of its date, and Needham & Company assumed no responsibility to update or revise its opinion based upon
circumstances and events occurring after its date. Needham & Company's opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of IXYS common stock
(other than holders of cancelled shares and dissenting shares) of the merger consideration to be received by those holders pursuant to the merger agreement and Needham &
Company expressed no opinion with respect to any other terms or aspects of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, the form of the merger
consideration, the allocation of the merger consideration as between holders of IXYS common stock who receive the stock consideration, the cash consideration or a combination
thereof or the relative fairness of the stock consideration and the cash consideration. In addition, Needham & Company expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the merger to,
or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of IXYS, or as to IXYS' underlying
business decision to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that might be available to IXYS. Needham & Company
also expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation payable to or to be received by any officers, directors or employees of
any party to the merger, or any class of those persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of IXYS common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or with
respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

        IXYS imposed no limitations on Needham & Company with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by Needham & Company in rendering its opinion.

        In preparing its opinion, Needham & Company performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The following paragraphs summarize the material financial
analyses performed by Needham & Company in arriving at its opinion. The order of analyses described does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses
by Needham & Company. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in
order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Needham & Company, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. The following
quantitative information, to the extent it is based on market data, is, except as otherwise indicated, based on market data as they existed on or prior to August 25, 2017, and is not

        Needham & Company calculated premiums for IXYS based on a merger consideration value of $23.00 per share and the closing prices per share of IXYS common stock
one day, five days, 30 days and 90 days prior to August 25, 2017. The following table sets forth information concerning the stock price premiums in the selected transactions and
the stock price premiums implied by the merger:

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Needham & Company performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis based on IXYS management's forecasts to determine
indicators of illustrative implied equity values for IXYS and illustrative implied equity values per share of common stock. Needham & Company calculated a range of indications
of the present value of unlevered free cash flows for IXYS for the projected six months ending March 31, 2018 and projected fiscal years ending March 31, 2019 and 2020 using
discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%. The range of discount rates, reflecting an estimated range of weighted average costs of capital of IXYS, was selected by Needham &
Company utilizing its professional judgment and experience. Needham & Company then calculated a range of illustrative terminal enterprise values at the end of the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2020 by applying multiples ranging from 7.0x to 10.0x to IXYS management's estimate of its fiscal year 2020 adjusted EBITDA. The range of multiples was
selected by Needham & Company utilizing its professional judgment and experience. These illustrative terminal enterprise values were then discounted to calculate ranges of
implied indications of present values using the same range of discount rates, 11.5% to 13.5%, as described above. Needham & Company then added the ranges of the implied
present values of IXYS' unlevered free cash flows for the projected periods to the ranges of implied present values of IXYS' terminal enterprise values to derive ranges of implied
present enterprise values of IXYS. Needham & Company then added IXYS' cash and subtracted IXYS' debt (including the unfunded portion of pension obligations) as of
June 30, 2017, to arrive at the ranges of illustrative implied present equity values. Needham & Company calculated the number of IXYS' estimated fully-diluted shares
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 based on IXYS management's estimates of 2.0% annual future share dilution to current stockholders resulting
from issuances of equity compensation awards, and divided the implied present equity values by this estimated fully-diluted outstanding share number. This analysis indicated an
illustrative implied per share equity reference range for IXYS of $15.22 to $20.65.

        Present Value of Illustrative Future Stock Prices Analysis.    Needham & Company performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per
share of IXYS common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company's equity.

        For this analysis, Needham & Company used IXYS management's forecasts. Needham & Company calculated the illustrative implied enterprise value for IXYS for each of
the projected fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 by applying illustrative multiples ranging from 7.0x to 10.0x to IXYS' projected fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, 2019 and
2020 adjusted EBITDA. The range of illustrative multiples was selected by Needham & Company utilizing its professional judgment and experience. Then Needham &
Company added IXYS' projected cash and subtracted IXYS' projected debt (including the unfunded portion of pension obligations) at the end of the respective projected fiscal
years 2018, 2019 and 2020 to derive ranges of implied equity values, and divided these implied equity values by the respective

numbers of projected fiscal year end fully-diluted outstanding shares to calculate ranges of implied future equity values per share of common stock for those fiscal years. The
assumed number of fully-diluted shares at the end of each projected fiscal year was based on IXYS management's estimates of 2.0% annual future share dilution to current
stockholders resulting from issuances of equity compensation awards. Needham & Company then in each case discounted these implied equity values per share back to
August 25, 2017 using discount rates ranging from 13.1% to 15.1%. The range of discount rates, reflecting an estimated range of IXYS' cost of equity, was selected by
Needham & Company utilizing its professional judgment and experience. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of $13.16 to $19.26.

        Littelfuse Selected Companies Analysis.    Using publicly available information, Needham & Company compared selected historical and projected financial and market
data ratios for Littelfuse to the corresponding data and ratios of the selected companies other than Littelfuse.

        The following table sets forth information concerning the following multiples for the selected companies other than Littelfuse and for Littelfuse:

• enterprise value as a multiple of LTM revenues; 

• enterprise value as a multiple of projected calendar year 2017 revenues; 

• enterprise value as a multiple of projected calendar year 2018 revenues; 

• enterprise value as a multiple of LTM EBITDA; 

• enterprise value as a multiple of projected calendar year 2017 adjusted EBITDA; 

• enterprise value as a multiple of projected calendar year 2018 adjusted EBITDA; 

• price as a multiple of non-GAAP LTM EPS; 

• price as a multiple of non-GAAP projected calendar year 2017 EPS; and 

• price as a multiple of non-GAAP projected calendar year 2018 EPS.

        Needham & Company calculated multiples for the selected companies other than Littelfuse using consensus research analyst estimates and based on the closing stock prices
of those companies on August 25, 2017. Needham & Company calculated multiples for Littelfuse using consensus analyst estimates from analysts and research reports identified
by Littelfuse management for use in analysis and based on the closing stock price of Littelfuse common stock on August 25, 2017. All financial

information excluded the impact of non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS amounts excluded the impact of stock-based compensation expense.

        Pro Forma Transaction Analysis.    Needham & Company prepared pro forma analyses of the financial impact of the merger based on the merger consideration, estimated
financial results of IXYS and Littelfuse for calendar year 2018, and an assumption of projected cost savings and other synergies resulting from the merger. The estimated
financial results for IXYS were based upon IXYS management's estimates and the estimated financial results for Littelfuse were based on consensus analyst estimates from
analysts and research reports identified by Littelfuse management for use in analysis. The estimated cost savings and other synergies, aggregating $15.0 million in calendar year
2018, were based on Littelfuse management's estimates. Based upon these estimates and assumptions, Needham & Company noted that the merger would result in accretion to
the estimated adjusted EPS of Littelfuse for calendar year 2018, which excludes the impact of non-recurring items but includes stock-based compensation as an expense. The
actual operating or financial results achieved by the combined entity may vary from estimated results, and these variations may be material.

        No company, transaction or business used in the "IXYS Selected Companies Analysis," "Selected Transactions Analysis," "Premiums Paid Analysis" or "Littelfuse Selected
Companies Analysis" as a comparison is identical to IXYS or Littelfuse or to the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of these analyses is not entirely mathematical;
rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in the financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition,
public trading or other values of the selected companies or selected transactions or the business segment, company or transaction to which they are being compared.

        The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Needham & Company in connection with the rendering of its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant quantitative and
qualitative methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to
summary description. Accordingly, Needham & Company believes that its analyses must

be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses or the factors that it considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. Needham & Company did not attribute any specific weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. The
fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.

        In performing its analyses, Needham & Company made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of IXYS or Littelfuse. Any estimates contained in or underlying these analyses, including estimates of IXYS' or Littelfuse's future
performance, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates.
Additionally, analyses relating to the values of businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be
sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. Needham & Company's opinion and its related analyses were only one of many factors considered by the members of the IXYS board of directors in their evaluation
of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the IXYS board of directors or management with respect to the merger consideration or the merger.

        Under the terms of its engagement letter with Needham & Company, IXYS has paid or agreed to pay Needham & Company a nonrefundable fee of $600,000 that became
payable upon Needham & Company's delivery of its opinion on August 25, 2017. If the merger is consummated, IXYS has agreed to pay Needham & Company an additional fee
estimated to be approximately $8 million. Whether or not the merger is consummated, IXYS has agreed to reimburse Needham & Company for certain of its out-of-pocket
expenses and to indemnify Needham & Company and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

        Needham & Company is a nationally recognized investment banking firm. As part of its investment banking services, Needham & Company is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private placements and
other purposes. Needham & Company believes that it was retained by the IXYS board of directors as IXYS' financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Needham &
Company's experience as a financial advisor in mergers and acquisitions as well as Needham & Company's familiarity with IXYS and its industry generally. Needham &
Company has not in the past two years provided investment banking or financial advisory services to IXYS unrelated to its current engagement with respect to the proposed
transaction for which it has received or is entitled to receive compensation. Needham & Company has not in the past two years provided investment banking or financial advisory
services to Littelfuse or Merger Sub for which it has received or is entitled to receive compensation. Needham & Company may in the future provide investment banking and
financial advisory services to IXYS, Littelfuse and their respective affiliates unrelated to the merger, for which services Needham & Company would expect to receive
compensation. In the normal course of its business, Needham & Company may actively trade equity securities of IXYS and Littelfuse for its own account or for the accounts of
its customers or affiliates and, therefore, may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities.

Form of Merger 

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS has agreed to be acquired by Littelfuse. If the merger agreement is adopted by IXYS stockholders and the other conditions
to closing under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into IXYS, with IXYS continuing as the surviving corporation in the initial
merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. Further to the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS, as the surviving corporation of the

Littelfuse.

Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        When considering the recommendation of the IXYS board of directors with respect to the merger, you should be aware that IXYS' directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of IXYS stockholders more generally. The IXYS board of directors was aware of these interests during its
deliberations on the merits of the merger and considered them in deciding to recommend that IXYS stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.

        As described below, the interests of IXYS' non-employee directors and executive officers include the following:

• accelerated vesting of 100% of the outstanding and unexercised stock options held by each non-employee director and executive officer upon the effective time; 

• a seat on Littelfuse's board of directors for Dr. Zommer following the effective time; 

• amended and restated employment agreements between IXYS and each executive officer, which will become effective upon the consummation of the merger, as
described in more detail below under "—Employment Agreements with Executive Officers"; 

• in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment upon or following the effective time, each executive officer will be entitled to receive certain
severance payments and benefits, as described in more detail under "—Employment Agreements with Executive Officers"; and 

• the right to indemnification and liability insurance coverage that will survive the completion of the merger.

        As described below in the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of IXYS Stock Options," at the effective time, each outstanding and unexercised IXYS stock
option will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into a Littelfuse stock option to acquire (i) that number of whole shares of Littelfuse common stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of IXYS common stock subject to such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time
multiplied by (y) 0.1265, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (x) the exercise price per
share of IXYS common stock of such IXYS stock option divided by (y) 0.1265. Each IXYS stock option assumed and converted into a Littelfuse stock option will continue to
have, and will be subject to, the same vesting schedule (including any accelerated vesting terms) and all other terms and conditions as applied to such IXYS stock option
immediately prior to the effective time.

        As described below under "—Employment Agreements with Executive Officers," pursuant to the terms of their amended and restated employment agreements with IXYS,
which will become effective upon the consummation of the merger, any outstanding and unexercised stock options held by Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson will vest and become
exercisable in full upon the effective time. Additionally, any outstanding and unexercised stock options held by IXYS' non-employee directors will vest and become exercisable
upon the effective time in accordance with their terms.

Table of Contents

        The table below shows the number of outstanding, unexercised and unvested stock options that are held by such individuals as of December 6, 2017 and the aggregate
intrinsic values of such unvested stock options. In accordance with applicable SEC rules, the dollar values below are based on a per share price of IXYS common stock of
$22.69, which is the average closing price of IXYS common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market over the first five business days following the first public
announcement of the merger on August 28 2017. The actual value of any executive officer's or non-employee director's unvested stock options as of the closing below will
depend on the number of shares of IXYS common stock underlying outstanding and unvested stock options held by such individuals as of the closing and, accordingly, may
differ from the values set forth below.

Littelfuse Board of Directors Following the Merger

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Littelfuse has agreed to cause the number of directors that will comprise the Littelfuse board of directors as of the effective time to be
increased by one member. Dr. Zommer will join the board of directors of Littelfuse, subject to his completion of the requisite documentation.

Amended Employment Agreements with Executive Officers

        On August 25, 2017, IXYS entered into (i) a Seventh Amended Executive Employment Agreement with Dr. Zommer pursuant to which he will serve as IXYS' Chief
Executive Officer, and (ii) a Fourth Amended Executive Employment Agreement with Mr. Sasson pursuant to which he will serve as IXYS' President, Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer (collectively referred to herein as the amended employment agreements), each of which will become effective upon the occurrence of a "change in
control" (as defined in IXYS' 2016 Equity Incentive Plan or any successor thereto) occurring on or prior to December 31, 2018. The amended employment agreements are
expected to become effective upon the closing of the merger (provided that the merger closes on or prior to December 31, 2018) and, upon their effectiveness, the amended
employment agreements will amend and restate the existing employment agreements for Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson in their entirety.

        Each amended employment agreement has an initial three-year term ending on the third anniversary of the effective date of such agreement, and will automatically be
extended for successive one-year periods thereafter unless either party elects not to renew the term of the amended employment agreement by notifying the other party in writing
of such election at least 90 days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.

        Pursuant to the amended employment agreement, Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson (together, the "executive officers") will receive an annual base salary of $525,000 and
$450,000, respectively, which is subject to increase, but not decrease, in IXYS' discretion. Each executive officer will be eligible for a

discretionary annual performance bonus and for stock options, restricted stock and/or other equity award grants in the discretion of the IXYS board of directors. The executive
officers will be eligible to participate in IXYS' retirement, health and welfare benefit plans and programs generally made available to IXYS' similarly situated executives from
time to time. Pursuant to their respective amended employment agreement, the executive officers will also entitled to (i) payment or reimbursement for reasonable costs of a
yearly medical exam, (ii) IXYS-maintained life insurance, (iii) payment or reimbursement for personal tax and/or investment advisor services (capped at $2,000 per year), and
(iv) either (A) an IXYS-provided car and reimbursement for the costs incurred in connection with the use of such car for business purposes or (B) payment of a monthly car
allowance (collectively, the "employment benefits").

        Each amended employment agreement provides that if the applicable executive officer's employment with IXYS is terminated by IXYS without "cause," by such executive
officer for "good reason" or due to a non-renewal of the term of the amended employment agreement by IXYS (provided that the executive officer is willing and able to continue
his employment on similar terms and conditions at such time), then, subject to the executive officer's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, the executive
officer will be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: (i) a lump-sum payment equal to three times the executive officer's average annual cash compensation over
the three prior years, payable within 60 days following termination; (ii) continued provision of employee benefits (including the employment benefits) (or their cash equivalent)
for 18 months following termination; and (iii) accelerated vesting of all stock options and other equity awards then-held by the executive officer.

        In the event of the applicable executive officer's "disability" (as defined in the amended employment agreement), the executive officer will be entitled to (i) continued
payment of his base salary for 18 months, and (ii) IXYS-provided health insurance (or its cash equivalent) and life insurance benefits for 18 months.

        Each employment agreement provides that, upon a "change in control" of IXYS, which will include the merger, all stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation
rights or other stock rights granted to the executive officer by IXYS will vest in full (to the extent then-unvested).

        To the extent that any payment, distribution or other benefit provided by IXYS to or for the benefit of the applicable executive officer in connection with a change in control
would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, such payments, distributions and/or benefits will be subject to a "best pay cap" reduction if such reduction
would result in a greater net after-tax benefit to the executive officer than receiving the full amount of such payments.

        See the section entitled "—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to IXYS' Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger" below for an estimate of
the value of the payments and benefits that Dr. Zommer and Mr. Sasson may become entitled to receive at the effective time and upon a qualifying termination of employment at
or following the effective time.

Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time in favor of
certain indemnified parties, including the directors and executive officers of IXYS, will survive the merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, as
set forth in the IXYS organizational documents or any indemnification agreements in existence upon execution of the merger agreement, for six years following the effective
time.

        Following the effective time, the surviving company will, and Littelfuse will cause the surviving company to, indemnify and hold harmless each IXYS indemnified party
against any cost or expense

arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of IXYS or any of its subsidiaries or other fiduciary in any entity at the request or for the benefit of IXYS and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring prior to the effective time (including with respect to the merger and merger agreement), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law.

        The merger agreement requires Littelfuse to cause the surviving company to maintain, for a period of six years after the effective time, IXYS' existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy, or substantially comparable insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured.

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to IXYS' Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger 

        The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about the
compensation that is payable or that may become payable to each named executive officer of IXYS that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. For additional details
regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption "—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger"
above.

        The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the
assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table. As a result, the amount, if any, that a named executive officer actually receives in the merger may materially differ
from the amounts set forth in the table. For purposes of calculating the amounts set forth in the table, the following assumptions were used:

• A per share price of IXYS common stock of $22.69, which is the average closing price of IXYS common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market over the
first five business days following the first public announcement of the merger on August 28, 2017; 

• The effective time of the merger is December 6, 2017; 

• Each of Dr. Zommer's and Mr. Sasson's employment was terminated either by IXYS without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (as such terms are
defined in the amended employment agreements), in either case, on or immediately following the effective time; and 

• Quantification of the accelerated vesting of stock options is calculated based on the outstanding, unexercised and unvested stock options held by the named
executive officer as of December 6, 2017.

Narrative Disclosure to Golden Parachute Compensation Table 

        Each of the executive officers holds outstanding, unexercised and unvested stock options to purchase shares of IXYS common stock that will vest and become exercisable,
and will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into options to purchase shares of Littelfuse common stock, upon the closing of the merger. For more information related to the
treatment of such stock options in connection with the merger, see the footnote disclosures above and the section titled "—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger" beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        IXYS is a party to an amended employment agreement with each of the executive officers, which are expected to become effective upon the closing of the merger, each of
which provides for severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of the executive officer's employment or upon a non-renewal of the term of the amended
employment agreement by IXYS. For more information

payments that the executive officers would be entitled to receive upon a termination of employment by IXYS without cause or by the executive officer
for good reason, in each case, assuming such termination occurred at or immediately following the effective time. The cash severance amounts represent
an amount equal to three times the executive officer's average annual cash compensation over the three prior years. The cash severance is payable in a
lump sum within 60 days following the date of termination. As a condition to receipt of such payments, the executive officers are required to timely
execute and not revoke a general release of claims.

For additional information regarding these amounts, see the section titled "—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger"
beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

(2) The estimated amounts listed in this column represent the aggregate intrinsic value of each executive officer's outstanding, unexercised and unvested
stock options that will accelerate as of the effective time pursuant to the applicable executive officer's amended employment agreement. Such benefit is
"single-trigger" (i.e., an amount triggered by a change in control for which payment is not conditioned upon a termination or resignation of the
executive officer). 

For additional information regarding the named executive officers' rights to accelerated vesting of stock options, see the section titled "—Interests of
IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

(3) The amounts listed in this column represent the estimated value of the "double-trigger" continued employment benefits that the executive officers would
be entitled to for up to 18 months following the executive officer's qualifying termination of employment following the effective time. 

For additional information regarding these amounts, see the section titled "—Interests of IXYS' Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger"
beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

(4) Each amended employment agreement includes a Code Section 280G "best pay" cutback, such that if any payments or benefits that an executive officer
is entitled to receive under his Employment Agreement or otherwise would constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code and
would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, the aggregate payments and benefits will either be delivered in full or delivered
in a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the aggregate payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt
by the executive officer of the greatest amount of aggregate payments and benefits on an after-tax basis. However, for purposes of this disclosure and
the table set forth above, IXYS has not taken into account any potential reduction in payments or benefits as a result of the "best pay" cutback provision
and, accordingly, has disclosed the full value of each executive officer's payments and benefits.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger 

        Littelfuse prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Littelfuse will be treated
as the acquiror for accounting purposes. Littelfuse will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from IXYS at their respective fair
values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described under Note 1—"Basis of Pro Forma Presentation" under "Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information—Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements Giving Effect to the Transaction" beginning on
page 119) over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.

        The financial condition and results of operations of Littelfuse after completion of the merger will reflect IXYS after completion of the merger, but will not be restated
retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or results of operations of IXYS. The earnings of Littelfuse following completion of the merger will reflect acquisition
accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and liabilities on depreciation expense, amortization expense and interest expense.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including certain trademarks, and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and
intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, Littelfuse determines that tangible or intangible assets
(including goodwill) are impaired, Littelfuse would record an impairment charge at that time.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

        The following general discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders (as defined below) of IXYS common stock that exchange
their IXYS common stock for the merger consideration in the initial merger. The discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings, published
positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the IRS) and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to
change and to differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect), and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set
forth in this discussion. This discussion applies only to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold their IXYS common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light
of his, her or its individual circumstances or to stockholders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including:

• banks or other financial institutions, 

• trusts, 

• tax exempt organizations, 

• governmental agencies or instrumentalities, 

• insurance companies, 

• dealers in securities or foreign currency, 

• traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, 

• mutual funds, 

• partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and investors in such entities,

• regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts, 

• broker-dealers, 

• holders liable for the alternative minimum tax, 

• holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, 

• holders who received their IXYS common stock through the exercise of employee stock options, through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as
compensation, 

• holders that exercise dissenters' rights, 

• holders that hold (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition of such holder's IXYS
common stock pursuant to the initial merger) 5% or more of the IXYS common stock, and 

• holders who hold IXYS common stock (or, after the initial merger, Littelfuse common stock) as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction
or other integrated investment.

        In addition, the discussion does not address any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the merger, nor does it address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net
investment income or any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. holder" or "holder" is a beneficial owner of IXYS common stock who is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

(i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

(ii) a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

(iii) an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; or 

(iv) a trust that (A) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all substantial decisions of which are subject to the control of one or
more "United States persons" (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (B) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        If a partnership, including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of IXYS common stock, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, such partners and
partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences of the merger to them.

        Each holder of IXYS common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences of the merger to such holder.

Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally

        The completion of the merger is conditioned upon the delivery by each of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (or other nationally recognized outside counsel), counsel to
Littelfuse, and Latham & Watkins LLP (or other nationally recognized outside counsel), counsel to IXYS, of its opinion to the

effect that the initial merger and the follow-on merger, taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In addition, in
connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this document is a part, each of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Latham & Watkins LLP has delivered an
opinion to Littelfuse and IXYS, respectively, to the same effect as the opinions described above. Accordingly, and on the basis of the foregoing opinions, as a result of the initial
merger and the follow-on merger, taken together, qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
U.S. holders who receive stock consideration and/or cash consideration in exchange for their shares of IXYS common stock pursuant to the merger agreement generally will be
as described below. The opinions of counsel will be based on factual representations contained in letters provided by Littelfuse and IXYS, and on certain customary factual
assumptions, all of which must continue to be true and accurate as of the consummation of the merger. These opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither
Littelfuse nor IXYS intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the
IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations or assumptions upon which those
opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected. The remainder of this discussion
assumes that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

        The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a holder generally will depend on whether the holder exchanges its IXYS common stock for cash consideration,
stock consideration or a combination of cash consideration and stock consideration.

Exchange Solely for Cash

        The exchange of shares of IXYS common stock solely for cash consideration generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss equal to the difference between the
amount of cash consideration received and the holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered, which gain or loss generally will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the holder's holding period with respect to the IXYS common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations. In some cases, if a holder actually or constructively owns Littelfuse common stock after the merger, the cash consideration received could be treated as
having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such holder may have dividend income up to the amount of the
cash consideration received. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the particular circumstances of a holder, including the application of certain
constructive ownership rules, holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences of the merger to them, and holders that are corporations should
consult their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of the Code.

        Holders electing to receive the all-cash consideration in the initial merger may be subject to proration (see the section titled "The Merger—Merger Consideration"), which
may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in stock consideration, in addition to cash consideration. See the section titled "—Exchange for Littelfuse
Common Stock and Cash" for a general description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of the receipt of stock consideration and cash consideration.

Exchange Solely for Littelfuse Common Stock

        If, pursuant to the initial merger, a holder exchanges all of its shares of IXYS common stock solely for stock consideration, that holder generally will not recognize any gain
or loss, except in respect of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock (as discussed in the section titled "—Cash

in Lieu of a Fractional Share"). The aggregate adjusted tax basis of the stock consideration received in the initial merger (including fractional shares deemed received and
redeemed as described below) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered, and the holding period of the stock
consideration (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described in the section titled "—Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share") will include the holding period
of the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered. If a holder acquired different blocks of shares of IXYS common stock at different times or different prices, such holder should
consult his, her or its tax advisor as to the determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the stock consideration received in the initial merger.

        Holders electing to receive the all-stock consideration in the initial merger may be subject to proration (see the section titled "The Merger—Merger Consideration"), which
may result in the receipt of a portion of the merger consideration in cash consideration, in addition to the stock consideration. See the section titled "—Exchange for Littelfuse
Common Stock and Cash" for a general description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of the receipt of stock consideration and cash consideration.

Exchange for Littelfuse Common Stock and Cash

        A holder who receives a combination of stock consideration and cash consideration (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock) pursuant to the
initial merger generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the amount of cash consideration (other than cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Littelfuse common stock) and the fair market value of the stock consideration, minus that holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of IXYS common stock
surrendered in exchange therefor and (2) the amount of cash consideration received.

        If a holder acquired different blocks of shares of IXYS common stock at different times or different prices, any gain or loss may be determined separately for each
identifiable block of shares. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the manner in which cash consideration and stock consideration should be allocated among
different blocks of shares of IXYS common stock surrendered and the determination of the tax bases and holding periods of the stock consideration received.

        Any recognized gain will generally be long-term capital gain if the holder's holding period with respect to the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered is more than one
year. In some cases, if a holder actually or constructively owns Littelfuse common stock after the merger, the recognized gain could be treated as having the effect of the
distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such holder may have dividend income up to the amount of the cash consideration
received. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the particular circumstances of a holder, including the application of certain constructive
ownership rules, holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences of the merger to them, and holders that are corporations should consult their
tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of the Code.

        The aggregate tax basis of the stock consideration received (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described in the section titled "—Cash in Lieu of a
Fractional Share") will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered, reduced by the amount of cash consideration received by
the holder (excluding any cash in lieu of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of gain (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash in lieu of a fractional share),
if any, recognized by the holder on the exchange. The holding period of the stock consideration (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described below)
will include the holding period of the shares of IXYS common stock surrendered.

        Holders receiving a combination of stock consideration and cash consideration should consult their tax advisors regarding the manner in which the above rules would apply
in the holder's particular circumstances.

Cash in Lieu of a Fractional Share

        A holder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock will generally be treated as having received such fractional share and then as having
received such cash in redemption of the fractional share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the difference between the amount of cash in lieu of the fractional
share and the tax basis allocated to such fractional share. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such shares is more than one
year. In some cases, if a holder actually or constructively owns Littelfuse common stock after the merger, the recognized gain could be treated as having the effect of the
distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such holder may have dividend income up to the amount of the cash consideration
received. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the particular circumstances of a holder, including the application of certain constructive
ownership rules, holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences of the merger to them, and holders that are corporations should consult their
tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the "extraordinary dividend" provisions of the Code.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the initial merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, if the
recipient provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable certification requirements. Any
amounts withheld may be allowed as a refund or credit against such holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

        This summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is for general information only and is not tax advice. Holders of IXYS common
stock should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger in light of their particular circumstances, including the applicability
and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals 

        Littelfuse, IXYS and Merger Sub have each agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable laws to consummate the merger and obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) the
required regulatory approvals. The following is a summary of the material regulatory approvals required for completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. There can be no assurance, however, if and when any of the approvals required to be obtained for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be
obtained or as to the conditions or limitations that such approvals may contain or impose.

United States Antitrust Clearance

        Under the HSR Act, and related rules, the merger may not be completed until each party files a Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all
statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. A transaction requiring notification under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day
waiting period following the parties' filing of their respective HSR Act Notification and Report Forms or the early termination of that waiting period. On September 18, 2017,
Littelfuse and IXYS filed their respective Notification and Report Forms and on October 2, 2017, the parties received early termination of the HSR waiting period.

Table of Contents

        U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest including without limitation seeking to enjoin
the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to the divestiture of assets of Littelfuse or IXYS or other remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal
action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such challenge is
made, that it would not be successful.

German Antitrust Clearance

        Under the merger agreement, the parties' obligations to complete the merger are also conditioned on the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under the antitrust/merger control laws of Germany. On September 25, 2017, Littelfuse and IXYS filed a notification
to satisfy the filing requirements in connection with obtaining the clearances and approvals applicable to the merger under the antitrust/merger control laws of Germany, and on
October 6, 2017, the parties received the required clearance.

Other Regulatory Approvals

        In addition to the regulatory approvals described above, the merger may require the approval of other governmental authorities under foreign regulatory laws, such as under
foreign merger control laws. If it is determined that other filings are required or advisable, it is possible that any of the governmental entities with which filings are made may
seek, as conditions for granting approval of the merger, various regulatory concessions. Neither Littelfuse nor IXYS is currently aware of any material governmental approvals or
actions that are required for completion of the merger other than those described above. It is currently contemplated that if any such additional material governmental approvals
or actions are required, those approvals or actions will be sought.

        Under the merger agreement, Littelfuse, IXYS and Merger Sub have each agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the merger and obtain the
regulatory approvals described above.

        For additional information, please see the section titled "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Merger" beginning on page 32.

Exchange of Shares; Elections As to Form of Consideration 

        At the effective time of the initial merger, each issued and outstanding share of IXYS common stock (other than (i) cancelled shares or (ii) dissenting shares) will be
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the stockholder and subject to proration, $23.00 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, or 0.1265
of a share of Littelfuse common stock. No fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock will be issued in the merger, and holders of IXYS common stock will instead receive cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock.

        Prior to the effective time of the initial merger, Littelfuse will appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to IXYS with respect to the exchange of shares of IXYS
common stock for the merger consideration. At or prior to the effective time, Littelfuse will deposit (i) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger
consideration and, to the extent determinable, cash in lieu of fractional shares and (ii) evidence of Littelfuse common stock in book-entry or certificated form representing the
number of shares of Littelfuse common stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate stock portion of the merger consideration.

        As described above, IXYS stockholders will not receive any fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock in the merger. Instead, a stockholder of IXYS who otherwise
would have received a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock will be entitled to receive, from the exchange agent appointed by

Littelfuse pursuant to the merger agreement, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the volume weighted average price per
share (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent) of Littelfuse common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, for the consecutive period of ten trading days
beginning on the opening of trading on the twelfth trading day immediately preceding the effective time and concluding at the close of trading on the third trading day
immediately preceding the effective time, as calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "VWAP" by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares
of IXYS common stock held by such holder at the effective time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Littelfuse common stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled, less any applicable withholding taxes.

        If a dividend or other distribution is declared with respect to shares of Littelfuse common stock with a record date after the effective time of the initial merger, such
declaration will include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Littelfuse common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement.

        The merger agreement provides that IXYS stockholders will be provided with a form of election and other customary transmittal materials. The form of election will allow
each holder of IXYS common stock to specify (i) the number of shares of IXYS common stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to receive the
cash consideration and (ii) the number of shares of IXYS common stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to receive the stock consideration.

        Littelfuse will initially make available and mail the form of election at least 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline to holders of record as of the business
day prior to such mailing date. Following the mailing date, Littelfuse will use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a form of election to any
stockholder who requests a form of election prior to the election deadline, regardless of whether the stockholder was a holder of record as of the business day prior to such
mailing date. The election deadline will be 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the exchange agent is located) on the date which Littelfuse and IXYS
agree is as near as practicable to two business days before the closing date of the transaction. IXYS and Littelfuse will cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to
each of them announcing the election deadline not more than 15 business days before, and at least five business days prior to, the election deadline.

        To make a valid election, an IXYS stockholder must submit to the exchange agent a properly completed and signed form of election (including duly executed transmittal
materials included in the form of election). The form of election must also be accompanied by any certificates representing all certificated shares of IXYS common stock to
which such form of election relates (or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such form of election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States).

        An IXYS stockholder may, at any time prior to the election deadline, change or revoke an election by written notice to the exchange agent received by the exchange agent
prior to the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised form of election, or by withdrawing his or her shares of IXYS common stock previously
deposited with the exchange agent. If any election is not properly made with respect to any shares of IXYS common stock, such election will be deemed to be not in effect, and
the shares of IXYS common stock covered by such election will be deemed to be non-election shares, unless a proper election is subsequently timely made.

        After the effective time of the initial merger, shares of IXYS common stock will no longer be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist and each certificate or
book entry share that previously represented shares of IXYS common stock (other than (i) cancelled shares or (ii) dissenting

shares) will represent only the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions,
if any, as described above. With respect to such shares of Littelfuse common stock deliverable upon the surrender of IXYS stock certificates or book-entry shares, until holders of
such IXYS stock certificates or book-entry shares have properly surrendered such stock certificates or book-entry shares to the exchange agent for exchange, along with a duly
completed letter of transmittal and any other documents as may customarily be required by the exchange agent, those holders will not receive the merger consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions that become due to the holders of converted IXYS common stock.

        Within five business days after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to each record holder of shares of IXYS common stock whose shares of IXYS common stock
were converted in the initial merger into the right to receive the merger consideration, and who has not previously submitted an election notice with duly executed transmittal
materials, a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering IXYS share certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon surrender of IXYS
share certificates or book-entry shares and a duly executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent in compliance with the instructions for surrender, Littelfuse will, in
exchange for such certificates or book-entry shares, cause the exchange agent to pay and deliver the merger consideration and any fractional share cash amounts.

        Littelfuse will instruct the exchange agent to pay the merger consideration and any fractional share cash amounts within five business days following the later to occur of
(i) the effective time and (ii) the exchange agent's receipt of the share certificate or book-entry share. The time that any individual stockholder receives its, his or her merger
consideration will vary depending on the underlying arrangements through which such stockholder holds its, his or her shares of IXYS common stock.

Dividend Policy 

        Littelfuse currently pays regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. Littelfuse most recently paid a cash dividend on September 7, 2017, of $0.37 per share.
Littelfuse currently expects to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by Littelfuse's board of directors. The
payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including Littelfuse's financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

        IXYS pays quarterly cash dividends on its common stock at the discretion of its board of directors. IXYS most recently paid a cash dividend on July 5, 2016 of $0.04 per
share. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on IXYS' financial performance.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period before the closing of the merger, Littelfuse is not permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions on its
capital stock other than quarterly cash dividends not exceeding $0.37 per share, and IXYS is not permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock, in
each case without the consent of the other party.

Listing of Littelfuse Common Stock; Delisting of IXYS Common Stock 

        It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that the shares of Littelfuse common stock to be issued to IXYS stockholders in the merger be approved for listing on
The NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance. As a result of the merger, shares of IXYS common stock will cease to be listed on The NASDAQ
Global Select Market.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference
herein. The summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. Littelfuse and
IXYS encourage you to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger as it is the legal document governing the merger.

        The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. Littelfuse and IXYS
are responsible for considering whether additional disclosure of material information is required to make the statements in this proxy statement/prospectus not misleading.
Factual disclosures about Littelfuse and IXYS contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or Littelfuse's or IXYS' public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or
modify the factual disclosures about Littelfuse or IXYS contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations, warranties and covenants made in
the merger agreement by Littelfuse, Merger Sub and IXYS are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the parties to the merger agreement in connection with
negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this
summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, and were negotiated
with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also
be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from that generally relevant to stockholders or applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC,
and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not publicly disclosed. The representations and
warranties in the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may
have changed since the date of the merger agreement. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should
not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 151.

Closing; Effective Time 

        The merger agreement provides that the closing of the merger (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the closing) will take place at 10 a.m., New York City time,
on the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions to the closing to be satisfied or waived (other than such conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied by action taken at or immediately prior to the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or permitted waiver of such conditions at the closing), unless another date is
agreed to in writing by Littelfuse and IXYS. The date on which the closing occurs is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the closing date. The merger agreement
provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the closing date occur prior to January 2, 2018 without the prior written consent of Littelfuse and IXYS.

        The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions in the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the initial
merger, sometimes referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into IXYS, with IXYS surviving the initial merger as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. The initial merger will be effective at the time the parties file a certificate of merger with respect to the initial merger, referred to in this
proxy statement/prospectus as the initial certificate of merger, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, unless the parties agree to a later time for the completion

of the initial merger and specify that time in the initial certificate of merger. At the effective time of the initial merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of IXYS and Merger Sub will vest in IXYS, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of IXYS and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of IXYS.

        The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions in the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the
follow-on merger, IXYS will be merged with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two surviving the follow-on merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse. The
follow-on merger will be effective at the time the parties file a certificate of merger with respect to the follow-on merger, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
follow-on certificate of merger, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, unless the parties agree to a later time for the completion of the follow-on merger and specify
that time in the follow-on certificate of merger. At the effective time of the follow-on merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of IXYS and Merger
Sub Two will vest in Merger Sub Two as the surviving company, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of IXYS and Merger Sub Two will become the debts, liabilities and
duties of Merger Sub Two, sometimes referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the surviving company.

        The merger agreement provides that the effective time of the follow-on merger will be immediately following the effective time of the initial merger.

        On December 4, 2017, Littelfuse and IXYS amended the merger agreement to provide that the follow-on merger will be a merger of IXYS with and into Merger Sub Two (a
wholly owned disregarded limited liability company subsidiary of Littelfuse). The original merger agreement, entered into on August 25, 2017, provided that the follow-on
merger would be a merger of IXYS with and into Littelfuse but that, subject to certain exceptions, Littelfuse could at any time prior to the closing change the method of effecting
the merger, including by causing the follow-on merger to be a merger of IXYS with and into a wholly owned disregarded limited liability company subsidiary of Littelfuse. The
amendment to the merger agreement provided for such change to the method of effecting the merger by providing that the follow-on merger will be a merger of IXYS with and
into Merger Sub Two (rather than with and into Littelfuse). Also, the amendment to the merger agreement joined Merger Sub Two as a party to the merger agreement.

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock 

        At the effective time, subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock as described below under "—No Fractional Shares" and proration
as described below under "—Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration," each share of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time, other than cancelled shares and dissenting shares as described below under "—Cancellation of Certain IXYS Common Stock" and "—Shares of Dissenting Stockholders,"
respectively, will be converted into the right to receive, less any applicable withholding tax and without interest:

• for each share of IXYS common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (referred to as a cash election) has been effectively made and not revoked
(referred to as a cash election share), $23.00 in cash (referred to as the cash consideration); 

• for each share of IXYS common stock with respect to which an election to receive Littelfuse common stock (referred to as a stock election) has been effectively
made and not revoked (referred to as a stock election share), 0.1265 of a share of Littelfuse common stock (referred to as the stock consideration); and 

• for each share of IXYS common stock that is not a cash election share or a stock election share (referred to as a non-election share), the right to receive cash
consideration or stock

consideration as determined in accordance with the proration methodology described below under "—Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration."

        The stock consideration will be equitably and proportionally adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares or any similar event with respect to the outstanding shares of Littelfuse common stock or of IXYS common stock that occurs prior to the
effective time.

No Fractional Shares

        Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Littelfuse common stock as described in the next sentence. Each holder of IXYS common stock that would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fractional share of Littelfuse common stock in the initial merger will instead receive a cash payment equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fraction of a share of Littelfuse common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (accounting for all shares of IXYS common stock held by such holder at the
effective time), rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of one share, by (ii) the volume weighted average price per share, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent, of
Littelfuse common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the consecutive period of ten trading days beginning on the opening of trading on the 12th trading day
immediately preceding the effective time and concluding at the close of trading on the third trading day immediately preceding the effective time, as calculated by Bloomberg
Financial LP under the function "VWAP."

Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration

        The total number of shares of IXYS common stock to be entitled to receive the cash consideration, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the maximum cash share
number, will be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than any cancelled
shares). Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other holders of IXYS common stock, a holder of IXYS common stock may receive a portion of the merger
consideration in the form such holder did not elect.

        Within five business days after the effective time, Littelfuse will cause the exchange agent for the payment of the merger consideration, referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the exchange agent, to effect the allocation among holders of IXYS common stock of rights to receive the cash consideration and the stock consideration
as follows (with the exchange agent to determine, consistent with the immediately preceding paragraph, whether fractions of cash election shares, stock election shares and non-
election shares, as applicable, will be rounded up or down):

Oversubscription of Cash Election Option.    If the aggregate number of cash election shares (including, for this purpose, dissenting shares as of the effective
time), referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the cash election number, exceeds the maximum cash share number, then

• the cash election shares of each holder of such cash election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in respect of that
number of cash election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of cash election shares held by such holder by (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the maximum cash share number and the denominator of which is the cash election number, with the remaining number of such
holder's cash election shares being converted into the right to receive the stock consideration; 

• all stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration; and 

• all non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration.

Undersubscription of Cash Election Option.    If the cash election number is less than the maximum cash share number (the amount by which the maximum cash
share number exceeds the cash election number referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the shortfall number), then

• all cash election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration; 

• if the shortfall number is less than or equal to the number of non-election shares, then all stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive
the stock consideration, and the non-election shares of each holder of such non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash
consideration in respect of that number of non-election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of non-election shares held by
such holder by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall number and the denominator of which is the total number of non-election shares, with
the remaining number of such holder's non-election shares being converted into the right to receive the stock consideration; and 

• if the shortfall number exceeds the number of non-election shares, then all non-election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash
consideration, and stock election shares of each holder of such stock election shares will be converted into the right to receive the cash consideration in
respect of that number of stock election shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of stock election shares held by such holder by
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the shortfall number exceeds the total number of non-election shares, and the denominator
of which is the total number of stock election shares, with the remaining number of such holder's stock election shares being converted into the right to
receive the stock consideration.

        At the effective time, each share of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time that is owned or held in treasury by IXYS or owned
by Littelfuse or Merger Sub, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as cancelled shares, will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. No consideration will be
delivered in exchange for any cancelled shares.

Shares of Dissenting Stockholders

        Shares of IXYS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a person, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as a
dissenting stockholder, (i) who did not vote in favor of approval of the merger proposal, (ii) who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of IXYS
common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) who complies in all respects with the provisions of the DGCL concerning the rights of IXYS stockholders to
require payment by the surviving company of the "fair value" of such shares of IXYS common stock, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as dissenting shares, will not
be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

        Instead, if the initial merger is consummated, then dissenting shares will represent the right to receive whatever consideration may be determined to be due to such
dissenting stockholder under Section 262 of the DGCL. If any dissenting stockholder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws or otherwise loses appraisal rights (or a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to exercise appraisal rights), dissenting shares held by such dissenting stockholder will be treated as though such
dissenting shares had been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration as of the effective time. For more information regarding appraisal rights, see the section of
this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Appraisal Rights of IXYS Stockholders." In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex D to this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers

        At the effective time of the initial merger, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will be the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of IXYS, until the effective time of the follow-on merger. At the effective time of the follow-on merger, the limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub Two, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will be the limited liability company agreement of the surviving company.

        At the effective time of the initial merger, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors and officers of IXYS. At the
effective time of the follow-on merger, the managers of Merger Sub Two immediately prior to the effective time of the follow-on merger will be the initial managers of the
surviving company.

Election Procedures 

        Each holder of shares of IXYS common stock to be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as a holder,
may specify in a request made in accordance with the procedures described in this "—Election Procedures" section (i) the number of shares of IXYS common stock owned by
such holder with respect to which such holder desires to make a stock election and (ii) the number of shares of IXYS common stock owned by such holder with respect to which
such holder desires to make a cash election. Any such request is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as an election.

        The merger agreement provides that Littelfuse will prepare a form reasonably acceptable to IXYS, including appropriate and customary transmittal materials, referred to in
this proxy statement/prospectus as the form of election, so as to permit holders to exercise their right to make an election.

        Littelfuse (i) will initially make available and mail the form of election not less than 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline (as defined below) to holders
of record of IXYS common stock as of the business day prior to such mailing date, and (ii) following such mailing date, will use all reasonable efforts to make available as
promptly as possible a form of election to any IXYS stockholder who requests such form of election prior to the election deadline. The time period between such mailing date
and the election deadline is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the election period.

        Any election will have been made properly only if the exchange agent will have received, during the election period, a form of election properly completed and executed
(including duly executed transmittal materials included in the form of election) and accompanied by any certificates representing all certificated shares to which such form of
election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such form of election, from a member of any registered national securities
exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States.

        Unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties to the merger agreement, election deadline means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
exchange agent is located) on the date which the parties agree is as near as practicable to two business days preceding the closing date. Littelfuse and IXYS will cooperate to
issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the election deadline not more than 15 business days before, and at least five business days
prior to, the election deadline.

        Any holder may, at any time during the election period, change or revoke his, her or its election by written notice to the exchange agent prior to the election deadline
accompanied by a properly completed and executed revised form of election. If any election is not properly made with respect to any shares of IXYS common stock (none of
Littelfuse, IXYS or the exchange agent being under any duty to notify any holder of any such defect), such election will be deemed to be not in effect, and the

Table of Contents

shares of IXYS common stock covered by such election will be deemed to be non-election shares, unless a proper election is thereafter timely made.

        Any holder may, at any time during the election period, revoke his, her or its election by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline or by
withdrawal prior to the election deadline of his, her or its certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the exchange agent. All
elections will be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the exchange agent of written notification from Littelfuse, IXYS and Merger Sub that the merger agreement has
been terminated.

        Subject to the form of election, Littelfuse, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, will have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the
terms of the merger agreement, governing (i) the validity of the forms of election and compliance by any holder with the election procedures described in this "—Election
Procedures" section, (ii) the method of issuance of shares of Littelfuse common stock into which shares of IXYS common stock are converted in the initial merger and (iii) the
method of payment of cash for shares of IXYS common stock converted into the right to receive the cash consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Littelfuse common
stock.

Exchange and Payment Procedures 

        Prior to the effective time, Littelfuse will enter into an exchange agent agreement with its transfer agent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to IXYS. At
or prior to the effective time, Littelfuse will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the exchange agent (i) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and all fractional
share cash amounts as is necessary for the payment to holders of IXYS common stock and (ii) evidence of Littelfuse common stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates
representing such Littelfuse common stock, at Littelfuse's election) representing the number of shares of Littelfuse common stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate stock
consideration. Such cash, book-entry shares and/or certificates, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect to such book-entry shares and/or certificates, are
referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the exchange fund.

Exchange of IXYS Share Certificates and Book-Entry IXYS Shares

        Within five business days after the effective time, the exchange agent will mail to each record holder of shares of IXYS common stock whose shares of IXYS common stock
were converted in the initial merger into the right to receive the merger consideration, and who has not previously submitted an election notice with duly executed transmittal
materials, a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering IXYS share certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon surrender of IXYS
share certificates or book-entry shares and a duly executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent in compliance with the instructions for surrender, Littelfuse will, in
exchange for such certificates or book-entry shares, cause the exchange agent to pay and deliver the merger consideration and any fractional share cash amounts.

        Littelfuse will instruct the exchange agent to pay the merger consideration and any fractional share cash amounts within five business days following the later to occur of
(i) the effective time and (ii) the exchange agent's receipt of the share certificate or book-entry share. The time that any individual stockholder receives its, his or her merger
consideration will vary depending on the underlying arrangements through which such stockholder holds its, his or her shares of IXYS common stock.

        In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of IXYS common stock that is not registered in IXYS' transfer or stock records, cash may be paid and/or shares may be
issued to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered IXYS share certificate or book-entry share is registered if such certificate or book-entry share is presented
to the exchange agent accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction

of the exchange agent and Littelfuse that any applicable stock transfer or other similar taxes have been paid.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

        In the event that an IXYS share certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the previous holder of the IXYS share certificate may obtain the merger consideration and the amount
of any owed dividends or distributions in respect of such certificate by (i) making an affidavit regarding the loss, theft or destruction of the IXYS share certificate and (ii) if
required by Littelfuse or the exchange agent, posting a bond (in a reasonable amount as determined by Littelfuse or the exchange agent) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Littelfuse or the exchange agent with respect to the lost, stolen or destroyed IXYS share certificate.

        IXYS share certificates or book-entry shares should not be surrendered by IXYS stockholders except pursuant to the instructions set forth in the election notice or in the
letter of transmittal that will be mailed to IXYS stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time. In all cases with respect to IXYS shares certificates
and book-entry shares, the merger consideration will be provided only in accordance with the procedures set forth in such letter of transmittal.

        No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any IXYS share certificates or book-entry shares.

Dividends and Distributions

        No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time with respect to Littelfuse common stock will be paid to the holder of any shares of IXYS
common stock until such holder properly surrenders its shares in accordance with the procedures described in this "—Exchange and Payment Procedures" section. After proper
surrender, Littelfuse will cause such holder to be paid, without interest, (i) the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time and paid
with respect to such shares of Littelfuse common stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the merger agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Littelfuse common stock. After the effective time, Littelfuse will cause IXYS to pay on the applicable payment date the amount of any dividends or
other distributions on shares of IXYS common stock that have a record date prior to the effective time and a payment date after the effective time.

Rights of IXYS Stockholders Following the Effective Time and Transfers Following the Effective Time

        The shares of Littelfuse common stock delivered and the cash paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement in respect of any shares of IXYS common stock
will be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of IXYS common stock (subject to any appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL). From and after the effective time, all holders of IXYS share certificates and book-entry shares will cease to have any rights as stockholders of IXYS
other than the right to receive the merger consideration upon the surrender of such shares (together with the fractional share cash amount and any dividends or other distributions
to which such shares become entitled in accordance with the merger agreement), without interest. From and after the effective time, the stock transfer books of IXYS will be
closed with respect to all shares of IXYS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. From and after the effective time, there will be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of IXYS and any certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing shares of IXYS common stock that are presented to Littelfuse or
the exchange agent for any reason will be cancelled and exchanged for the merger consideration in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (subject to any appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL).

        None of the parties to the merger agreement or the exchange agent will be liable to any person with respect to any portion of the exchange fund or the merger consideration
delivered to a public official if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Further, any portion of the merger consideration that remains undistributed
to holders of IXYS share certificates and book-entry shares immediately prior to the date on which the merger consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any governmental entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled to such claims or interest.

Withholding Rights

        IXYS, Littelfuse, Merger Sub, the surviving company and the exchange agent will each be entitled to deduct and withhold, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
the merger agreement, amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable tax law. Any amounts so deducted or
withheld and, if required by applicable law, paid to the applicable governmental entity will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

Treatment of IXYS Equity Awards 

Treatment of Stock Options

        At the effective time, each outstanding and unexercised IXYS stock option will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into a Littelfuse stock option to acquire (i) that
number of whole shares of Littelfuse common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of IXYS common stock subject
to such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (y) 0.1265, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (x) the exercise price per share of IXYS common stock of such IXYS stock option divided by (y) 0.1265. Each IXYS stock option
assumed and converted into a Littelfuse stock option will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting schedule (including any accelerated vesting terms) and all
other terms and conditions as applied to such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

        The merger agreement provides that, as soon as practicable following the date of the merger agreement, IXYS will take all actions with respect to IXYS' Amended and
Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the IXYS ESPP, that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to the offering
period in effect as of August 25, 2017, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the IXYS ESPP offering period, no employee who is not enrolled in the IXYS ESPP on
August 25, 2017 may participate in the IXYS ESPP and no participant in the IXYS ESPP who is enrolled in the IXYS ESPP on August 25, 2017 may increase the percentage
amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on August 25, 2017 for the IXYS ESPP offering period; (ii) if the IXYS ESPP offering period ends prior to the
closing date, then following the purchase of IXYS common stock pursuant to the IXYS ESPP offering period, the IXYS ESPP will be suspended and no new offering period will
be commenced under the IXYS ESPP prior to the effective time; (iii) if the IXYS ESPP offering period has not ended prior to the closing date, then any accumulated payroll
deductions under the IXYS ESPP as of the closing date will be used to purchase shares of IXYS common stock immediately prior to the effective time; and (iv) in all cases,
subject to the consummation of the merger, the IXYS ESPP will terminate, effective immediately prior to the effective time.

board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with IXYS' outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Under the merger agreement, a "company takeover proposal" means any proposal or offer from any person (other than Littelfuse and its subsidiaries) relating to, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, binding share exchange, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or
similar transaction involving IXYS, (ii) any acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding IXYS common stock or securities of IXYS representing more than 25% of the voting
power of IXYS, (iii) any acquisition (including the acquisition of stock of a subsidiary of IXYS) of assets or businesses of IXYS or its subsidiaries, including pursuant to a joint
venture, representing 25% or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of IXYS, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
person beneficially owning 25% or more of the outstanding IXYS common stock or securities of IXYS representing more than 25% of the voting power of IXYS or (v) any
combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, revenues or earnings and IXYS common stock (or voting power of
securities of IXYS other than IXYS common stock) involved is 25% or more.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, if at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the IXYS stockholders of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, IXYS
receives a written, bona fide, unsolicited company takeover proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions of the merger agreement and that the
IXYS board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a superior proposal (as defined below), IXYS and its representatives may (i) furnish information (including non-public information) with respect to IXYS to the party
making the company takeover proposal (subject to certain conditions and obligations described below) and its representatives and (ii) engage in discussions and negotiations with
the party making such company takeover proposal and its representatives.

        IXYS may furnish information with respect to IXYS to the party making the company takeover proposal, as described above, only pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as an acceptable confidentiality agreement) that contains provisions that are materially no less favorable to IXYS than
those contained in the existing confidentiality agreement between IXYS and Littelfuse (excluding standstill restrictions). Substantially concurrently with furnishing such
information, IXYS must make available to Littelfuse any non-public information concerning IXYS that is made available to such person making the company takeover proposal
or its representatives (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously furnished to Littelfuse).

        As used in the merger agreement, a "superior proposal" means a bona fide, written company takeover proposal that if consummated would result in a third party (or in the
case of a direct merger between such third party and IXYS, the stockholders of such party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding IXYS common
stock or more than 50% of the assets of IXYS and its subsidiaries (as measured by fair market value as determined in good faith by the IXYS board of directors), taken as a
whole, that the IXYS board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, taking into account such
factors as the IXYS board of directors considers in good faith to be appropriate and relevant, including the timing and likelihood of consummation relative to the merger and all
other financial, legal, regulatory, tax and other aspects of such proposal and the party making such company takeover proposal, is more favorable to IXYS stockholders than the
merger (after giving effect to any changes to the merger agreement proposed by Littelfuse in response to the company takeover proposal).

Existing Discussions or Negotiations; Required Notification of Littelfuse

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, IXYS agreed that it will, and that it will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees (and
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other representatives) to immediately cease and terminate any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations
with any person (other than Littelfuse) that was ongoing with respect to a company takeover proposal at the execution of the merger agreement. Further, IXYS agreed to, and to
cause its affiliates to, promptly request any person that executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with any actual or potential company takeover
proposal in effect on the date of the merger agreement to return or destroy all confidential information in the possession of such person and its representatives.

        IXYS agreed to promptly (and in any event within one business day) notify Littelfuse if the IXYS board of directors makes a determination that a company takeover
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, or if IXYS furnishes non-public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations
with a person making a company takeover proposal. IXYS also agreed to promptly (and in any event within one business day after its receipt) notify Littelfuse in the event that
IXYS or any of its representatives receives a company takeover proposal or a request for information relating to IXYS that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a
company takeover proposal, including the identity of the person making the company takeover proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted
copy of the company takeover proposal or, where the company takeover proposal is not in writing, a description of the financial and other material terms thereof). Further, after
giving such a notice, IXYS must keep Littelfuse reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of such company takeover proposal, inquiry or request,
promptly (and in any event within one business day) provide Littelfuse with any draft agreements relating to such company takeover proposal, and promptly (and in any event
within one business day) notify Littelfuse of any material modifications to the financial or other material terms of such company takeover proposal, inquiry or request. IXYS
agreed that it and its subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of the merger agreement that prohibits IXYS from providing any
information to Littelfuse in accordance with the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, including the provisions described above.

No Change in Recommendation or Termination For a Superior Proposal 

        Subject to certain exceptions described below, the IXYS board of directors may not make a company adverse recommendation change. The following actions constitute a
"company adverse recommendation change" under the merger agreement:

• failure to include the IXYS board of directors recommendation in favor of the merger proposal in this proxy statement/prospectus; 

• changing, qualifying, withholding, withdrawing or modifying the IXYS board of directors recommendation in favor of the merger proposal in a manner adverse to
Littelfuse (or announcement of an intention to do any of the foregoing); or 

• adopting, approving or recommending to IXYS stockholders a company takeover proposal (or announcement of an intention to do any of the foregoing).

        Further, the IXYS board of directors may not authorize, cause or permit IXYS or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent or similar agreement with respect to
any company takeover proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement as described above under "—No Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals").

Superior Proposals; Intervening Events

        However, at any time before approval by IXYS stockholders of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is obtained, the IXYS board of directors may, with respect to a
bona fide, unsolicited company takeover proposal that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation restrictions in the merger agreement, subject to the conditions
described in the next sentence, (i) make a company adverse recommendation change or (ii) cause IXYS to terminate the merger agreement (and to pay, prior to or concurrently
with such termination, a $28.5 million termination fee to Littelfuse) to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior proposal. The IXYS board of directors may take the
actions described in the preceding sentence only if it has determined in good faith, after consultation with IXYS' independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
such company takeover proposal constitutes a superior proposal.

        In addition, other than in connection with a company takeover proposal, at any time before approval by IXYS stockholders of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is
obtained, the IXYS board of directors may make a company adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event (defined below) only if IXYS has complied
with its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement and the IXYS board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with IXYS' independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the IXYS board of directors.

        Under the merger agreement, an "intervening event" is defined as any fact, change, circumstance, event, occurrence or development or combination thereof that (i) was not
known and the material consequences of which (based on facts known to members of the IXYS board of directors as of the date of the merger agreement) were not reasonably
foreseeable by the IXYS board of directors as of the date of the merger agreement and (ii) does not relate to any company takeover proposal. However, any change in the price or
trading volume of IXYS common stock or Littelfuse common stock will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event has occurred (except
that any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account).

        Prior to making any company adverse recommendation change and/or terminating the agreement for a superior proposal (as described below under "—Termination of the
Merger Agreement"), (i) IXYS must provide Littelfuse four business days' prior written notice of any intention to take such action (and must provide, as applicable, the identity
of the person making the company takeover proposal and copies of any related acquisition agreements and any financing commitments or a description specifying in reasonable
detail the intervening event); (ii) during the four business days following the delivery of such written notice, the IXYS board of directors must consider in good faith any
revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Littelfuse; and (iii) after the four business days, the IXYS board of directors must determine, after consultation with
IXYS' independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, as applicable, the superior proposal would continue to be a superior proposal even if the revisions proposed
by Littelfuse were to be accepted by IXYS and given effect, or, if in response to an intervening event, that the failure to make a company adverse recommendation change would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the IXYS board of directors.

        In the event of any change in the financial terms of or any changes in the material terms of any superior proposal, IXYS must again satisfy the notice and other requirements
set out in the preceding paragraph (except that the four business day period will instead be the longer of (i) three business days and (ii) the amount of time remaining in the initial
four business day notice period).

        Neither IXYS nor the IXYS board of directors is prohibited from (i) taking and disclosing to IXYS stockholders a position contemplated by Exchange Act Rule 14e-2(a) or
Exchange Act Rule 14d-9, making any "stop, look and listen" communication to stockholders under Exchange Act Rule 14d-9(f) or otherwise complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable law with respect to a company takeover proposal; or (ii) directing any person that makes a company takeover proposal to the non-solicitation
provisions of the merger agreement.

IXYS Stockholder Meeting 

        IXYS agreed to take all actions necessary to mail this proxy statement/prospectus to IXYS stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after this registration
statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is declared effective by the SEC and to convene a meeting of IXYS stockholders to consider the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the company stockholder meeting, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus. Except as described above with respect to a company adverse recommendation change, the IXYS board of directors will
recommend approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Additionally, IXYS will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        IXYS may postpone or adjourn the company stockholder meeting (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement/prospectus required under
applicable law is timely provided to its stockholders within a reasonable amount of time, in the good faith judgment of the IXYS board of directors (after consultation with its
outside counsel), in advance of the company stockholder meeting, (ii) if required by applicable law or a request from the SEC or its staff or (iii) if at the time the meeting is
originally scheduled, IXYS has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of IXYS common stock to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
whether or not a quorum is present. However, (A) IXYS is not permitted to postpone or adjourn the company stockholder meeting for longer than the minimum duration
reasonably necessary to remedy the circumstances requiring an adjournment or postponement, (B) no single adjournment or postponement may be for more than five business
days (except as required by federal securities laws) and (C) in the case of clause (iii) in the preceding sentence, the company stockholder meeting may not be postponed to more
than 20 business days after the initially scheduled date without Littelfuse's prior written consent.

        The parties agreed that nothing in the merger agreement, including a company adverse recommendation change, will relieve IXYS of its obligation to submit the merger
agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.

Actions with Respect to IXYS Debt 

        Prior to or at the closing, IXYS will cause all outstanding obligations under (i) the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2015, as amended, by and among
IXYS, Bank of the West, KeyBank National Association, MUFG Union Bank, N.A. and Comerica Bank (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the revolving credit
agreement) and (ii) the Loan Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2015, by and between IXYS Semiconductor GmbH and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the loan agreement) to be repaid in full, and IXYS will deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Littelfuse of such repayment and of the satisfaction,
release and discharge of all other indebtedness of IXYS and its subsidiaries, other than indebtedness owed solely among IXYS and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Access to Information 

        Subject to certain limitations, prior to the effective time, IXYS will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, afford Littelfuse and its representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to all of IXYS' and its subsidiaries' personnel, properties, contracts, books and records and make available to Littelfuse and its representatives all other
available information concerning its business, developed and in-development products, properties and personnel as Littelfuse may reasonably request.

Employee Matters 

        During the period commencing at the effective time and ending on the first anniversary of the effective time, Littelfuse will provide, or will cause its subsidiaries to provide,
each employee of IXYS or any of its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Littelfuse or any of its subsidiaries following the effective time (referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as a continuing employee) with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than that provided to such continuing employee
immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) a target quarterly and/or annual cash bonus or commission opportunity, as applicable, that is no less favorable than that provided to
such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time, and (iii) other compensation opportunities and employee benefits (including, without limitation, equity or
equity-based compensation and severance, retirement, health and welfare benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees
of Littelfuse and its subsidiaries. Littelfuse may satisfy its obligation described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence for the period commencing at the effective time and
ending on the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the effective time and (B) December 31, 2018 by providing employee benefits on terms that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such continuing employee by IXYS and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time.

        Following the closing date, Littelfuse will cause any Littelfuse benefit plans in which the continuing employees are eligible to participate following the closing date to
recognize the service of each continuing employee with IXYS and its affiliates (and their respective predecessors) prior to the closing date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual (other than benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare plans) under such Littelfuse benefit plans, in each case, to the same extent such
service was recognized immediately prior to the effective time under comparable IXYS benefit plans and subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. Further,
with respect to any Littelfuse benefit plan that provides medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which a continuing employee is
first eligible to participate, Littelfuse will waive (or cause to be waived), with respect to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the corresponding IXYS benefit plans in which
such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents participated immediately prior to the effective time and credit each continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents for an amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such continuing employee in the plan year in which such continuing employee is first
eligible to participate in such Littelfuse benefit plan for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Littelfuse benefit
plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited under comparable IXYS benefit plans in which such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents
participated immediately prior to the effective time.

        In addition, if requested by Littelfuse before the anticipated closing date, IXYS will terminate its 401(k) plan, effective as of the day immediately prior to the effective time,
and Littelfuse will permit the continuing employees who are then actively employed by Littelfuse or one of its subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of eligible rollover
distributions (excluding loans) from IXYS' 401(k) plan to Littelfuse's 401(k) plan.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        The merger agreement provides that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time in favor of
any present or former director, officer or employee of IXYS or any of its subsidiaries, and any person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of any other
entity at the request or for the benefit of IXYS or any of its subsidiaries (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the IXYS indemnified

parties) will survive the merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, as set forth in the IXYS organizational documents as in effect on the date of
the merger agreement or any indemnification agreements in existence as of, and disclosed to Littelfuse prior to, the date of the merger agreement.

        Following the effective time, the surviving company will indemnify and hold harmless each IXYS indemnified party against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of the fact that such
person was a director or officer of IXYS or any of its subsidiaries or other fiduciary in any entity at the request or for the benefit of IXYS and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring or actions taken (or omitted to be taken) prior to or at the effective time (including with respect to the merger agreement and the merger), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

        The merger agreement requires the surviving company to maintain, for a period of six years after the effective time, IXYS' existing directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies, or substantially comparable insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured.
However, the surviving company is not required to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid by
IXYS as of the date of the merger agreement for such insurance. In lieu of the foregoing, IXYS, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Littelfuse, may (and at the
request of Littelfuse, IXYS will use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain, at or prior to the effective time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy that provides equivalent coverage for the
indemnitees for an aggregate price not to exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid by IXYS as of the date of the merger agreement for such insurance.

Littelfuse Board of Directors 

        Littelfuse agreed to take all appropriate action so that, as of the effective time, its board of directors will be increased by one member, who will be Dr. Nathan Zommer (the
current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IXYS), subject to Dr. Zommer completing Littelfuse's director and officer questionnaire form, together with such supporting
documentation or other information that Littelfuse may reasonably request.

Certain Additional Covenants 

        The merger agreement contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this proxy statement/prospectus, regulatory filings and
approvals (which are described in the section titled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals"), delisting of shares of IXYS common stock from The NASDAQ Global Select
Market, deregistration of IXYS common stock under the Exchange Act, reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, notification of certain events and

antitrust laws, have been satisfied or waived or are capable of being satisfied at such time, the end date will be extended automatically to May 28, 2018. The right
to terminate the merger agreement according to this provision is not available to a party if the failure of the closing to have occurred by the end date was due to the
action or failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement. This termination right is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus
as the end date termination right;

• by either IXYS or Littelfuse, if a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has entered or issued a final and nonappealable order or adopted or enacted a law
that is final and nonappealable that permanently restrains, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the merger. However, the right to terminate the merger
agreement according to this provision is not available to a party if such order was due to the material breach by such party of any covenant or other agreement of
such party contained in the merger agreement; 

• by either IXYS or Littelfuse, if the approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement by IXYS stockholders has not been obtained after a vote on approval
of the merger proposal has been taken at the company stockholder meeting (including any postponement or adjournment thereof); 

• by either IXYS or Littelfuse, if the other party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement and
such breach (i) would result in the failure of conditions to closing and (ii) is not curable by, or is not cured by, the earlier of the end date and the date that is 30
business days following written notice describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail and of the first party's intention to terminate the merger agreement
pursuant to this termination right. However, the terminating party may not exercise this termination right if it is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement; 

• by IXYS, prior to receipt of approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement by IXYS stockholders, in order to accept a superior proposal, subject to the
prior or concurrent payment of the company termination fee (as described below); or 

• by Littelfuse, prior to receipt of approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement by IXYS stockholders, if a company adverse recommendation change
occurs or if IXYS is in material and willful breach of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement.

Company Termination Fee

        IXYS must pay Littelfuse a termination fee of $28.5 million in cash, referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the company termination fee, if the merger agreement
is terminated in the following circumstances:

• in the event the merger agreement is terminated by IXYS to accept a superior proposal; or 

• in the event the merger agreement is terminated by Littelfuse following a company adverse recommendation change or if IXYS is in willful and material breach of
its non-solicitation obligations.

        Additionally, if IXYS enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any company takeover proposal (in each case with references to 25% in the
definition of company takeover proposal being replaced by 50% for this purpose) within 12 months after a termination of the merger agreement in any of the following
circumstances, IXYS must also pay Littelfuse the company termination fee:

• if (i) Littelfuse or IXYS terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the end date termination right and at the end date all of the conditions to IXYS' obligation to
close other than receipt of

approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement by IXYS stockholders were satisfied, or were capable of satisfaction had the closing occurred on the end
date, and (ii) a company takeover proposal was publicly announced prior to the end date and not definitively withdrawn at least three business days prior to the
end date;

• if (i) Littelfuse or IXYS terminates the merger agreement due to failure to obtain the approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement by IXYS
stockholders at the company stockholder meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, at which a vote to adopt the merger agreement was taken and
(ii) a company takeover proposal was publicly announced prior to the company stockholder meeting and not definitively withdrawn at least three business days
prior to the company stockholder meeting; or 

• if (i) Littelfuse terminates the merger agreement due to IXYS' willful breach of its covenants or agreements in the merger agreement and (ii) a company takeover
proposal was publicly announced prior to the date of the breach giving rise to such termination and not definitively withdrawn at least three business days prior to
the date of the breach giving rise to such termination.

        In no event will the company termination fee be payable more than once.

Post-Termination Liability

        Generally, if the merger agreement is terminated, there will be no other liability on the part of IXYS, Littelfuse or Merger Sub except for (i) the payment of any required
termination fee by IXYS under the merger agreement and (ii) any liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or willful breach of the merger agreement occurring prior to
termination.

        Other than with respect to claims for, or arising out of or in connection with, fraud or willful breach of the merger agreement, IXYS will have no further liability of any kind
in connection with the merger agreement or the termination of the merger agreement upon payment of any required termination fee.

Amendment and Assignment 

        Any provision of the merger agreement may be amended or waived prior to the effective time only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom such waiver is to be effective, and in the case of an amendment, by IXYS, Littelfuse and Merger Sub. No amendments may be made that by
law require further approval by the IXYS stockholders without obtaining such further approval.

        Neither the merger agreement nor any rights, interest or obligations under the merger agreement may be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of the
nonassigning parties to the merger agreement, provided that, without IXYS' consent, Littelfuse or Merger Sub may assign any of their rights under the merger agreement to a
wholly owned subsidiary of Littelfuse, provided that such assignment will not relieve Littelfuse or Merger Sub of any of its obligations under the merger agreement.

Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement 

        Each of IXYS, Littelfuse and Merger Sub agreed that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the merger agreement were not performed or
were threatened to be not performed, or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that each may be entitled to, including
monetary damages, each will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the
merger agreement. Each of IXYS, Littelfuse and Merger Sub also

irrevocably waived any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such injunctions.

        Further, with respect to legal actions or proceedings relating to the merger agreement and the rights and obligations under the merger agreement, each of IXYS, Littelfuse
and Merger Sub (i) agreed such actions or proceedings will be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines jurisdiction, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (ii) submitted to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or to the extent the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines jurisdiction, any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware) and (iii) waived (A) any claim that it is not personally subject to
such jurisdiction, (B) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from such courts or from legal process commenced in such courts and (C) any claim of inconvenient
forum or improper venue.

party will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of Littelfuse common stock or any options
or warrants to purchase any Littelfuse common stock, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive Littelfuse common stock, owned
directly by such party (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which such party has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the SEC, or acquired
after the date of the voting agreement, other than pursuant to certain permitted transfers, including to immediate family or controlled affiliates.

the effective time and February 1, 2019 and (c) the entry without the express prior written consent of the parties to the agreement into any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of the merger agreement that (i) reduces the amount, or modifies the form, of the merger consideration payable to any of the stockholders of IXYS, or (ii) amends
or modifies any of the closing conditions in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the proposed transaction. Specifically, Littelfuse tables present unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information about Littelfuse's consolidated balance sheet and statements of income after giving effect to the merger with IXYS. Littelfuse
presents the pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as if the transaction had occurred on September 30, 2017. Littelfuse presents the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 as if the transaction had occurred on
January 3, 2016. This unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting where Littelfuse is considered the
acquirer of IXYS for accounting purposes. See the section titled "Accounting Treatment for the Merger" beginning on page 80.

        In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information includes adjustments which are preliminary and may be revised. There can be no assurance
that such revisions will not result in material changes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of results that actually would have occurred or that may occur in the future had the merger been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of Littelfuse after the merger. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected due to various factors,
including those discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32.

        The information presented below should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Littelfuse and IXYS, including the related notes filed
by each of them with the SEC in addition to the pro forma condensed combined financial information of Littelfuse and IXYS, including the related notes appearing elsewhere in
this proxy statement/prospectus. See the sections titled "Where You Can Find More Information" and "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information"
beginning on pages 151 and 115, respectively.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the following separate historical consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes of Littelfuse and IXYS for the applicable periods, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus:

• Littelfuse financial statements as of and for (i) the year ended December 31, 2016 in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and (ii) the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; and 

• IXYS financial statements as of and for (i) the year ended March 31, 2017 in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and (ii) the six months ended September 30, 2017

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
GIVING EFFECT TO THE TRANSACTION

1.     Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

        The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on Littelfuse's historical consolidated financial statements and IXYS' historical
financial statements as adjusted to give effect to the acquisition of IXYS by Littelfuse. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 give effect to the acquisition of IXYS as if it had occurred on January 3, 2016. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 gives effect to the acquisition of IXYS as if it occurred on September 30, 2017. IXYS fiscal year end is March 31.
In order to conform to Littelfuse's fiscal year end of December 31, IXYS financial information included above has been calculated for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
nine months ended September 30, 2017.

        Littelfuse has adjusted historical consolidated financial statements of Littelfuse and IXYS to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the
acquisition, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined
results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the combined company's financial condition or results of operations
would have been had the acquisition occurred on the dates indicated. They also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the
combined company. The actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of reasons.

        Littelfuse has prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements for the proposed acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under
existing U.S. GAAP, with Littelfuse as the acquirer in the acquisition for accounting purposes. Under the acquisition method of accounting, Littelfuse will measure the total
estimated purchase price (consideration transferred) as described in Note 3, "Estimate of Consideration Expected to be Transferred," at the Closing Date of the acquisition using
the market price of Littelfuse and number of outstanding shares of IXYS common stock and stock options at that time. Therefore, this may result in a per share equity value that
is different from that assumed for the purposes of preparing these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Littelfuse has based the underlying tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on their respective fair market values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. Littelfuse has measured the assets
and liabilities of IXYS based on various preliminary estimates and will revise them at the effective time of the acquisition as additional information becomes available and as
Littelfuse completes its valuation work.

        The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements prepared
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Once the acquisition has closed, Littelfuse will complete the purchase price allocation after performing a valuation of
IXYS' assets and liabilities at the level of detail necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition
accounting will occur and these differences could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the combined company's
future results of operations and financial position.

        Acquisition related transaction costs (e.g., investment banker, advisory, legal, valuation, and other professional fees) and certain acquisition restructuring and related charges
have not been included as a component of consideration transferred, but instead must be expensed as incurred. Littelfuse estimates total acquisition related transaction costs of
approximately $28.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Littelfuse and IXYS incurred approximately $3.0 million and $2.3 million of

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945699/000104746917007634/a2234030zdefm14a.htm 129/273

acquisition related transaction costs, respectively. Littelfuse has reduced Selling, general, and administrative expenses by the combined amount of $5.3 million for these costs in
the pro forma unaudited condensed combined statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 because these costs will not have a continuing impact on the results of
the combined company. The pro forma balance sheet reflects $23.3 million of additional anticipated acquisition related transaction costs of both companies as Accrued expenses
with a corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity. The costs that Littelfuse and IXYS may ultimately incur could differ materially from this amount.

        In order to prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Littelfuse performed a limited preliminary review of IXYS' accounting policies and
did not identify any significant differences. After the acquisition is completed, Littelfuse will conduct an additional review of IXYS' accounting policies to determine if
differences in accounting policies require further adjustment or reclassification of IXYS' results of operations, assets or liabilities to conform to Littelfuse's accounting policies
and classifications. As a result of that review, Littelfuse may identify additional differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could
have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings that Littelfuse expects to realize. Littelfuse expects to deliver at least
$30 million in annual cost savings within two years after closing of the acquisition, which Littelfuse expects to accomplish by leveraging operating and general and
administrative efficiencies. Although Littelfuse's management expects that costs savings will result from the acquisition, Littelfuse cannot assure you these cost savings will be
achieved.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also do not include any adjustment for liabilities or related costs that may result from integration
activities, since management has not completed the process of making these assessments. Significant liabilities and related costs may ultimately be recorded for employee
severance or relocation, costs of vacating some facilities and costs associated with other exit and integration activities.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also do not reflect any adjustments to IXYS accrued post-retirement benefits, long term equity
investments accounted for under the equity method and investments accounted for under the cost method, as Littelfuse lacks sufficient information to estimate the fair values as
of September 30, 2017.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also do not reflect the effects of any future tax legislation.

2.     IXYS Acquisition

        Upon completion of the acquisition, at IXYS stockholders' election and subject to proration, each share of IXYS common stock, par value $0.01 per share, owned
immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive: (i) $23.00 in cash (subject to applicable
withholding tax), without interest (referred to as the cash consideration), or (ii) 0.1265 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Littelfuse (referred to as the
stock consideration and together with the cash consideration, the merger consideration). IXYS stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Littelfuse common
stock that the IXYS stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive. Additionally, at the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of IXYS common stock
granted under an IXYS equity plan will be assumed by Littelfuse and converted into an option to acquire (i) a number of shares of Littelfuse common stock equal to the number
of shares of IXYS common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by 0.1265, rounded down to the nearest whole share, with (ii) an
exercise price per share of Littelfuse common stock equal to the exercise price of such IXYS stock option immediately prior to the effective time divided by 0.1265, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945699/000104746917007634/a2234030zdefm14a.htm 130/273

Table of Contents

        The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Littelfuse common stock fluctuates because the stock consideration is payable in a fixed
number of shares of Littelfuse common stock and will not be adjusted for changes in the market value of shares of Littelfuse or IXYS common stock. As a result, the value of the
stock consideration that IXYS stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the value of the stock consideration on the
date of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the special meeting of the IXYS stockholders described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus
(referred to as the special meeting).

        Based on the $206.40 per share closing price of Littelfuse common stock on November 24, 2017, the consideration IXYS stockholders will receive in exchange of their
IXYS common stock in the acquisition has a value of approximately $24.55 per IXYS share, or $805.3 million. In addition to the consideration transferred related to IXYS
common stock, as of November 24, 2017, the value of consideration expected to be transferred, and included in the purchase price, related to IXYS stock options that will be
converted to Littelfuse stock options has a value of approximately $43.0 million. As a result, total consideration as of November 24, 2017 is valued at approximately
$848.2 million. The market values of Littelfuse common stock and number of outstanding shares of IXYS common stock and value of stock options will continue to fluctuate
until the acquisition is completed. As a result, the consideration assumed for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements will differ, and that
difference may be material.

        Littelfuse accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired business are included in Littelfuse's consolidated financial statements from the date of
the acquisition.

3.     Estimate of Consideration Expected to be Transferred

        In estimating the fair value of the merger consideration, or purchase price, Littelfuse has assumed a price per share of Littelfuse common stock of $206.40, which represents
the per share closing price of Littelfuse common stock on November 24, 2017.

        The following is a preliminary estimate of the purchase price:

Preliminary Purchase Price

(in thousands, except per share data)    
Equivalent shares of Littelfuse common stock to be issued (a)   2,074 
Littelfuse common stock price as of November 24, 2017  $ 206.40 
Estimated stock consideration to be transferred  $ 428,074 
Cash consideration to be transferred   377,185 
Fair value of Littelfuse stock options issued in exchange for IXYS stock options (b)   42,963 
Estimate of consideration expected to be transferred  $ 848,222 

(a) Represents 32,798,725 outstanding shares of IXYS common stock as of November 24, 2017 multiplied by 0.5 and in turn multiplied by the exchange
ratio. The actual number of shares of Littelfuse common stock that Littelfuse will issue to IXYS stockholders upon closing of the acquisition will be
based on the actual number of shares of IXYS common stock outstanding when the acquisition closes, and the valuation of those shares will be based on
the trading price of Littelfuse common stock at that time.

4.     Preliminary Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Assumed

        The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition as of September 30,
2017:

        The purchase price will be computed using the value of Littelfuse common stock and number of outstanding shares of IXYS common stock and stock options on the Closing
Date. Therefore, the actual purchase price and resulting goodwill will fluctuate with the market price of Littelfuse common stock and the number of outstanding shares of IXYS
common stock and stock options until the acquisition is consummated. As a result, the final purchase price and goodwill could differ significantly from this current estimate,
which could materially impact the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

        The following table shows sensitivities to changes in purchase price and goodwill due to changes in the per share price of Littelfuse common stock. Littelfuse performed
these calculations using constant valuation inputs, which may change based on the final purchase price allocation and other variables.

5.     Pro Forma Adjustments

(b) Reflects the estimated consideration Littelfuse will transfer for the acquisition of IXYS consisting of: (i) $428.1 million in Littelfuse common stock, (ii) $43.0 million for
conversion of IXYS stock options, and (iii) $377.2 million in cash. The consideration is based on closing price of Littelfuse stock and fair value of IXYS stock options,
included in the calculation, as of November 24, 2017. The actual number of shares of Littelfuse common stock issued to IXYS stockholders upon closing of the
acquisition will be based on the actual number of shares of IXYS common stock outstanding when the transaction closes, and the fair value of those shares will be based
on the trading price of Littelfuse common stock at that time. 

(c) Reflects a $41.6 million increase in IXYS property, plant, and equipment to adjust the assets acquired to their estimated fair values. The fair value of IXYS property,
plant, and equipment was determined based on a combination of cost and sales comparison approaches. Adjustments to IXYS depreciation expense for property, plant,
and equipment were based on comparing the historical depreciation recorded during the periods presented to the revised depreciation. Littelfuse calculated incremental
depreciation expense of $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the step up in the
fair values of the acquired property, plant, and equipment by dividing, on a straight-line basis, the fair value assigned to these assets by the estimated remaining useful
lives. 

(d) Reflects the elimination IXYS' historical intangible assets and recognition of the estimated fair value of IXYS intangible assets. The following table provides a
preliminary estimate of the fair value of those intangible assets and their related average estimated useful lives:

For IXYS' finite lived intangible assets, the pro forma financial statements reflect an adjustment to increase IXYS amortization expense by $10.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2017 and $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The amortization of the backlog intangible asset is not reflected in the
unaudited condensed combined statements of income because it does not have a continuing impact. The fair value of IXYS identifiable intangible assets was estimated
primarily using the income approach which requires an estimate or forecast of all the expected future cash flows, either through the use of the relief-from-royalty method
or the multi-period excess earnings method. Littelfuse will record amortization expense assuming a straight-line basis over the expected life of the finite lived intangible
assets, which approximates expected future cash flows.

(e) Reflects the recognized goodwill, which represents the amount by which the estimated consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the IXYS assets Littelfuse
acquires and the liabilities Littelfuse assumes. Littelfuse will not amortize the goodwill, but will instead test the goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever
events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a possible impairment. 

(f) Reflects the recognition of the step-up of IXYS finished goods and work in process inventory to fair value of $33.5 million. The fair value was determined based on the
estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. After
the acquisition, the step-up in inventory will increase

the cost of sales over approximately five months as the inventory is sold. The increase is not reflected in the unaudited condensed combined statements of incomes
because it does not have a continuing impact.

(g) Littelfuse estimates the combined transaction expenses for the acquisition will be approximately $28.6 million. The costs that Littelfuse and IXYS may ultimately incur
could differ materially from this amount. Transaction expenses include fees for investment banker, advisory, legal, valuation, and other professional fees. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2017, Littelfuse and IXYS incurred approximately $3.0 million and $2.3 million of acquisition related transaction costs, respectively.
Littelfuse has reduced Selling, general, and administrative expenses by the combined amount of $5.3 million for these costs in the pro forma unaudited condensed
combined statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 because these costs will not have a continuing impact on the results of the combined
company. The pro forma balance sheet reflects $23.3 million of additional anticipated acquisition related transaction costs of both companies as Accrued expenses with a
corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity. 

(h) Reflects the use of IXYS cash to pay off outstanding IXYS long-term debt of $77.9 million. 

(i) Reflects $267.2 million of planned incremental borrowing under Littelfuse's Amended Credit Facility, net of transaction costs of approximately $1.7 million. Interest
expense has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the additional borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs, and changes to interest rates. 

(j) Littelfuse expects to incur $20.1 million of compensation expense related to the remaining service periods for IXYS stock options converted to Littelfuse stock options.
The additional costs are not included in the unaudited condensed combined statements of income because it does not have a continuing impact. 

(k) Reflects the estimated deferred taxes and income tax expense (benefit) for the adjustments shown in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
Littelfuse calculated a pro forma decrease in tax expense of $5.8 million and $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and for the year ended
December 31, 2016, respectively, using a U.S. statutory rate of 38% for adjustments reflecting additional Littelfuse interest expense and using an estimated IXYS
statutory rate of 30% for adjustments reflecting additional depreciation and amortization expense for the fair value step-up of IXYS property, plant, and equipment and
intangible assets. A deferred tax liability of $83.8 million was calculated for the fair value step-up of IXYS property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and
inventory using the estimated statutory rate of 30% for IXYS. The estimated statutory rates of 30% for the IXYS related adjustments neither reflects IXYS', Littelfuse's,
nor the combined company's effective tax rate, which includes the impact of nondeductible expenses, tax audits and other permanent items as well as other tax charges
and benefits, and does not take into account any historical or possible future tax events that may impact the combined company.

DESCRIPTION OF LITTELFUSE CAPITAL STOCK 

        The following description of the material terms of the Littelfuse capital stock is a summary only and is not a complete description of such terms. Following completion of the
merger, the rights of the holders of Littelfuse common stock will be governed by the DGCL, Littelfuse's certificate of incorporation, dated as of November 25, 1991, as amended
April 25, 1997 (referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the Littelfuse charter), and Littelfuse's amended and restated bylaws, as amended October 24, 2014 (referred to

ended December 31, 2016 and a copy the Littelfuse bylaws is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to Littelfuse's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 27,
2014, each of which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See also "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 151. Littelfuse and
IXYS urge you to read the Littelfuse charter and the Littelfuse bylaws carefully and in their entirety.

        Under the Littelfuse charter, Littelfuse's authorized capital stock consists of 34,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of

        Voting.    Each holder of Littelfuse common stock is entitled to one vote per share held for the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders of Littelfuse. Cumulative voting is prohibited.

        Dividends and Other Distributions.    Holders of Littelfuse common stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Littelfuse board of
directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor, subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding preferred stock.

        Liquidation Rights.    Subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding preferred stock, in the event of Littelfuse's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of
Littelfuse's common stock are entitled to share ratably in the net assets of Littelfuse remaining after payment of debts and other liabilities.

        Other Rights.    Littelfuse's common stock does not carry any preemptive rights enabling a holder to subscribe for, or receive shares of, any class of Littelfuse's common

Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Delaware Law and Littelfuse's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 

        The provisions of Delaware law and of the Littelfuse charter and bylaws described below, alone or in combination, could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to
transactions not approved in advance by the directors of Littelfuse, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for
shares of Littelfuse common stock. However, Littelfuse believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring

potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors of Littelfuse and by providing the board of directors of Littelfuse with more time and leverage in assessing an
acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make Littelfuse immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the acquisition proposal may be
considered beneficial by some Littelfuse stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board of directors of Littelfuse determines is not in the best interests of
Littelfuse and its stockholders.

        Delaware Law.    Littelfuse is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. This statute regulating corporate takeovers prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
business combination with any "interested stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203) for three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested
stockholder, unless:

• prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming
an interested stockholder; 

• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the
voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (but
not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) (i) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) shares owned by
employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a
tender or exchange offer; or 

• at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and
not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.

        Generally, a business combination as defined by the DGCL includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested
stockholder. An interested stockholder is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL as any person (other than the corporation and any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of
the corporation) that, together with such person's affiliates and associates, (i) owns (directly or indirectly, or otherwise has the right to acquire or the right to vote (other than a
right to vote arising solely from a revocable proxy or consent)) 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock, or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of a corporation and was
the owner (to the same extent as described in clause (i)) of 15% or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately
preceding a business combination of the corporation governed by Section 203.

        Charter and Bylaw Provisions.    The Littelfuse charter and bylaws:

• provide that special meetings of Littelfuse's stockholders may be called only by (i) the chairman of the board of directors or (ii) the board of directors pursuant to
a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors that Littelfuse would have if there were no vacancies; 

• do not provide for a minimum or maximum number of directors; 

• prohibit cumulative voting for directors; 

• provide an advance written notice procedure with respect to stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors of
Littelfuse; and 

• authorize the board of directors of Littelfuse to establish one or more series of preferred stock, the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors of
Littelfuse at the time of issuance.

stockholders who become Littelfuse stockholders will be governed by the DGCL, the Littelfuse charter and the Littelfuse bylaws. The following description summarizes the
material differences between the rights of Littelfuse stockholders and IXYS stockholders but does not purport to be a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete

significant differences do not exist. Stockholders should carefully read the relevant provisions of the Littelfuse charter, the Littelfuse bylaws, the DGCL, the IXYS charter and the

applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized,
shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with
respect to that vote on that matter.

unless the board of directors determines by resolution
that any such vacancies or newly created directorships
shall be filled by stockholders, be filled only by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in

directors. Any director elected in accordance with the
preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of
the full term of the director for which the vacancy was
created or occurred and until such director's successor

Indemnification  The Littelfuse charter provides that corporation shall, to

the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the
DGCL, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall
have power to indemnify under said section from and
against any and all of the expenses, liabilities or other
matters referred to in or covered by said section, and the
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified
may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in his or her official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, and
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
a person.

The Littelfuse bylaws provide that Littelfuse shall
indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents
to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and the
Littelfuse charter.

Littelfuse maintains insurance covering its directors and
officers against certain liabilities incurred by them in
their capacities as such.

 The IXYS bylaws provide that IXYS shall indemnify its
directors to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL or any other applicable law; provided, however,
that IXYS may modify the extent of such
indemnification by individual contracts with its
directors; and, provided, further, that IXYS shall not be
required to indemnify any director in connection with
any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person
unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to
be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by
the IXYS board of directors, (iii) such indemnification is
provided by IXYS, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in IXYS under the DGCL or any other
applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required to
be made under the IXYS bylaws.

IXYS has also entered into indemnity agreements with
its directors and executive officers, each of which
creates a direct contractual obligation of IXYS to
indemnify the individual under certain circumstances.
Each agreement generally provides that IXYS will
indemnify such individual to the fullest extent permitted
by law for claims arising in connection with the fact that
such person is or was a director, officer, employee, agent
or fiduciary of IXYS, or is or was serving at the request
of IXYS as a director, officer, employee, or other agent
of another corporation or enterprise. Each agreement,
among other things, sets forth the terms and conditions
on which such individual is entitled to indemnification
and contains deadlines and procedures to be followed in
connection with a request for indemnification and/or
advancement of expenses, including in the event of a
change of control of IXYS.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF IXYS STOCKHOLDERS 

        General.    If you hold one or more shares of IXYS common stock, you are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law and have the right to have your shares appraised
by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive the "fair value" of such shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger)
as of completion of the merger in place of the merger consideration, as determined by the court, if you strictly comply with the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any such IXYS stockholder awarded "fair value" for its, his or her shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of
the right to receive the merger consideration.

        The following discussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the
DGCL that is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a "stockholder" are to the record holder
of the shares of IXYS common stock. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your
rights to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger is submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders as in the case of approval of the merger proposal, IXYS, not less than
20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each stockholder who was an IXYS stockholder on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
rights are available, that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required
notice, and the copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D. A holder of IXYS common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so should review the following discussion and Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures of Section 262 of
the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration.

        How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights.    IXYS stockholders wishing to exercise the rights to seek an appraisal of their shares must do ALL of the following:

• you must not vote in favor of approval of the merger proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions
will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of approval of the merger proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must instruct the
proxy to vote your shares against approval of the merger proposal or abstain from voting your shares on the approval of the merger proposal; 

• you must deliver to IXYS a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the approval of the merger proposal at the special meeting; 

• you must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger; and 

• you or the surviving company (or any other stockholder that has properly demanded appraisal rights and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights) must file a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time of the merger. The
surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the
obligation of the IXYS stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of IXYS common stock within the time
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Table of Contents

        Voting, in person or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the approval of the merger proposal will not constitute a written demand for appraisal
as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote.

        Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights.    A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and
correctly, the stockholder's name as it appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform IXYS of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock. Non-record owners may not directly make appraisal demands to IXYS. The non-record
owner must, in such cases, have the owner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of
common stock. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of IXYS common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise appraisal
rights with respect to the shares of IXYS common stock held for one or more non-record owners, while not exercising this right for other non-record owners. In that case, the
written demand should state the number of shares of IXYS common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of IXYS common stock is expressly
mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of IXYS common stock held in the name of the record owner.

        IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE
SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,
BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A
TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

        If you own shares of IXYS common stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or
for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record;
however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in making the demand, such person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold
shares of IXYS common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such
shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.

        If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand, executed as set forth above, to:

10 days after the effective time to each stockholder that did not vote in favor of the merger agreement and delivered a written demand for appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder that did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a

proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such demand and to accept the merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement for his, her or its
shares of IXYS common stock. Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not later, any stockholder that has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL, or the surviving company may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving company
in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the value of the shares of IXYS common stock held by all such stockholders. The surviving
company is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised and have otherwise complied with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Within 120 days after the effective time, any stockholder that has complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving
company, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the approval of the merger proposal and with respect to which
IXYS has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The surviving company must mail this statement within the later of 10 days of
receipt by the surviving company of the request therefor or 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the non-record owner of shares
of stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf, you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving company the statement
described in this paragraph.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving company, the surviving company will then be obligated, within 20 days after
receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Register in Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders
demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings
and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Where proceedings are not dismissed or the
demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of IXYS common stock owned by such stockholders in
accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter
determine the fair value of the shares of IXYS common stock at the effective time held by all stockholders who have properly perfected appraisal rights, exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. When the value is determined,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by such
stockholders of their stock certificates or, in the case of book-entry shares, forthwith.

        In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court
discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant
factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset

value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme
Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of
the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered." An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of your shares as
determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration. Littelfuse and the surviving company do not
anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes
of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of IXYS common stock is less than the merger consideration.

        If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective time, then all stockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the merger
consideration described in the merger agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.

        The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs against the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
to be equitable under the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys and expert witness fees. Each stockholder is responsible for its own attorneys and expert
witnesses expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled
to appraisal.

        Any stockholder that has duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective time, be entitled to vote the IXYS shares
subject to that demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of
IXYS shares as of a record date prior to the effective time.

        Any stockholder that has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger
consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal to the surviving company, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the
effective time will require written approval of the surviving company. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, provided, however, that
this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the merger within 60 days after the effective time. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw or lose the
appraisal right, your shares will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.

        Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to
receive the merger consideration for your shares in accordance with the merger agreement. In view of the complexity of

IXYS 2018 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, IXYS will be merged with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two continuing as the surviving
company, and, consequently, there will be no annual meeting of IXYS stockholders in 2018 or thereafter. If the merger agreement is not adopted or the merger is not completed
for any reason, IXYS will hold an annual meeting of its stockholders in 2018.

        To be considered for possible inclusion in next year's proxy materials delivered on behalf of the IXYS board of directors, proposals must be submitted in writing by
March 31, 2018 to IXYS Corporate Secretary, Uzi Sasson, at 1590 Buckeye Drive, Milpitas, California 95035. Stockholders who wish submit a proposal that is not intended to
be included in next year's proxy materials delivered on behalf of the board of directors or who wish to nominate a director must do so no earlier than May 3, 2018 and no later
than June 2, 2018. Stockholders are also advised to review IXYS' bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director
nominations.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. As permitted by the
Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to stockholders residing at the same address, unless stockholders have notified their broker of
their desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience
for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

        Two or more stockholders sharing an address can request delivery of a single copy of IXYS' annual disclosure documents and this proxy statement/prospectus if they are
receiving multiple copies by contacting their broker. In the same way, two or more stockholders sharing an address and receiving only a single copy of IXYS' annual disclosure
documents and this proxy statement/prospectus can request to each receive a separate copy of the disclosure documents.

        This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of August 25, 2017, is by and among IXYS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Littelfuse, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Iron Merger Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

WITNESSETH: 

        WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Initial Merger"), with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, followed by the merger of the Company with and into Parent (the "Follow-
On Merger", and collectively with the Initial Merger, the "Mergers"), with Parent continuing as the surviving corporation in the Follow-On Merger;

        WHEREAS, in connection with the Mergers, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock" or
"Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL");

        WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Mergers are advisable and in the best interests
of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder;

        WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
stockholders of the Company are entering into voting agreements pursuant to which each such stockholder is agreeing, among other things, on the terms and subject to the
conditions of such voting agreement, to vote his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the approval of the Mergers and to take certain other actions in
furtherance thereof;

        WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Mergers, taken together, will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and that this Agreement be, and hereby is, adopted as, a "plan of

reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder; and

        WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also prescribe various conditions
to the Mergers.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

THE MERGERS

        Section 1.1    The Mergers.     

        (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the Company surviving the Initial

Agreement and as specified in the DGCL.

        (b)   Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, immediately
following the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Parent, whereupon the separate existence of the Company will cease, with Parent surviving the

shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL.

        Section 1.2    Closing.     The closing of the Mergers (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New

be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by action taken at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or (to the extent permitted) waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Closing Date occur prior to January 2, 2018 without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is

        Section 1.3    Effective Time.     

        (a)   On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Initial Merger (the "Initial Certificate of Merger") to be duly executed and

as the Initial Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary or on such other date and time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified
in the Initial Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

        (b)   Immediately following the Effective Time, the Parties shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Follow-On Merger (the "Follow-On Certificate of
Merger") to be duly executed

and filed with the Delaware Secretary as provided under the DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the Company or Parent

(such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Follow-On Merger Effective Time").

        Section 1.4    Effects of the Mergers.     

        (a)   The effects of the Initial Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company, all as provided under the

        (b)   The effects of the Follow-On Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Follow-On Merger Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Parent shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Parent shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL.

        Section 1.5    Organizational Documents.     At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company, until the effective time of the Follow-On Merger. At the Follow-On Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving

ARTICLE II.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

        Section 2.1    Effect on Capital Stock.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock or any shares of Merger Sub common stock:

        (i)    Conversion of Company Common Stock.    At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.1(d) and Section 2.2(a), and less any applicable withholding Tax, each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest:

        (A)  for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (a "Cash Election") has been effectively made and
not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (collectively, the "Cash Election Shares"), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash
Consideration (the "Cash Consideration");

        (B)  for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive Parent Common Stock (a "Stock Election") has been
effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (collectively, the "Stock Election Shares"), a number of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration"); and

        (C)  for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash Election or Stock Election has been effectively made and not
revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (collectively, the "Non-Election Shares"), the right to receive such Stock Consideration or Cash
Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 2.2(a).

        For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

        "Exchange Ratio" means 0.1265.

        "Merger Consideration" means the Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration described in Section 2.1(a)(i), as applicable.

        "Per Share Cash Consideration" means $23.00.

        From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock (including all uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry
form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate"))
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.1(d), the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and dividends pursuant to Section 2.2(g), if any) upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2, together with the
amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.2(g).

        (ii)    Cancellation of Company Common Stock.    Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by
Parent or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding

9/19/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945699/000104746917007634/a2234030zdefm14a.htm

and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the "Cancelled Shares"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

        (iii)    Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock.    Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger.

        (b)    Shares of Dissenting Stockholders.    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL ("DGCL 262" and any such shares meeting the requirement of this sentence, "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it
being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent
afforded by DGCL 262); provided, however, that if any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair market value of
such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration. "Proposed Dissenting Shares" means shares of Company Common
Stock whose holders provide demands for fair market value to the Company prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and do not vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, in each case in accordance with DGCL 262. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for fair
market value of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to DGCL 262 and any alleged dissenter's rights, and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parent's expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        (c)    Certain Adjustments.    If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided that nothing in this Section 2.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

        (d)    No Fractional Shares.    No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Mergers, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of fractional shares,

each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the Initial Merger a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon
surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Closing Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the "Fractional Share Cash Amount"). No such
holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable
as part of the Merger Consideration.

        Section 2.2    Exchange of Shares.     

        (a)    Proration.    

          (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be entitled to receive the
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares) (the "Maximum Cash Share Number").

         (ii)  Promptly (and in any event no later than five Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

        (A)  If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the "Cash Election Number") exceeds the Maximum Cash
Share Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash
Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Maximum Cash Share Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with
Section 2.2(a)(i), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

        (B)  If the Cash Election Number is less than the Maximum Cash Share Number (the amount by which the Maximum Cash Share Number exceeds
the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

(1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election
Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which

is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with Section 2.2(a)(i), whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

(2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect
of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder
by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the
denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.2(a)(i),
whether fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

        (b)    Election Procedures.    Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with, and subject to, Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.2(a) (a "Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an
election in accordance with the following procedures:

          (i)  Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2(b) (herein called an "Election") (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

         (ii)  Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as prepared
by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Form of Election"), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an Election.

        (iii)  Parent (A) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election not less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline to
Holders of record as of the Business Day prior to such mailing date, and (B) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as
promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The time period between such
mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as the "Election Period".

        (iv)  Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and executed (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Certificates representing all
certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in such Form of
Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States. As used herein, unless
otherwise agreed in advance by the Parties, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is
located) on the date which the Parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two Business Days preceding the Closing Date. The Company and Parent shall

each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than 15 Business Days before, and at least five Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline.

         (v)  Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke his, her or its Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and executed revised Form of Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock (none of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election shall
be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election
Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

        (vi)  Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his, her or its Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, previously
deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the
Parties that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

       (vii)  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right to
make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Holder
with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the method of issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted in the Mergers and (C) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

        (c)    Appointment of Exchange Agent.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Parent's transfer agent as exchange agent or another bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in the Mergers and shall enter into
an agreement (the "Exchange Agent Agreement") relating to the Exchange Agent's responsibilities under this Agreement.

        (d)    Deposit of Merger Consideration.    At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to
pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in the Mergers and the Fractional Share Cash Amount (to the extent determinable) as is necessary for the payment to
holders of Company Common Stock and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form
(and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parent's election) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the
aggregate Stock Consideration payable in the Mergers to holders of Company Common Stock (such cash, book-entry shares and certificates, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event that the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of
all Cash Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amounts (including as a result of any investment of the Exchange Fund), Parent shall promptly deposit additional funds
with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and
the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Cash Consideration and Fractional Share Amounts in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall invest any

cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon
demand.

        (e)    Exchange Procedures.    As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within five Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(i) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(g).

        (f)    Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.    Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, or any similar information from the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, such holder shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in
accordance with Section 2.2(g). Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to pay such Merger Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amount within five Business Days
following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. Any dividends or other distributions to which
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(g) shall become payable in accordance with Section 2.2(g). In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and Parent that any applicable stock transfer
or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
become entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(g).

        (g)    Treatment of Unexchanged Shares.    No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
(i) until such holder shall surrender such share in

accordance with this Section 2.2. After the surrender in accordance with this Section 2.2 of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), Parent shall cause the holder thereof to be paid, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to pay on the
applicable payment date the amount of dividends or other distributions on shares of Company Common Stock that have a record date prior to the Effective Time and a
payment date after the Effective Time, such payment to be made to the holders of Company Common Stock on such record date.

        (h)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.    The shares of Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock (subject to DGCL 262). From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2(f) (together with the
Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with
Section 2.2(g)), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

        (i)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
Parent's demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II without any interest thereon.

        (j)    No Liability.    None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund or
the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article II that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

        (k)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 2.2(i), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 2.3    Company Stock Options.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted by the Company under a Company Equity Plan (a "Company Stock

to acquire (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such

into a Parent Stock Option pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting schedule (including any accelerated vesting
terms) and all other terms and conditions as applied to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (c)   At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under the Company Equity Plans, and the number and kind of shares available

Equity Plan.

        (d)   As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter), if and to the extent necessary to cause a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be registered and issuable under Parent Stock Options, Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to the
Form S-4 and/or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Parent
Stock Options. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 and/or registration
statement on Form S-8 (as applicable) for so long as such Parent Stock Options remain outstanding.

        Section 2.4    Company ESPP.     As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are
necessary to provide that: (a) with respect to the offering period in effect as of the date hereof (the "Company ESPP Offering Period"), no employee who is not enrolled in the

new offering period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time; (c) if the Company ESPP Offering Period has not ended prior to the Closing Date,
then any accumulated payroll deductions under the Company ESPP as of the Closing Date shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (d) in all cases, subject to the consummation of the Mergers, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        Section 2.5    Further Assurances.     If at any time before or after the Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments,
deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Mergers or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the
Effective Time, including as necessary or desirable to secure and perfect full title in the Surviving Corporation to all Company Owned Intellectual Property, then Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors or managers shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments

any applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted or withheld, and, if required by applicable Law, paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

procedures are reasonably designed to ensure, that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications

applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Mergers, except where the failure to obtain such consents, orders, licenses, approvals,
authorizations or permits of, or to make such filings, declarations, registrations with or notifications to, any Governmental Entity, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of the Mergers.

        (d)   The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does not, and (assuming the Parent Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the

        (d)   Since March 30, 2014, (i) none of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director or officer of Parent has received or otherwise

information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent's
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent's system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and Parent's
independent registered accountant has issued an attestation report concluding that Parent maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,

deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so

Subsidiaries has (i) received any written notice or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral notice from any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible failure to
comply with any Law in any material respect or (ii) provided any notice to any Governmental Entity regarding any material violation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
of any Law.

        (b)   Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals,

encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent) that is ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) not to, directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any other person any information in connection with or for the purpose of soliciting, initiating, encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than,
solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this Section 5.4, and provided, that the Company and its Representatives may make inquiries
of a person making an unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) to ascertain facts regarding such Company Takeover Proposal for the sole
purpose of the Company Board of Directors informing itself about such Company Takeover Proposal and the person making it, but in each case limiting its
communication exclusively to such referral and such ascertaining of facts), or (C) approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or
enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its controlled affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its controlled affiliates is a party;
provided that, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, the Company may waive any such standstill provision applicable to any such persons
solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board of Directors.

        (b)   The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly request any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection
with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy all confidential information in the
possession of such person or its Representatives.

        (c)   Anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a) notwithstanding, if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that
did not result from a breach by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives of this Section 5.4 and if the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives; provided that the Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide or make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made

available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided or made available to Parent and (ii) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify Parent if the Company Board of Directors makes a determination that a
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal or if the Company furnishes non-public information
and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this Section 5.4(c).

        (d)   Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than one Business Day after its receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event
that the Company or any of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of such Company Takeover Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in writing, a
description of the financial and other material terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of
(including any material developments related thereto) such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request, shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day)
provide Parent with any draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover Proposal and shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify Parent of
any material modifications to the financial or other material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to
Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 5.4.

        (e)   Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4(e), the Company Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to the Company's stockholders, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or announce an
intention to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in either case, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (C) adopt, approve or
recommend to stockholders of the Company, or publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, a Company
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.4(c)) (a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
notwithstanding, prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of Directors may, with respect to a bona fide,
unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material breach by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives of this Section 5.4, make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(g) (including paying the Company
Termination Fee) in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking either such action the Company
Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement in accordance with

Section 7.1(g), (A) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and has provided to Parent the
identity of the person making such Company Takeover Proposal, a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements constituting such Company Takeover
Proposal, and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the material terms
thereof), (B) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be accepted by the Company and given
effect, and (C) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other change to the
material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four Business Day notice period referred to in
clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead end at the later of (1) 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the third Business Day immediately following Parent's receipt of such
notice and (2) the end of the original notice period; during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of clauses (B) and (C) above of
this proviso. The actions of the Company Board of Directors in making a determination that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and
the Company's authorizing and providing the notices to Parent required by this Section 5.4(e) , if done in accordance with this Section 5.4(e), shall not in and of itself,
constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, a violation of this Section 5.4 or a termination of this Agreement. Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

        (f)    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company may, at any time prior
to, but not after, the date the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company
Intervening Event if the Company has complied with its obligations under this Section 5.4 and prior to taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law; provided, however, that prior to making such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying
the reasons therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail the applicable Company Intervening Event and (ii) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after
consultation with the Company's independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law; provided, that the actions of the Company
Board of Directors in making such determination and the Company's authorizing and providing of such notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(f) shall not, if done in
accordance with Section 5.4(f), in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, a violation of this Section 5.4 or a termination of this
Agreement.

        (g)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position

contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or otherwise complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with regard to a Company Takeover Proposal; or (ii) directing any person (or the representative of that person) that makes a Company Takeover Proposal
to the provisions of this Section 5.4; provided that in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) no such action, position or disclosure that would amount to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with Section 5.4(e).

        (h)   Any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 5.4 by any of the Company's Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4 by the
Company.

        Section 5.5    Employee Matters.     

        (a)   During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Continuing Employees") for so long as such Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent during such period, (i) a base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, that is no less than that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) a target quarterly and/or annual cash bonus or
commission opportunity, as applicable, that is no less favorable than that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other
compensation opportunities and employee benefits (including, without limitation, equity or equity-based compensation and severance, retirement, health and welfare
benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided that Parent may satisfy its
obligation under this Section 5.5(a)(iii) for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the Effective Time and
(B) December 31, 2018 (the earlier such date, the "Benefit Plan Transition Date") by providing employee benefits on terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   Following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause any Parent Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
Date to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company and its Affiliates (and their respective predecessors) prior to the Closing Date for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare plans) under such Parent Benefit Plans, in each
case, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under comparable Company Benefit Plans; provided that such recognition of
service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (ii) apply for purposes of any Parent Benefit
Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that provides medical, dental, hospital,
pharmaceutical or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall (A) cause any preexisting
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the corresponding Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for an amount equal to any medical,
dental or vision expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee in the plan year in which such

Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate in such Parent Benefit Plan, for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements
under any such Parent Benefit Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited under comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (c)   If requested by Parent in writing not less than fifteen Business Days before the anticipated Closing Date, the Company Board of Directors (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such other action as is necessary to terminate any Company Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (collectively, the "Company 401(k) Plan"), effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event
such request is made and the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, then following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS regarding the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants and Parent shall permit
the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) (excluding loans) distributed to such Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to Parent's 401(k) plan.

        (d)   Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Continuing Employee or other service provider at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of
this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other compensation or employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
Parent Benefit Plan or any other compensation or employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of
Section 8.13, nothing in this Section 5.5 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any person other than the Parties, including any Continuing Employee or current
or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

        Section 5.6    Regulatory Approvals; Efforts.     

        (a)   Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers, including
(i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Mergers, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating
the Mergers, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order, waiting period
expiration or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information and
documentary material required under the HSR Act and the clearances and approvals set forth in Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers or the taking of any action contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best

efforts to not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any
permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing.

        (b)   Parent and the Company shall jointly devise and implement the strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any
filing, notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of information, application or similar filing subject to this Section 5.6. Parent and the Company shall each keep
the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Mergers and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, Orders, waiting period expirations or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5.6. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary
information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Parties (or their counsel)
copies of) all notices, submissions, or filings made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers. Each Party to this Agreement shall (A) promptly inform the other Parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Parties orally of) any communication from
or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Mergers, (B) permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any such Governmental Entity, and (C) to the extent permitted by any applicable Governmental Entity, give
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with such Governmental Entity regarding the Mergers. If any Party to this
Agreement or any Representative of such Parties receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Mergers, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Parties to this Agreement in good
faith, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such request. Each Party shall furnish the other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Mergers, and
furnish the other Parties with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity; provided, however, that Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.6 as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel. Anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6 notwithstanding, materials provided pursuant to this Section 5.6 may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company and the Mergers and other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

        (c)   The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 15 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR Act. In the event that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR
Act (a "Second Request"), the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both
Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such

Second Request review process. The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be required under any other Antitrust Law.

        Section 5.7    Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Company Stockholders Meeting.     

        (a)   As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form, and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in the Mergers, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that
the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as
necessary to complete the Mergers. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other
and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party on any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from
the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the
Form S-4. The foregoing notwithstanding, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response), except to
the extent such disclosures relate to a Company Takeover Proposal. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness
of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated. Parent shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky"
Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

        (b)   If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of

a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this Section 5.7(b) shall limit the obligations of any Party under Section 5.7(a).
For purposes of this Section 5.7, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been
provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

        (c)   The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, all action necessary to mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the Company's stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and to convene a meeting
of the Company's stockholders to consider the proposal to adopt this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including setting an appropriate record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting). The Company shall, through the
Company Board of Directors, make the Company Recommendation, include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except, in each case, during such time as a valid Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in
effect, and shall not submit any other proposal (other than, if the Company Stockholder Meeting is also the Company's annual stockholder meeting, proposals customarily
brought in connection with the Company's annual stockholder meeting) to such holders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent. The foregoing provisions of this Section 5.7(c) notwithstanding, the Company shall have the right, without the prior consent of Parent, to make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus required under applicable Law is timely provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board of Directors (after consultation with its outside counsel), in advance of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) if required by applicable
Law or a request from the SEC or its staff or (C) if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present; provided that
(1) the duration of any such adjournment or postponement shall be limited to the minimum duration reasonably necessary to remedy the circumstances giving rise to such
adjournment or postponement; (2) no single such adjournment or postponement shall be for more than five Business Days except as may be required by federal securities

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, to grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 5.9    Public Announcements.     The Parties shall consult with one another prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not issue any such public announcement or statement prior

consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto); provided that, (i) each of the Company and Parent may make press releases or public

any review or comment to Parent regarding any statement, release or disclosure in response to or in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Takeover Proposal,
its consideration of making or its making of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any matters related thereto, and following any public statement, release or
disclosure by the Company in respect of any of the foregoing matters, Parent shall not be required to provide any review or comment to the Company regarding any statement,
release or disclosure made by Parent with respect to such matters. The Company and Parent agree to issue the previously agreed upon form of joint press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement promptly following the execution of this Agreement.

        Section 5.10    Indemnification and Insurance.     

        (a)   Parent shall ensure that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and related
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of any present and former director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their respective heirs,
executors and administrators, the "Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational
Documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement or any indemnification agreements in existence as of, and disclosed to Parent prior to, the date hereof, shall survive
the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The foregoing notwithstanding, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Company Indemnified Party with respect to matters subject to indemnification
hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities and advancement of expenses
referenced in the preceding sentence shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation.

        (b)   From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each Company Indemnified Party against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or Liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of the fact that such person was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other fiduciary in any entity, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the Company and pertaining to
matters existing or occurring or actions or omissions taken prior to or at the Effective Time, including with respect to this Agreement and the Mergers, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; provided that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.10 or
otherwise.

        (c)   For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events, or actions
or omissions, which occurred or are alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to
the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding
sentence; provided that if the total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy with the
maximum coverage available for a total cost of the Premium Cap. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

        (d)   In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

        (e)   The rights of each Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Company
Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or under applicable Law. The
provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and representatives.

        Section 5.11    Control of Operations.     Without in any way limiting any Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that (a) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party's

Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Mergers by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

        Section 5.13    Actions with Respect to Certain Company Debt.     At least two Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver an executed payoff letter with
respect to the Revolving Credit Agreement and an executed payoff letter with respect to the Loan Agreement, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. The Company shall provide a draft of each such payoff letter to Parent no less than four Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. Each such payoff letter shall
(a) confirm the full outstanding amount then outstanding, along with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries accrued
under the Revolving Credit Agreement or the Loan Agreement, as applicable, (b) contain payment instructions and (c) evidence the satisfaction, release and discharge of the debt
and liabilities under the Revolving Credit Agreement or the Loan Agreement, as applicable, and the agreement by the lenders thereunder (or their agent) to release all liens upon
the payment of such amount in accordance with the payment instructions. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have obtained documents, including
an authorization to file UCC termination statements upon such payment, executed terminations and releases of any outstanding mortgages, as are reasonably necessary to release
such liens. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall cause all outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Loan Agreement to be repaid in full, and
the Company shall deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of such repayment and of the satisfaction, release and discharge of all other Indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed solely among the Company and/or its wholly owned Subsidiaries.

        Section 5.14    Transaction Litigation.     Subject to execution of a customary joint defense agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity, at Parent's expense, to
participate in the Company's defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement and/or
the Mergers. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or its
directors, executive officers or similar persons by any stockholder of the Company relating to this Agreement and/or the Mergers without the prior written consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

        Section 5.15    Nasdaq Matters.     

        (a)   Parent shall file a notification of listing of additional shares (or such other form as may be required) with the Nasdaq with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Initial Merger and such other shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Initial Merger, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Initial Merger and such other shares of Parent Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance in connection with the Initial Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   Parent and the Company agree to cooperate in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and
terminate its registration

Effective Time.

        Section 5.16    Additional Agreements.     In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement

other action as may be necessary in connection therewith.

        Section 5.17    Certain Tax Matters.     Each Party shall not (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to) take or fail to take any action which action (or failure to act)
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts and will cooperate with one another to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.3(c).
In connection therewith, (a) Parent shall deliver to each such counsel a duly executed certificate containing such customary representations, warranties and covenants as shall be

that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Mergers or (b) upon receiving any written communication from any Governmental Entity or third
party whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the Mergers that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent or
approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or approval will be materially delayed.

and renewal fees, and corresponding due dates, with respect to any Company Owned Intellectual Property needed to be taken, met or paid during the 120 day period following
the Closing in order to prosecute or maintain such Company Owned Intellectual Property.

subject to such individual completing Parent's director and officer questionnaire form, together with such supporting documentation or other information that Parent may
reasonably request.

        Section 5.23    Change of Method.     Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the Mergers, including by causing the Follow-On Merger to be a merger of the
Company with and into a wholly owned disregarded limited liability company subsidiary of Parent, if and to the extent requested by Parent, and Company agrees to enter into
such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall
(i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect to the
Company's stockholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or cause any condition of the Closing to fail to be met.

abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (except as otherwise provided below, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval), as follows:

        (a)   by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

        (b)   by either the Company or Parent, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 28, 2018 (the "Initial End
Date"); provided, however, that if on the Initial End Date all of the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(c) or Section 6.1(d) as it relates
to an Antitrust Law, shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions shall be

consummation of the Mergers; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to a Party if such Order (or
such Order becoming final and nonappealable) was due to the material breach by such Party of any covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth in this Agreement;

        (d)   by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case at which a vote on such approval was taken;

        (e)   by the Company (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
(i) Parent or Merger Sub has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
conditions in Article VI not being satisfied and (ii) which breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date

has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the conditions in Article VI not being
satisfied; and (ii) which breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is 30 Business

pursuant to this Section 7.1(f);

        (g)   by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in accordance with Section 5.4 in order to accept a Company Superior Proposal,
subject to the prior or concurrent payment of the Company Termination Fee to Parent; or

        (h)   by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, at any time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or if the Company shall
be in Willful Breach of Section 5.4.

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties in accordance with Section 8.7,
specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected.

        Section 7.2    Effect of Termination.     In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall terminate (except that the Confidentiality
Agreement and the provisions of this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII shall survive any termination), and there shall be no other Liability on the part of the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to the other except (i) as provided in Section 7.3 or (ii) Liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or any Willful
Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination (in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in
equity).

        Section 7.3    Company Termination Fee.     

        (a)   If (i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (and at the End Date all of the conditions to the Company's obligations to
close other than receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval have been satisfied, or are capable of satisfaction had the Closing occurred on the End Date),
Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.1(f) (arising from a Willful Breach of the Company's covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement), (ii) a Company Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly announced or publicly disclosed after the date of this Agreement and prior to (A) the End Date (in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)), (B) the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)) or (C) the date of the breach giving rise to such
termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (arising from a Willful Breach of the Company's covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement)),
and was not definitively withdrawn at least three Business Days prior to (X) the End Date (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)), (Y) the Company
Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)) or (Z) the date of the breach giving rise to such termination (in the case of a termination

date that is 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a
transaction included within the definition of a Company Takeover Proposal with any Person (a "Company Takeover Transaction"), the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, upon the earlier of entering into such
definitive agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Transaction and the consummation of any Company Takeover

Transaction; provided that for the purposes of clause (iii) only, all references in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal to "25%" shall be deemed to be references
to "50%."

        (b)   If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire
transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, within three Business Days after such termination.

        (c)   If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g), the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee
immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination.

        (d)   "Company Termination Fee" shall mean $28,500,000, in cash.    Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, if the Company Termination Fee
shall become due and payable in accordance with this Section 7.3, from and after such termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee in full pursuant to and
in accordance with this Section 7.3, the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives (in the case of a payment of the Company Termination Fee by the Company) shall
have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under this
Section 7.3, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is due and
payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
which such Company Termination Fee is payable. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with Section 8.5 and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under this Section 7.3, under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub be permitted
or entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee (if entitled under this Section 7.3) if the Mergers are consummated.

        (e)   The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Mergers, and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, then (i) the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount,
including in connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced, and (ii) the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

ARTICLE VIII.

Effective Time.

(by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document
format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical

        Section 8.4    Governing Law.     This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of

jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

        Section 8.5    Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement.     The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other

enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and all such
rights and remedies at law or in equity shall be cumulative, except as may be limited by Section 7.3. The Parties further agree that no Party to this Agreement shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5 and each Party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In addition, each of the
Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by another Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or the Mergers in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
above named courts, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient

recipient thereof if received prior to 5 p.m. in the place of receipt and such day is a Business Day in the place of receipt. Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication
shall be deemed not to have been received until the next succeeding Business Day in the place of receipt. Any Party may notify any other Party of any changes to the address or
any of the other details specified in this paragraph; provided, however, that such notification shall be effective only on the date specified in such notice or five Business Days

hereunder. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 8.8, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 8.8 shall be null and void.

        Section 8.9    Severability.     Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

        Section 8.10    Entire Agreement.     This Agreement together with the exhibits and schedules hereto, Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between or among the Parties,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this Agreement is not intended to grant standing to any person other than the Parties.

amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom such waiver is to be effective, and in the case of an amendment, by the
Company, Parent, and Merger Sub, provided that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment to this Agreement shall be made that by Law requires
further approval by the Company's stockholders without obtaining such further approval. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, either the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent permissible by applicable Law and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of an extension by the Company, or of the Company, in the case of an extension by Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant

any such Party contained herein. The foregoing notwithstanding, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(in the case of the Company's representations, warranties, covenants and agreements), in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and (b) except for (i) after
the Effective Time, the right of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration, which shall be enforceable by such holders and (ii) the provisions of

AMENDMENT NO. 1 

TO 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

        This AMENDMENT NO. 1 (this "Amendment"), dated as of December 4, 2017, to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of August 25,
2017, by and among IXYS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Littelfuse, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Iron Merger Co., Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), is entered into by and among the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and IXYS Merger Co., LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub Two"). All capitalized terms used in this Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Merger Agreement unless otherwise defined in this Amendment.

        WHEREAS, the Parties previously entered into the Merger Agreement, which provides for, among other things, subject to the terms and conditions therein, a business
combination by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger, followed by the merger
of the Company with and into Parent, with Parent continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger;

        WHEREAS, Section 5.23 of the Merger Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the Mergers,
including by causing the Follow-On Merger to be a merger of the Company with and into a wholly owned disregarded limited liability company subsidiary of Parent, if and to the
extent requested by Parent, and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to the Merger Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such
restructuring;

        WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5.23 of the Merger Agreement, Parent has requested that the method of effecting the Mergers be changed such that the Follow-On Merger
shall be a merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub Two (a wholly owned disregarded limited liability company subsidiary of Parent), with Merger Sub Two surviving
the Follow-On Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; and

        WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, in accordance with Section 8.11 of the Merger Agreement, to effect such change to the
method of effecting the Mergers.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Amendment and in the Merger Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

        1.    Amendments.     

        (a)   The text of the first recital of the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with the following text:

        WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Initial Merger"), with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, followed by the merger of the Company with and into
IXYS Merger Co., LLC ("Merger Sub Two") (the "Follow-On Merger", and collectively with the Initial Merger, the "Mergers"), with Merger Sub Two continuing as the
surviving company in the Follow-On Merger and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

        (b)   The text of Section 1.1(b) of the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with the following text:

        Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA"), immediately following the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with



9/19/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945699/000104746917007634/a2234030zdefm14a.htm

and into Merger Sub Two, whereupon the separate existence of the Company will cease, with Merger Sub Two surviving the Follow-On Merger, such that following the
Follow-On Merger, Merger Sub Two will be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub Two, as the surviving entity in the Follow-On Merger, sometimes
being referred to herein as the "Surviving Company"). The Follow-On Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL and the
DLLCA.

        (c)   The text of Section 1.3(b) of the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with the following text:

        Immediately following the Effective Time, the Parties shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Follow-On Merger (the "Follow-On Certificate of
Merger") to be duly executed and filed with the Delaware Secretary as provided under the DGCL and the DLLCA and make any other filings, recordings or publications
required to be made by the Company, Merger Sub Two or Parent under the DGCL and the DLLCA in connection with the Follow-On Merger. The Follow-On Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Follow-On Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary or on such other date and time as shall be agreed to
by the Company and Parent and specified in the Follow-On Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Follow-On Merger Effective
Time").

        (d)   The text of Section 1.4(b) of the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with the following text:

        The effects of the Follow-On Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Follow-On Merger Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub Two shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub Two shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under the DGCL and the DLLCA.

        (e)   The text of Section 1.5 of the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with the following text:

        At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Company, until the effective time of the Follow-On Merger. At the Follow-On Effective Time, the limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub Two, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company, until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

        (f)    The text of Section 1.6 of the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with the following text:

        Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Company as of the Effective Time and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Company as of the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to applicable Law, the managers of Merger Sub Two immediately prior to the Follow-On Merger Effective
Time shall be the initial managers of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

        (g)   The following text is hereby added as the text of a new clause (iv) of Section 2.1(a) of the Merger Agreement:

        (iv)    Conversion of Common Stock in the Follow-On Merger.    At the Follow-On Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Follow-On

Effective Time shall be converted into and become one limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company, and each limited liability company interest in Merger
Sub Two issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Follow-On Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest of the Surviving
Company.

        (h)   The defined term "Surviving Corporation" in the Merger Agreement is hereby replaced with "Surviving Company" and each reference to such defined term in the
Merger Agreement is hereby replaced accordingly.

        2.    Joinder.     Merger Sub Two hereby agrees to join, enter into and become a party to the Merger Agreement and agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Merger
Agreement as if originally named as a party thereto. Each of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges and agrees to the joinder of Merger Sub Two to the
Merger Agreement.

        3.    References.     Each reference in the Merger Agreement to "this Agreement," "hereof," "hereunder," "herein," "hereby" or words of like import referring to the Merger
Agreement shall mean and be a reference to the Merger Agreement as amended by this Amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all references in the Merger Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule to "the date hereof" or "the date of this Agreement" shall refer to August 25, 2017.

        4.    Effect of Amendment.     This Amendment shall not constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of the Merger Agreement not expressly amended or waived
herein and shall not be construed as an amendment, waiver or consent to any action that would require an amendment, waiver or consent except as expressly stated herein. The
Merger Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, is and shall continue to be in full force and effect and is in all respects ratified and confirmed hereby.

        5.    Counterparts.     This Amendment may be executed manually or by facsimile by the Parties, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Amendment by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Amendment.

        6.    Governing Law.     This Amendment, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Amendment or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

        7.    Other Miscellaneous Terms.     The provisions of Article VIII (Miscellaneous) of the Merger Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to this Amendment, and to the
Merger Agreement as modified by this Amendment, taken together as a single agreement, reflecting the terms as modified hereby.

Annex B 

August 25, 2017

Littelfuse, Inc.
8755 W. Higgins Road, Suite 500
Chicago, IL 60631

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        As a holder of Company Common Stock (as defined below), the undersigned (collectively, the "Stockholder") understands that IXYS Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), and Littelfuse, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), are concurrently entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated of even date herewith (as it may
be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), providing for, among other things, a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent with and into the Company,
followed by a merger of the Company with and into Parent (the "Mergers"), in which each of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the "Company Common Stock") (other than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time. Terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

        The Stockholder acknowledges that, as an inducement for Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that the Stockholder enter into this letter
agreement and the Stockholder is willing to enter into this letter agreement.

        The Stockholder confirms his, her or its agreement with Parent, and Parent confirms its agreement with the Stockholder, as follows:

        1.     As used in this letter agreement, "Shares" means the shares of Company Common Stock which the Stockholder owns of record or beneficially and has the
power to vote (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any shares underlying options exercisable for, or warrants to purchase, shares of Company Common Stock whether
or not such shares are included as beneficially owned by the Stockholder in the Company's most recent annual proxy statement) as of the date of this letter agreement.
The Shares are owned by the Stockholder free and clear of all encumbrances, voting arrangements and commitments of every kind, other than under applicable securities
Laws or as set forth on Schedule II hereto and except as would not restrict the performance of the Stockholder's obligations under this letter agreement. The Stockholder
represents and warrants that the Stockholder has the sole or shared power to vote or direct the vote of all Shares.

        2.     At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called, and at every postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the stockholders of the Company, the Stockholder agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares (a) in favor of (i) adoption of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) any other matter that is required to be approved by the stockholders of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (b) against (i) any proposal made in opposition to approval of the Merger Agreement or in support of any Company Takeover Transaction other than the
Mergers and (ii) any Company Takeover Proposal and (c) in favor of any postponement, recess or adjournment at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company
relating to any of the matters set forth in the foregoing clause (a) or (b) if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, in each case unless the Merger Agreement shall have been amended or modified to reduce the amount of Merger
Consideration. Any such vote shall be cast (or consent shall be given) by the Stockholder in accordance with such procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly
counted, including for purposes of determining that a quorum is present and for purposes of recording the

B-1

results of such vote (or consent). The Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise, any rights of appraisal, any dissenters' rights
or any similar rights relating to the Mergers that the Stockholder may directly or indirectly have by virtue of the ownership of any Shares.

        3.     The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Shares.

        4.     From and after the Effective Time until the earlier of (a) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Time and (b) February 1, 2019, the Stockholder
hereby agrees not to, and to cause its controlled Affiliates not to, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose
of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") or any options or warrants to purchase any Parent Common Stock, or any
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive Parent Common Stock, owned directly by the Stockholder (including holding as a
custodian) or with respect to which the Stockholder has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the SEC, or hereinafter acquired (collectively, the "Parent
Shares"), other than as provided herein or pursuant to any Permitted Transfer. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the Stockholder and its controlled
Affiliates from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of
shares of Parent Common Stock even if such shares of Parent Common Stock would be disposed of by someone other than the Stockholder. Such prohibited hedging or
other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option, swap or
similar arrangement) with respect to any of the Stockholder or its controlled Affiliates' shares of Parent Common Stock.

        5.     The Stockholder represents and warrants (a) that the Stockholder has duly executed and delivered this letter agreement and has all authority and full legal
capacity to enter into this letter agreement; and (b) that, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this letter agreement by Parent, this letter agreement is
the Stockholder's legal, valid and binding agreement and is enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to the general
principles of equity.

        6.     The Stockholder further represents and warrants that the execution and delivery of this letter agreement by the Stockholder does not, and the performance of
his, her or its obligations under this letter agreement and the consummation of the transactions to be consummated by him, her or it as contemplated hereby will not,
(a) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Stockholder or by which the Shares are bound or affected, (b) result in any breach of or violation of, or constitute a
default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of an encumbrance on any of the Shares pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder or the Shares are bound or affected, or (c) require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any court or arbitrator or any governmental entity, agency or official except for
(i) applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent, impair, delay or adversely affect the performance by the Stockholder of his, her or its obligations
under this letter agreement.

        7.     The Stockholder agrees that all representations, terms and conditions of this letter agreement will apply to shares of Company Common Stock of which the
Stockholder acquires record or beneficial ownership (and the power to vote) after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this letter agreement, whether upon the

earliest to occur of (a) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the earlier of the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Time and
February 1, 2019 and (c) the entry without the express prior written consent of the Stockholder into any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the
Merger Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof that (i) reduces the amount, or modifies the form, of the Merger Consideration payable to any of the stockholders of
the Company, or (ii) amends or modifies any of the closing conditions in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers; provided, however, that (x) this paragraph 8 and paragraphs 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23, 24
and 25 hereof shall survive any such termination and (y) such termination shall not relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful and intentional
breach of this letter agreement occurring prior to such termination; provided, further, that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee is payable to Parent and such Company Termination Fee is paid in full, Parent shall be precluded from any remedy against the Stockholder and
the Stockholder shall have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this letter agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, at law or in equity or otherwise, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of this letter agreement, and Parent shall not seek to obtain any
recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Stockholder or its Affiliates or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with this letter agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

        9.     The Stockholder is entering into this letter agreement solely in his, her or its capacity as a record or beneficial owner of the Shares and nothing herein is
intended to or shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder, solely in his, her or its capacity as a director or officer of the Company (or a Subsidiary of the
Company or as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries).

        10.   The Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure in connection with the Mergers the
Stockholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Stockholder's obligations under this letter agreement. The Company is an intended third-party
beneficiary of this paragraph 10.

        11.   The Stockholder agrees that, prior to the termination of this letter agreement, the Stockholder shall not take any action that would make any representation or
warranty of the Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing, impairing, delaying or adversely affecting the performance by the
Stockholder of his, her or its obligations under this letter agreement other than to a de minimis extent. The Stockholder agrees, without further consideration, to execute
and deliver such additional documents and to take such further actions as necessary or reasonably requested by Parent to confirm and assure the rights and obligations set
forth in this letter agreement.

        12.   THIS LETTER AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND
GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located
in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this letter agreement and of the documents referred to in this letter
agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such documents, that he, she or it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this letter agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts,
and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or federal court.
The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in paragraph 13 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

        13.   The parties to this letter agreement acknowledge and agree that any controversy which may arise under this letter agreement and the other documents
referred to in this letter agreement and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and,
therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating
to this letter agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
parties to this letter agreement certify and acknowledge that (a) such party has not represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver
voluntarily and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this letter agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
paragraph 13.

        14.   Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by either party to the other shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by facsimile or by overnight courier addressed, if to the Stockholder, to the address or facsimile number, as applicable, set
forth in Schedule I hereto, and, if to Parent, in accordance with Section 8.7 of the Merger Agreement, or to such other persons or addresses as may be designated in
writing by the party to receive such notice as provided above.

        15.   This letter agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise. Any purported assignment in violation of this letter agreement is void.

        16.   The Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this letter agreement will cause Parent to sustain
damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any such breach, Parent
shall be entitled to specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may
be entitled, at law or in equity. It is accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this letter agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this letter agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction.

Board of Directors
IXYS Corporation
1590 Buckeye Drive,
Milpitas, CA 95035

Gentlemen:

        We understand that Littelfuse, Inc. ("Parent"), IXYS Corporation (the "Company") and Iron Merger Co., Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), propose
to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") whereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the proposed Merger Agreement, we
understand that, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
("Company Common Stock"), other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement and collectively, "Excluded Shares"), will be
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof and subject to certain limitations and proration and election procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement
as to which we express no view or opinion, either (A) $23.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") or (B) 0.1265 of a share (the "Stock Consideration") of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"). The Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration, as applicable, is referred to herein as the "Consideration." The terms
and conditions of the Merger will be set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked us to advise you as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) of the
Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        For purposes of this opinion we have, among other things: (i) reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated August 25, 2017; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available
information concerning the Company and Parent and certain other relevant financial and operating data of the Company and Parent furnished to us by the Company and Parent;
(iii) reviewed the historical stock prices and trading volumes of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock; (iv) held discussions with members of management of the
Company and Parent concerning the current operations of and future business prospects for the Company and Parent and joint prospects for the combined companies, including
the potential cost savings and other synergies that may be achieved by the combined companies; (v) reviewed certain financial forecasts with respect to the Company prepared by
the management of the Company and held discussions with members of such management concerning those forecasts; (vi) reviewed certain research analyst projections with
respect to Parent and held discussions with members of the management of Parent concerning those projections; (vii) compared certain publicly available financial data of
companies whose securities are traded in the public markets and that we deemed generally relevant to similar data for the Company and Parent; (viii) reviewed the financial

terms of certain business combinations that we deemed generally relevant; and (ix) reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other matters as we
have deemed appropriate.

        In connection with our review and in arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, accounting, legal, tax and
other information discussed with or reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion and have neither attempted to verify independently nor assumed responsibility for verifying any
of such information. We have assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and all agreements related thereto. In addition, we
have assumed, with your consent, that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and that the Merger
will be consummated upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the draft Merger Agreement dated August 25, 2017 without waiver, modification or amendment of
any material term, condition or agreement thereof and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the Merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company, Parent or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. With respect to
the financial forecasts for the Company provided to us by the management of the Company, we have assumed, with your consent and based upon discussions with such
management, that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management, at the time of
preparation, of the future operating and financial performance of the Company. We have relied, without independent verification, upon the estimates of management of the
Company and Parent of the potential cost savings and other synergies, including the amount and timing thereof, that may be achieved as a result of the Merger. With respect to
the research analyst projections for Parent, we have assumed, with your consent and based upon discussions with the management of Parent, that such projections represent
reasonable estimates of the future financial performance of Parent. We express no opinion with respect to any of such forecasts (including such cost savings and other synergies),
estimates or projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

        We have not assumed any responsibility for or made or obtained any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or liabilities of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries under any state or
federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Further, our opinion is based on economic, monetary and market conditions as they exist and can be evaluated
as of the date hereof and we assume no responsibility to update or revise our opinion based upon circumstances and events occurring after the date hereof. Our opinion as
expressed herein is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) of the Consideration
to be received by such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement and we express no opinion with respect to any other terms or aspects of the Merger, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, the form of the Consideration, the allocation of the Consideration as between holders of Company Common Stock who receive the
Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration or a combination thereof or the relative fairness of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration. In addition, we express no
opinion as to the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies
of the Company, or as to the Company's underlying business decision to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business strategies that
might be available to the Company. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation payable to or to be
received by any officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of the Company as to whether such

Common Stock will actually trade at any time.

        We have been engaged by the Company as financial advisor in connection with the Merger and to render this opinion, and will receive fees for our services, a portion of
which is payable upon rendering of this opinion, and a substantial portion of which is contingent on the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to
indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our role as financial advisor and out of the rendering of this opinion and to reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket
expenses. In the past two years, we have not provided investment banking or financial advisory services to the Company unrelated to our current engagement with respect to the
proposed Merger for which we have received or are entitled to receive compensation. We have not in the past two years provided investment banking or financial advisory
services to Parent or Merger Sub for which we have received or are entitled to receive compensation. We may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory
services to the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates unrelated to the Merger, for which services we would expect to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of our
business, we may actively trade the equity securities of the Company and Parent for our own account or for the accounts of customers or affiliates and, accordingly, may at any
time hold a long or short position in such securities.

        This letter and the opinion expressed herein are provided at the request and for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be disclosed publicly,
quoted or referred to or used for any other purpose without our prior written consent, except that this letter may be disclosed in connection with any proxy, information or
solicitation/recommendation statement used in connection with the Merger provided that this letter is quoted in full in such proxy, information or solicitation/recommendation
statement. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Needham & Company, LLC.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Annex D 

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Section 262

§ 262 Appraisal rights

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to
such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
"stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
"depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251
(other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258,
§ 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior

to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock
as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and
(g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members
who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of
each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger
or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be

sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's
shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second
notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled
to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice
that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to
receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is
given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)
and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement
described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days
after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall
be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The
Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal
rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as
provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates
upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal

proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an
appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in
the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or
consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
