SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

 
MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

 
Dear Stockholder:
 

The board of directors of Omega Protein Corporation, a Nevada corporation, or Omega, has unanimously adopted and approved a
merger agreement pursuant to which Omega will be acquired by Cooke Inc., a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the
Province of New Brunswick, Canada, or Cooke, through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooke with and into Omega. The
proxy statement is dated November 24, 2017, and is first being mailed to our stockholders on or about November 27, 2017.
 

If the merger contemplated by the merger agreement is completed, (i) holders of our common stock will have their shares
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive $22.00 in cash, less any required withholding taxes (the “merger
consideration”), for each share of our common stock owned at the effective time of the merger, (ii) each outstanding option to
purchase shares of our common stock (whether or not exercisable, each an “Omega Option”) will become fully exercisable and will be
converted into the right to receive, less applicable withholding taxes, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of $22.00 over the
applicable per share exercise price of such Omega Option and (iii) the restrictions applicable to each share of our restricted common
stock will immediately lapse and each such share of our restricted common stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration. This consideration will be paid without interest. Receipt of this consideration in exchange for shares of our common
stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 

Our stockholders will be asked to vote on: (i) a proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement (which is a condition to the
merger) at a special meeting of stockholders (the “merger proposal”), (ii) an advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation
that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger (the “advisory, non-binding
compensation proposal”), and (iii) a proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal
(the “adjournment proposal”). Our board of directors has approved resolutions (i) adopting, approving, declaring advisable and
authorizing the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, (ii) directing that the merger be
submitted to the stockholders of Omega for approval at a meeting of such stockholders and (iii) recommending that stockholders of
Omega approve the merger and the merger agreement, compensation that may or will become payable to our named executive officers
in connection with the merger and all other actions or matters necessary or advisable to give effect to the merger and merger
agreement pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes. Our board of directors recommends that all of our stockholders vote “FOR”
the merger proposal, the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.
 

The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to approve the
merger proposal. Additionally, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented
by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve each of the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal
and the adjournment proposal.  Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Proxies returned to us that are
properly signed and dated but not marked to indicate your voting preference will be counted as votes “FOR” the merger proposal,
the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

Omega Protein Corporation
 

Omega is a nutritional products company incorporated in Nevada that develops, produces and delivers nutrition products
throughout the world to improve the nutritional integrity of foods, dietary supplements and animal feeds. Omega operates in two
primary industry segments: animal nutrition and human nutrition. Omega’s animal nutrition segment is comprised primarily of two
subsidiaries: Omega Protein, Inc. (“OPI”) and Omega Shipyard, Inc. (“Omega Shipyard”). OPI, our principal operating subsidiary, is
predominantly dedicated to the production of animal nutrition products and operates in the menhaden harvesting and processing
business and is the successor to a business conducted since 1913. A portion of OPI’s production is transferred to Omega’s human
nutrition business. Omega Shipyard owns and operates a dry-dock facility in Moss Point, Mississippi that is used to provide shore side
maintenance for OPI’s fishing fleet. The human nutrition business operates under the “tera’s®” branded product and “Bioriginal”
names. Bioriginal has three primary product lines: specialty oils, protein products and other nutraceutical ingredients. Bioriginal is
comprised primarily of three subsidiaries: Bioriginal Food & Science Corp. (“Bioriginal Food & Science”), Wisconsin Specialty
Protein, L.L.C. (“WSP”) and Cyvex Nutrition, Inc. (“Cyvex”). Bioriginal Food & Science, acquired by Omega in September 2014 and
headquartered in Saskatoon, Canada with additional operations in the Netherlands, is a supplier of plant and marine based specialty
oils to the food and nutraceutical industries. WSP, acquired by Omega in 2013, is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty dairy
proteins and other related products headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin and operates a production facility in Reedsburg, Wisconsin.
Cyvex, acquired by Omega in 2010, is located in Irvine, California and is an ingredient supplier for the food and nutraceutical
industries. Omega’s Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “OME.” Omega’s principal executive office is located at
2105 City West Blvd., Suite 500, Houston, Texas 77042 and the telephone number of its principal executive office is 713-623-0600.

Canada with salmon farming operations carried on through its wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S. (off the coasts of Maine and
Washington), Chile and Scotland, as well as seabass and seabream farming operations in Spain. Cooke Aquaculture also manages the
salmon farming operations of its affiliate Kelly Cove Salmon Ltd., which are located in Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick,
Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island). Members of the founding Cooke family, who collectively are
the ultimate beneficial owners of all of the shares of Cooke, also have significant investments in wild fisheries globally through their
ownership of Cooke Seafood USA, Inc. (“Cooke Seafood”) and Icicle Seafoods, Inc. (“Icicle”). Cooke’s principal executive office is

merger consideration and option consideration in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a

Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of The Omega Board
 

(Page 34)
 

At a meeting of our board of directors (the “Omega Board”) held on October 5, 2017, the Omega Board approved, adopted,
declared advisable and authorized in all respects the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger. The Omega Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Omega vote “FOR” the approval of the merger, the
merger agreement and all other actions or matters necessary or desirable to give effect to the merger and merger agreement pursuant to
the NRS. In the course of reaching its decision, the Omega Board consulted with our senior management and our financial and legal
advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors, including, among others:
 

 

● the fact that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration represented a 32.9% premium to $16.55, the
closing price of Common Stock on October 4, 2017, the last trading day prior to the approval of the merger by the Omega
Board, and the belief of the Omega Board that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as the merger consideration was the
highest price per share that Cooke was willing to agree to pay and that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash
without a financing contingency;

 

 
● information with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and business strategy

October 5, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the merger
consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such stockholders, as more fully described below under the caption “The Merger—Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor
Regarding the Merger Consideration ” beginning on page 38 of this proxy statement. The full text of the written opinion of

● the likelihood that the merger would be completed in light of, among other things, the conditions to the merger and the

absence of a financing condition, the absence of any condition related to the receipt of third party commercial consents or
approvals and the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals;

 

 
● Cooke’s representation that it will have sufficient financial resources to pay the merger consideration and the option

consideration and consummate the merger and the remedies available to us under the merger agreement in the event of
various breaches by Cooke or the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals;

 

 
● the current state of the economy, debt financing markets, political climate and general uncertainty surrounding forecasted

economic and political conditions, both in the near term and the longer term, and both generally and within our industry;
 

 
● the risk that the announcement and pendency of the merger, including the restrictions on the conduct of our business, may

cause harm to relationships with our employees, agents, customers and partners and may divert management and employee
attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business;

 

 

● the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the merger will be
satisfied, and, as a result, the possibility necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied and that the
merger might not be consummated, and further noted that these risks may be heightened due to the requirement for MARAD
Approval and antitrust approvals;

 

 
● the risk that, while the merger agreement is not by its terms subject to a financing condition, if Cooke fails to obtain sufficient

financing (notwithstanding the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and DNB Credit Facility), the merger may not be
consummated; and

 

 
● the fact that Omega will no longer exist as an independent public company and Omega’s stockholders will forego any future

increase in Omega’s value that might result from our earnings or possible growth.
 

In the course of its deliberations, the Omega Board also considered a number of additional potentially positive factors and a
number of additional potentially negative factors regarding the merger, as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger—
Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of The Omega Board.” The Omega Board concluded that, overall, the potentially
positive factors outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, the Omega Board approved, adopted, declared advisable and
authorized in all respects the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.
 
Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration
 

(Page 38)
 

Omega retained J.P. Morgan to act as financial advisor to the Omega Board in connection with the proposed merger. At the
meeting of the Omega Board on October 5, 2017, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Omega Board that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by
J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the Common Stock in the proposed merger
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan confirmed this oral opinion by delivering its written opinion
to the Omega Board, dated October 5, 2017.
 

The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated October 5, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. Omega’s stockholders are urged to read
the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Omega Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed merger, was directed only to the merger consideration to
be paid in the proposed merger and did not address any other aspect of the proposed merger. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of Omega as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or
any other matter. For a description of the opinion that the Omega Board received from J.P. Morgan, see “The Merger—
Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration” beginning on page 38 of this proxy statement.

Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger
 

(Page 45)
 

In considering the recommendation of the Omega Board with respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be
aware that our executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
our stockholders generally. Interests of directors and executive officers that may be different from or in addition to the interests of
Omega’s stockholders generally include:
 

 
● The merger agreement provides for the conversion of all Omega Options, including Omega Options held by Bret D. Scholtes

and certain directors with exercise prices less than the $22.00 per share merger consideration, into the right to receive the
option consideration;

 

 
● The merger agreement also provides that the restrictions applicable to each share of Omega Restricted Stock granted under

Omega’s equity plans, including shares of Omega Restricted Stock held by our executive officers at the effective time of the
merger, will immediately lapse and each share will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration;

 

 
● The merger agreement further provides that all amounts owed pursuant to outstanding Performance Units (as defined below),

including Performance Units held by our executive officers, will be accelerated and due as of the effective time of the merger
in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan;

 

 
● Possible cash payments and other benefits payable under award agreements and/or employment agreements with our

executive officers either upon the consummation of the merger or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment
following the merger; and

 

 
● Requirements to provide indemnification and insurance for our directors and executive officers by the surviving corporation

following the merger.
 

The Omega Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in making its determinations and
recommendations in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.
 
Regulatory Matters
 

(Page 52)
 

U.S. Antitrust Approval
 

Under the HSR Act, we cannot complete the merger until we and Cooke give notification and furnish information to the Federal
Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and until the applicable waiting period expires or is
terminated. On October 19, 2017, we and Cooke each filed a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act. On October
30, 2017, U.S. antitrust authorities notified Omega and Cooke that early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act had been
granted.
 

Foreign Antitrust Approval
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will require filings and approvals
pursuant to Germany’s Act against Restraints of Competition and filings pursuant to Canada’s Competition Act. We and Cooke
submitted the requisite filings in Canada and Germany on October 27, 2017. We obtained approval from the German competition
authorities on November 22, 2017.

Table of Contents
 

MARAD
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will require the approval of
MARAD. Omega has agreed to reasonably assist Cooke in the preparation for the sale of certain or all of the MARAD Assets
(including by transferring such MARAD Assets and FAA Assets identified by Cooke and related employees to the MARAD
Subsidiary) pursuant to the MARAD Sale Agreement. Additionally, each of Omega and Cooke has agreed to comply in all material
respects with all of its obligations under the MARAD Sale Agreement, and each of Cooke and Merger Sub has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approval of MARAD, including causing its
affiliates to enter into the Fish Supply Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement on or prior to the closing date of the merger.
 

Judgments and Probation Conditions
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will require OPI to notify and
obtain permission of its Probation Officer required as part of its obligations to sell, assign or transfer assets (including the affected
marine vessels) that are subject to the Judgments and Probation Conditions. On November 15, 2017, OPI's probation officer notified
OPI that she would not have any objection to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and OPI intends to file an
appropriate notice with the relevant courts prior to the consummation of the merger.
 

FAA and FCC Approvals
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the MARAD Sale Agreement, including the
transfer of certain radio licenses and spotter aircraft from OPI, will require the consent of the FAA and the FCC.
 
No Appraisal Rights
 

(Page 53)
 

Pursuant to Section 92A.390 of the NRS, no holder of any shares of Common Stock will have or will be entitled to assert
dissenter’s rights or any rights of appraisal as a result of or in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger.
 
Financing of the Merger
 

(Page 53)
 

The obligation of Cooke and Merger Sub to complete the merger is not conditioned upon Cooke obtaining financing. The total
amount of funds necessary to consummate the merger and the related transactions will be funded by Cooke, including the funds
needed to (i) pay our stockholders the aggregate merger consideration due to them under the merger agreement; (ii) pay the option
consideration; and (iii) pay fees and expenses payable by Cooke and Merger Sub under the merger agreement and in connection with
the debt financing described in the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger.” Cooke estimates that the total amount of
funds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions will be approximately $525 million. 
 
Delisting and Deregistration of the Common Stock
 

(Page 54)
 

If the merger is completed, the Common Stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE and will be delisted and deregistered under
the Exchange Act.
 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
 

(Page 54)
 

The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will recognize capital gain or loss
equal to the difference, if any, between the sum of any cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in our Common Stock.

Except in certain specific circumstances described in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”, a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding taxes on any gain recognized on the exchange of our
Common Stock for any cash in the merger.

The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your
own tax advisors to determine how the merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the
merger, see the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on
page 54 of this proxy statement.
 
Litigation Relating to the Merger
 

(Page 56)
 

Four putative class action lawsuits related to the merger have been filed against Omega, one of Omega’s officers and seven of
Omega’s directors. Omega believes the allegations in these complaints are without merit. See “The Merger—Litigation Relating to the
Merger.”
 
The Merger Agreement
 
When the Merger Becomes Effective
 

(Page 58)
 

The merger agreement provides that the completion of the merger of Merger Sub with and into Omega will take place no later
than the third business day after the satisfaction (or waiver) of the last to occur of the conditions to the completion of the merger (as
described below), other than any such conditions which by their nature can only be satisfied at closing, which will be required to be
satisfied (or waived) at that time; provided, however, that if the Marketing Period has not ended at least two business days prior to the
date on which the closing would otherwise occur, the closing will instead occur on the earliest of:
 

 
● a date specified by Cooke during the Marketing Period that is a business day on no fewer than two business days’ notice of

such date from Cooke to Omega;
 
 ● the second business day immediately following the last day of the Marketing Period; and
 

 
● February 8, 2018, which is the second business day prior to February 11, 2018 (the “Outside Date”) (in each case subject to

the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to the completion of the merger (other than any such conditions which by
their nature can only be satisfied at closing, which are required to be so satisfied (or waived) at that time)).

 
The Marketing Period is a fifteen (15) consecutive business day period (subject to certain blackout dates) that will commence

upon the receipt of certain specified required information by the lead arranger named in the Debt Commitment Letter, BMO Capital
Markets Corp. (the “Lead Arranger”), subject to certain conditions.
 

We are working to complete the merger as promptly as practicable. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions
set forth in the merger agreement, we anticipate that the merger will be completed by the end of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018.
However, we cannot assure completion of the merger by any particular date, if at all.
 
Treatment of Equity Awards
 

(Page 58)
 

Omega Options
 

The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding Omega Option will become fully
exercisable (if not then fully exercisable) and will thereafter represent only the right to receive, upon delivery of an option surrender
agreement in the form attached to the merger agreement (an “option surrender agreement”), the option consideration.

Table of Contents
 

Restricted Stock 
 

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the restrictions applicable to
each share of Omega Restricted Stock will immediately lapse, and, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Omega Restricted
Stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.
 
No Solicitation
 

(Page 64)
 

Pursuant to the merger agreement, we have agreed not to:
 

 
● solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of an Acquisition Proposal or inquiries or proposals that

could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation”);
 

 
● enter into or participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations with, any third party regarding any Acquisition

Proposal or any inquiries or proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
 

 
● furnish any confidential information or access to the properties, books, records or personnel of Omega or any subsidiary of

Omega to any third party that has made, or informs Omega that it is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal; or
 

 
● enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or stock purchase or other acquisition

agreement or other contract or agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by the merger agreement)
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or requiring Omega to abandon or terminate its obligations under the merger agreement.

 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement described above, at any time prior to obtaining the Omega Stockholder

Approval, in response to (i) an Acquisition Proposal that the Omega Board determines in good faith constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation”), or (ii) an inquiry relating to an
Acquisition Proposal by a third party that the Omega Board determines in good faith is credible and reasonably capable of making a
Superior Proposal (an “Inquiry”), Omega, directly or indirectly through its representatives may:
 
 ● engage in negotiations or discussions with such third party and its representatives; and
 

 
● furnish to such third party or its representatives information relating to Omega or any subsidiary of Omega and access to the

properties, books, records or personnel of Omega and its subsidiaries, in each case, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in the merger agreement).

 
Without any determination of the Omega Board as set forth in the preceding two bullets, Omega, directly or indirectly through its

representatives, may have discussions with any third party that has made an Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry solely in order to clarify
and understand the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and the ability of such third party to consummate a
Superior Proposal. Omega must make available to Cooke any material information relating to Omega or its subsidiaries that is made
available to such third party which was not previously made available to Cooke at substantially the same time it is made available to
such third party.

Change of Recommendation
 

(Page 66)
 

Pursuant to the merger agreement, neither the Omega Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Cooke, the recommendation by the Omega Board of the
merger agreement to Omega’s stockholders or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal (each such action, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”). Notwithstanding the foregoing
restriction, the Omega Board or any committee thereof may, (a) in response to a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the Superior Proposal termination right, or (b) in response to
an Intervening Event (as defined in “The Merger Agreement—Change of Recommendation”), make an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Omega Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, in each of (a) and (b), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions described in “The Merger
Agreement—Change of Recommendation.”
 
Conditions to Completion of the Merger
 

(Page 73)

certain conditions, including, but not limited to:

conditions, including, but not limited to:
 

 

● Omega has performed or complied in all material respects with its obligations required to be performed by it under the

Holdings has performed or complied with all of its obligations under the MARAD Sale Agreement required to be performed
by it (the “MARAD performance condition”);

merger agreement at or prior to the effective time of the merger (the “Omega performance condition”);

satisfied at closing, which are required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived), and (B)
the closing has not been consummated within three business days after the delivery of notice to Cooke that the conditions

termination pursuant to the adverse stockholder vote termination right, prior to the special meeting or (ii) in the case of
termination for an Omega terminable breach of the non-solicitation covenants contained in the merger agreement, prior to the

Market Price of Our Common Stock
 

(Page 80)
 

Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “OME.” On October 4, 2017, the last trading day prior to the
approval of the merger by the Omega Board, the Common Stock closed at $16.55. On November 22, 2017, the last practicable trading
day prior to the date of this proxy statement, the Common Stock closed at $21.90. We encourage you to obtain a current market
quotation for the Common Stock in connection with voting your shares but caution stockholders that, during the pendency of the
merger, the trading price of the Common Stock may be impacted by the fact that we have entered into the merger agreement and
investors’ speculating as to the likelihood and timing of the closing of the merger or the likelihood of a Superior Proposal.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING
 

The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the
merger agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you
as a stockholder. Please refer to the “Summary” and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the
annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you should
read carefully. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
 
Q: What is the merger?
 
A: The merger is the acquisition of Omega by Cooke pursuant to the merger agreement. Once the merger agreement has been

approved and adopted by Omega’s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Omega. Omega will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooke.

 
Q: Why am I receiving the proxy materials?
 
A: You are receiving this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card or enclosed voting instruction form because the Omega Board

is soliciting your proxy to vote at the special meeting of Omega’s stockholders in connection with a proposal to adopt and approve
the merger agreement. In addition, the Omega Board is soliciting your vote on the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal
and the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What will I receive in the merger if I am an owner of Common Stock?
 
A: If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $22.00, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, for

each share of Common Stock that you own at the effective time of the merger. For example, if you own 100 shares of Common
Stock, you will receive $2,200.00 in cash, less any required withholding taxes, in exchange for those shares. You will not receive
any shares of capital stock in the surviving corporation.

 
Q: How does the Omega Board recommend I vote?
 
A: The Omega Board unanimously recommends that all of our stockholders vote “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger

proposal. The reasons for the Omega Board’s determination are discussed in this proxy statement. Additionally, the Omega Board
unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal.

 
Q: What factors did the Omega Board consider in evaluating the merger agreement and the merger?
 
A: In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Omega Board consulted with our senior management team and outside

legal and financial advisors and, in reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger and to
recommend that our shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement, the Omega Board considered a variety of factors,
including positive factors and negative factors concerning the merger.

 
Some of the selected positive factors considered by the Omega Board included, among other things:

 

 

● the fact that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration represented a 32.9% premium to $16.55, the
closing price of Common Stock on October 4, 2017, the last trading day prior to the approval of the merger by the Omega
Board, and the belief of the Omega Board that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as the merger consideration was the
highest price per share that Cooke was willing to agree to pay and that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash
without a financing contingency;

● the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan, delivered to the Omega Board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
October 5, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the merger
consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such stockholders, as more fully described below under the caption “The Merger—Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor
Regarding the Merger Consideration ” beginning on page 38 of this proxy statement;

 

 
● the business reputation and capabilities of Cooke and its management, Cooke’s experience executing acquisitions and its

commitment to its growth strategy, the resources available to Cooke to complete the merger and the commercial incentives of
Cooke to timely obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and complete the merger; and

 

 
● the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and DNB Credit Facility provided to Cooke in connection with the merger and the

commitments of Cooke to make the proceeds of the Debt Commitment Letter and DNB Credit Facility available to fund the
merger consideration, together with the financial capabilities and reputation of the financing sources.

 
Some of the negative factors considered by the Omega Board included, among other things:

 

 
● the risk that the announcement and pendency of the merger, including the restrictions on the conduct of our business,

may cause harm to relationships with our employees, agents, customers and partners and may divert management and
employee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business;

 

 

● the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the merger will be
satisfied, and, as a result, the possibility necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied and that
the merger might not be consummated, and further noted that these risks may be heightened due to the requirement for
MARAD Approval and antitrust approvals;

 

 
● the risk that, while the merger agreement is not by its terms subject to a financing condition, if Cooke fails to obtain

sufficient financing (notwithstanding the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and DNB Credit Facility), the merger
may not be consummated; and

 

 
● the fact that Omega will no longer exist as an independent public company and Omega’s stockholders will forego any

future increase in Omega’s value that might result from our earnings or possible growth.
 

The above factors were not given greater weight than other factors considered by our board of directors. For a more detailed
description of the factors considered by our board of directors when evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, which we
encourage shareholders to read in their entirety, see “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of the
Omega Board” beginning on page 34.

 
After careful consideration of both positive and negative factors associated with the merger agreement and the merger, the Omega
Board unanimously determined that, in the aggregate, the positive factors outweighed the negative factors. Therefore, the Omega
Board approved, adopted, declared advisable and authorized in all respects the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger.

 
Q: Who will own Omega after the merger?
 
A: After the merger, Omega will be an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cooke. As a result of the receipt of cash in exchange for

your shares of Common Stock following the merger, you will no longer benefit from any increase in Omega’s value, nor will you
acquire an ownership interest in Cooke.

 
Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 
A: We are working to complete the merger as soon as possible. The merger cannot be completed until each closing condition has

been satisfied or, to the extent legally permitted, waived. While we cannot predict the exact timing of the closing of the merger or
whether the merger will be consummated, assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, we anticipate that the
merger will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2017 or first quarter of 2018. If our stockholders vote to adopt and approve
the merger agreement, the merger will become effective as promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions to the merger, subject to certain extensions related to the Marketing Period as discussed in “The Merger
Agreement—When the Merger Becomes Effective.” See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion
of the Merger” beginning on page 73 of this proxy statement.

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A: If the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,

our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock. Instead, we will remain an independent public
company and the Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. Under specified circumstances, we may be
required to pay to Cooke a fee, or Cooke may be required to pay us a fee, with respect to the termination of the merger agreement
as described under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 74 of this
proxy statement.

 
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to me?
 
A: The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section

entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will recognize capital gain or
loss equal to the difference, if any, between the sum of any cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Common Stock. Except in certain specific circumstances described in “The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”, a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or
withholding taxes on any gain recognized on the exchange of our Common Stock for any cash in the merger. The tax
consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax
advisors to determine how the merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the merger,
see the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page
54 of this proxy statement.

 
Q: What will happen in the merger to stock options and restricted stock that have been granted to employees, officers and

directors of Omega?
 
A: The merger agreement provides that each Omega Option will become exercisable at the effective time of the merger and be

converted into the right to receive the option consideration and the restrictions applicable to each share of Omega Restricted Stock
will immediately lapse at the effective time of the merger and be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

 
Q: Do any of our directors or officers have interests in the merger that differ from or are in addition to my interests as a

stockholder?
 
A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Omega Board with respect to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement,

you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of our stockholders generally. The Omega Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters,
in making its determinations and recommendations in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger” beginning
on page 45 of this proxy statement.

 
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 
A: The special meeting of our stockholders will be held on December 19, 2017, at 9 a.m. Central Time, at First City Tower, 1001

Fannin St., Suite 2500, Houston, TX 77002.
 
Q: What vote is needed to adopt and approve the merger agreement?
 
A: The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the shares of our outstanding Common Stock as of the record date is

required to adopt and approve the merger agreement.

Q: Why are we asking that our stockholders approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, certain compensation arrangements

for our named executive officers?
 
A: The SEC rules require that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote on this proposal. However, approval of this

proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is only an advisory vote by
stockholders. Accordingly, the vote will not be binding on us or Cooke, the Omega Board or their board of directors or our
compensation committee. If the merger is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the proposal will be paid to our
named executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if
our stockholders do not approve this proposal.

 
Q: What vote is needed to approve the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal?
 
A: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special

meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal.
 
Q: Why are we asking that our stockholders approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, if necessary or

appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
merger proposal?

 
A: The SEC rules require that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote on this proposal. Although it is not currently

expected, we may wish to adjourn, recess or postpone the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. In the
event that there is present, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Omega Stockholder Approval to
adopt and approve the merger agreement, Omega does not anticipate that it will need to adjourn or postpone the special meeting
unless such adjournment or postponement is necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to this proxy
statement is provided to the Omega stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the special meeting or Omega
is advised by counsel that failure to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of applicable law

 
Q: What vote is needed to approve the adjournment proposal?
 
A: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special

meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal.
 
Q: Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the NRS?
 
A: No. Pursuant to Section 92A.390 of the NRS, no holder of any shares of Common Stock will have or will be entitled to assert

dissenter’s rights or any rights of appraisal as a result of or in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger.

 
Q: Who can vote at the special meeting?
 
A: Stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 24, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to

receive notice of the special meeting and vote their shares at the meeting. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for
each share of the Common Stock held on the record date on each of the proposals set forth in this proxy statement. There is no
cumulative voting.

 
Q: How do I vote if I am the record holder of my shares?
 
A: You are entitled to vote at the meeting if you are a stockholder of record on the record date. You may vote:
 
 ● in person by appearing and casting your vote at the special meeting; or
 
 ● by proxy.
 
 ● Stockholders of record have a choice of submitting a proxy:
 
 ● by using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card;

 ● by using the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy card; or
 

 
● by completing, signing, dating and returning each enclosed proxy card you receive in the enclosed postage paid

envelope.
 

If you are granting a proxy to vote by telephone or via the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by the date and time
indicated on the applicable proxy card(s).

 
Granting a proxy to vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing in your proxy card will not prevent you from voting in
person at the special meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, via the Internet or by telephone even if you plan to
attend the special meeting in person, to ensure that your shares of Common Stock are present in person or represented at the
special meeting.

 
If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be
voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the special meeting, shares present in person or represented
by all proxies received by Omega will be voted with respect to such matter in accordance with the judgment of the persons named
as attorneys-in-fact in the proxies.

 
Q: How do I vote if my shares are held by my brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee?
 
A: If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then you are considered to be the

beneficial owner of those shares, with your shares being held in “street name.” “Street name” holders generally cannot vote their
shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares. Your brokerage
firm, bank, trust or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares for you at the special meeting if you instruct it how
to vote. Therefore, it is important that you promptly follow the directions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee regarding how to instruct it to vote your shares. If you wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must bring a
proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

 
In addition, because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any
shares you hold of record, shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record.
To be sure your shares are voted, you should instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares. Shares
held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity.

 
Q: What happens if I do not vote?
 
A: The vote to adopt and approve the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of

the close of business on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote
against the merger proposal, the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?
 
A: If your shares are registered in your name with Omega’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are the

“stockholder of record” of those shares. In that case, the proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been provided
directly to you by Omega.

 
If your shares are not registered in your own name and, instead, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee holds your shares, you
are a “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name.” The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of
record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. The proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been forwarded
to you by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust
or other nominee how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card or by following their instructions for voting by
telephone or on the Internet.

Q: How can I change or revoke my vote?
 
A: Proxies may be revoked or changed if you:
 

 
● deliver a signed, written revocation letter, dated later than the proxy and which must be received prior to the special meeting,

to Omega Protein Corporation, 2105 City West Blvd., Suite 500, Houston, Texas 77042, Attention: Corporate Secretary;
 

 
● deliver a signed proxy, dated later than the prior proxy and which must be received prior to the special meeting, to American

Stock Transfer & Trust Company at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219;
 
 ● vote again by telephone or on the Internet by 11:59 p.m. on the day before the special meeting; or
 

 
● attend the special meeting and give notice to the inspector of election that you intend to vote in person rather than by proxy.

Your attendance at the special meeting will not revoke your proxy unless you choose to vote in person.
 

If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you must contact such broker, bank, trust or other
nominee and follow its procedures to revoke your proxy.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 
A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a proxy, to vote your shares of stock. The written document

describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a proxy statement. The document used to
designate a proxy to vote your shares of stock is called a proxy card. The Omega Board has designated Bret D. Scholtes, Andrew
C. Johannesen and John D. Held, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the special meeting.

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Common Stock voted?
 
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, as your proxies, will vote your

shares of Common Stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card,
you may specify whether your shares of Common Stock should be voted for or against, or to abstain from voting, on all, some or
none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.

 
If you are the stockholder of record, and you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares
should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt and
approve the merger agreement, “FOR” the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and for “FOR” the adjournment
proposal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, your broker will not be able to vote your shares without
instructions from you.

 
Q: What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
 
A: If you hold shares of Common Stock in “street name” and also directly as a record holder or otherwise, you may receive more

than one proxy and/or set of voting instructions relating to the special meeting. Each proxy should be voted and/or returned
separately in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your shares of
Common Stock are voted.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?
 
A: The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you

transfer your shares of Common Stock after the record date but before the special meeting you will, unless special arrangements
are made, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration to the
person to whom you transfer your shares.

Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
 
A: The expenses of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the proxies solicited thereby will be borne by us. Our

directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person (all
written soliciting materials, including scripts to be used in soliciting proxies, will be filed with the SEC). They will not be paid
any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.

 
We have engaged Morrow Sodali LLC (“Morrow Sodali”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. We
estimate that we will pay Morrow Sodali a fee of approximately $15,000 in addition to an expense reimbursement. We will
reimburse Morrow Sodali for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Morrow Sodali and its affiliates against
certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses.

 
We may also reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of shares of
Common Stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock and in obtaining
voting instructions from those owners.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 
A: Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy

statement, please submit a proxy promptly to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. If you hold
your shares of Common Stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, please submit a proxy to have your shares of
Common Stock voted at the special meeting by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope; by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card; or by using the Internet
instructions printed on your proxy card. If you decide to attend the special meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot will
revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you.

 
Q: Should I send in my Omega stock certificates now?
 
A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock or book-

entry shares, as applicable, for the merger consideration for each share of Common Stock that you own at the effective time of the
merger, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.

 
Q: I do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the merger consideration for my shares?
 
A: If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will include the

procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to
sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. Omega may also require that you provide a customary indemnity agreement to
Omega in order to cover any potential loss.

 
Q: Who can help answer my other questions?
 
A: If you have additional questions about the merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of Common

Stock, or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please call Morrow Sodali, our proxy solicitor,
who may be contacted by banks and brokers at 1-203-658-9400 and by all others toll-free at 1-800-662-5200.

THE SPECIAL MEETING
 

We are furnishing this proxy statement to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Omega Board for use at the
special meeting, and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.
 
Date, Time and Place
 

We will hold the special meeting at First City Tower,  1001 Fannin St., Suite 2500, Houston, TX 77002, at 9 a.m., Central Time,
on December 19, 2017.
 
Purpose of Special Meeting
 

At the special meeting, we will ask holders of Common Stock to adopt and approve the merger agreement. Our stockholders will
also be asked to approve the advisory, non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.
 
Record Date, Stock Entitled to Vote and Quorum
 

Only holders of record of Common Stock at the close of business on November 24, 2017, which is the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, 22,478,928 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding and held by approximately 29 holders of record. A majority of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting is required for a quorum. Shares
of Common Stock represented at the special meeting but not voting, including shares of Common Stock for which proxies have been
received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining the
presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business at the special meeting.
 
Vote Required
 

The proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote as of the record date. Accordingly, if you abstain or fail to vote on the proposal
to adopt and approve the merger agreement, or if you fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker,
bank or other nominee, you must direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares of Common Stock by following
their instructions for voting. Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Common Stock in street name for customers who
are the beneficial owners of those shares are not permitted to vote those customers’ shares in the absence of specific instructions from
those customers.
 

The advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to Omega’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote. Accordingly, not attending the special meeting in person or by proxy
will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal, but abstentions will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. Approval of
this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is only an advisory vote by
stockholders. Accordingly, the vote will not be binding on us or the Omega Board or our compensation committee, Cooke or their
board of directors. If the merger is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the proposal may be paid to our named executive
officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if our stockholders do
not approve this proposal.
 

The proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote.
Accordingly, not attending the special meeting in person or by proxy will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal, but
abstentions will have the effect of a vote against this proposal.

Common Stock, or approximately 2.7% of the outstanding Common Stock at that date.
 
Voting of Proxies

in the manner specified by the holders thereof. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR”

to Omega Protein Corporation, 2105 City West Blvd., Suite 500, Houston, Texas 77042, Attention: Corporate Secretary;

Your attendance at the special meeting will not revoke your proxy unless you choose to vote in person.
 

If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you must contact such broker, bank, trust or other
nominee and follow its procedures to revoke your proxy.

statement.
 
Delivery of Proxy Materials to Households Where Two or More Omega Stockholders Reside
 

Because many stockholders hold shares of Common Stock in multiple accounts or share an address with other stockholders,
stockholders may receive duplicate mailings of notices or proxy materials. Stockholders may avoid receiving duplicate mailings as
follows:
 

 
● Stockholders of Record. If your shares are registered in your own name and you are interested in consenting to the delivery of

a single notice or single set of proxy materials, you may contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company by phone at 1-
800-627-7020 or by mail to 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219.

 

 

● Beneficial Stockholders. If your shares are not registered in your own name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee that
holds your shares may have asked you to consent to the delivery of a single notice or single set of proxy materials if there are
other Omega stockholders who share an address with you. If you currently receive more than one copy of the notice or proxy
materials at your household and would like to receive only one copy in the future, you should contact your nominee.

 

 

● Right to Request Separate Copies. If you consent to the delivery of a single notice or single set of proxy materials but later
decide that you would prefer to receive a separate copy of the notice or proxy materials, as applicable, for each stockholder
sharing your address, then please notify American Stock Transfer & Trust Company or your nominee, as applicable, and they
will promptly deliver the additional notices or proxy materials. If you wish to receive a separate copy of the notice or proxy
materials for each stockholder sharing your address in the future, you may also contact American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company by phone at 1-800-627-7020 or by mail to 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219.

 
Solicitation of Proxies
 

All costs related to the solicitation of proxies, including the printing and mailing of this proxy statement, will be borne by us. We
have retained Morrow Sodali to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify records relating to the solicitation. Morrow Sodali will
receive a fee for its services of $15,000 in addition to an expense reimbursement. In addition, our directors, officers and employees
may, without additional compensation, solicit proxies from stockholders by mail, telephone, facsimile, or in person. However, you
should be aware that certain members of the Omega Board and our officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, yours. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
 

We will also reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in sending these materials to you
and getting your voting instructions.
 
Adjournment
 

The special meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the chairman of the meeting or by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the shares of Common Stock, present in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon, without further
notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting. At the adjourned meeting, Omega may transact any business that
might have been transacted at the original meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if a quorum is present at the
special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal, then the chairman
of the meeting has the power to adjourn the meeting, or, alternatively, Omega’s stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to
adjourn the special meeting in order to permit the further solicitation of proxies.
 
Stock Certificates
 

Stockholders should not send stock certificates with their proxies. A Letter of Transmittal (as defined in the merger agreement and
below under “The Merger Agreement—Payment of the Merger Consideration”) with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates
or book-entry shares, as applicable, will be mailed to our stockholders as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

THE MERGER
 
Description of the Merger
 

The Omega Board adopted, approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the merger. If the stockholders of Omega vote “FOR” the merger proposal, then, subject to other closing conditions as
described in “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger,” Merger Sub will be merged with and into Omega,
with Omega as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooke. We strongly encourage you to read
carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement, because it is the contract
that governs the merger.
 

If the merger is completed, each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest.
 

After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the merger consideration but you will no longer have any rights
as a stockholder of Omega. You will receive the merger consideration for your shares of Common Stock after exchanging your stock
certificates or book-entry shares, as applicable, and delivering the letter of transmittal to be sent to you shortly after completion of the
merger, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto. Further, holders of Omega Options will, upon
delivery of a duly executed option surrender agreement, be entitled to the option consideration, and the Omega Option so surrendered
will then be canceled.
 

The Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is designated for trading on the NYSE under the symbol
“OME.” Following the merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and will no longer be publicly traded, and the
registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.
 

Please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement” for additional and more detailed information regarding the merger
agreement.
 
Background of the Merger
 

The merger and the terms of the merger agreement are the result of arm’s length negotiations conducted between representatives
of Omega, Cooke and their respective legal and financial advisors. The following is a summary of the principal events, meetings,
negotiations and actions among the parties leading up to the execution and public announcement of the merger agreement.
 

2015-2016 Initial Strategic Review
 

During the summer of 2015, the Omega Board held regular monthly meetings to receive financial updates from Omega’s
management and to evaluate and discuss Omega’s business operations and strategy. During such meetings, the Omega Board
discussed, among other things, Omega’s business profile and value proposition, sector and industry developments, long-term forecasts
and recent events, including activist shareholders’ ownership of Omega.
 

In August 2015, the Omega Board initiated a review of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value (the “Initial Strategic
Review”), including continuing the current business strategy and pursuing growth opportunities, a share repurchase program, a sale,
spin-off, or other separation of a selected business or businesses, a merger or other form of business combination involving the entire
company, or a strategic acquisition. During the Initial Strategic Review, the Omega Board held monthly or bimonthly special meetings
to discuss the status of various elements of the Initial Strategic Review. On September 25, 2015, the Omega Board announced in a
press release it had engaged J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor and directed J.P. Morgan to discuss various potential transactions with
third parties to determine interest in a transaction, including a potential business combination. At the direction of the Omega Board,
representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted, or in some cases were contacted by, approximately 35 parties interested in a potential
business combination. Of those parties, 20 signed confidentiality agreements with Omega and thereafter, at the direction of the Omega
Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided such parties with access to additional diligence materials prepared by Omega to assist
in their evaluation of potential transactions. Each of the  signed confidentiality agreements included standstill provisions (including
“don’t ask, don’t waive” restrictions) ranging from one to two years.  Three of the parties to whom information was provided
submitted preliminary indications of interest for an acquisition or business combination with Omega (the “initial bidders”) with
implied equity values from $16.54 per share up to a range of $21 to $23 per share. From November 2015 through May 2016,
representatives of J.P. Morgan, Mr. Scholtes, President and Chief Executive Officer of Omega, and other members of Omega
management, engaged in discussions with the potential bidders concerning a potential transaction and granted access to Omega’s
facilities and a data room to the two initial bidders with proposals Omega management considered sufficiently attractive to merit
further consideration based on the equity value implied by such proposals. In addition, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1053650/000143774917019780/ome20171121_defm14a.htm 41/203

of the Omega Board, continued to contact potential interested third parties and respond to requests regarding Omega and the Initial
Strategic Review.

Table of Contents
 

In January 2016, at a special meeting of the Omega Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Scholtes expressed concern
about the ability and continued interest of the first of the two initial bidders to follow through on a potential transaction, citing such
bidder’s refusal to increase its price, its failure to obtain approval of its investment committee, the limited due diligence conducted by
such bidder, the addition of a financing condition and other indications that it would decrease the previously offered purchase price
range of $21-23.
 

In March 2016, the second of the two active initial bidders informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that it would not be able to
proceed with its offer of $22 per share, based in part on the results of its diligence and on its inability to obtain financing on acceptable
terms, and offered to proceed with a $16 per share offer. During March and April 2016, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction
of the Omega Board, and Omega management continued to discuss a potential transaction with both of the initial bidders, in part based
on the first initial bidder having expressed renewed interest in a possible acquisition at $19 per share subject to financing and to
satisfactory conclusion of additional diligence. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Omega Board, informed the first
initial bidder that the Omega Board would reject an offer of $19 per share but would continue discussions at $22 per share or higher.
In response, the first initial bidder revised its indication of interest to a possible acquisition at $20 per share. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Mr. Scholtes continued to express concern, however, regarding the ability of the first initial bidder to follow through on a
potential transaction for the reasons cited to the Omega Board in January 2016.
 

At a meeting in May 2016, after careful consideration and consultation with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Omega
management, the Omega Board determined that the various transactions considered during the Initial Strategic Review were not
sufficiently attractive to merit further consideration and authorized a share repurchase program of up to $40 million. On May 4, 2016,
Omega announced in a press release the completion of the Initial Strategic Review and the Omega Board’s decision to authorize a
share repurchase program.
 

2017 Review of Human Nutrition Business and the Merger
 

Following the completion of the Initial Strategic Review, between June 2016 and February 2017, Omega’s management continued
to communicate regularly with the Omega Board regarding Omega’s business, strategic plan and recent developments.
 

In August 2016, Gary R. Goodwin, the chairman of the Omega Board, formed an ad hoc “Human Nutrition Task Force”
comprised of Mr. Scholtes and Stephen C. Bryan, Michael N. Christodolou and David W. Wehlmann, each a member of the Omega
Board, to conduct internal and market research, analyze the cost structure and other financial information relating to Omega’s human
nutrition business and report to the Omega Board on strategic alternatives for the human nutrition business to best enhance shareholder
value for Omega. The ad hoc Human Nutrition Task Force reviewed the following three general courses of action: maintaining,
restructuring and divesting of the human nutrition business. In late September 2016, the ad hoc Human Nutrition Task Force presented
its findings to the Omega Board and the Omega Board determined to continue its discussion of strategic alternatives for the human
nutrition business, with a view to considering a more formal strategic review.
 

On February 22, 2017, Omega announced in a press release that the Omega Board had initiated a strategic alternatives review for
its human nutrition business as well as an evaluation of its current operating plan (“2017 Strategic Review”). In connection with the
2017 Strategic Review, Omega engaged J.P. Morgan as financial advisor for the potential disposition of Bioriginal Food & Science
and Cyvex, and BMO Capital Markets Corp. (“BMO”) as financial advisor for the potential disposition of WSP. In late February and
early March 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan and BMO, at the direction of the Omega Board, distributed information memoranda
regarding the human nutrition business to potential buyers.
 

During the first week of April 2017, one of the companies that had been approached regarding the 2017 Strategic Review
(“Potential Buyer B”) contacted Mr. Scholtes telephonically to express interest in exploring a transaction involving all of Omega’s
businesses. Potential Buyer B did not make any written proposal following these discussions or propose a purchase price for the
transaction.

Table of Contents
 

On April 7, 2017, Mr. Scholtes met with some members of management of Cooke, who were all in Washington, D.C. for business
unrelated to the 2017 Strategic Review. Cooke has been a customer of Omega since 2009, when Omega began selling animal nutrition
products to Cooke. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to Cooke accounted for less than one percent of Omega’s animal
nutrition revenue. At the April 7 meeting, Mr. Scholtes and the Cooke representatives discussed generally their business relationship
and their respective businesses and strategies.
 

On April 10, 2017, Glenn B. Cooke, the Chief Executive Officer of Cooke, called Mr. Scholtes and raised the possibility of a
business combination involving Cooke and Omega. After the call, Mr. Scholtes informed Mr. Goodwin of the call from Mr. Cooke and
Mr. Goodwin encouraged Mr. Scholtes to continue conversations with Cooke as well as Potential Buyer B. Later that week Mr.
Scholtes and Monty C. Deihl, Vice President of Operations of Omega, had dinner with Mr. Cooke in New York and the next day Mr.
Scholtes, Mr. Deihl and Mr. Cooke toured certain of Omega’s facilities.
 

Also during that week, Potential Buyer B and Omega entered into a confidentiality agreement in connection with a potential
transaction and Omega began to provide Potential Buyer B with access to diligence materials for Potential Buyer B to further evaluate
a potential transaction. The confidentiality agreement with Buyer B included a standstill provision that provided for its automatic
termination upon the announcement of the signing of a merger or similar transaction involving Omega. On April 13, 2017, Mr.
Scholtes and Andrew C. Johannesen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Omega, traveled to New Orleans,
Louisiana and had an introductory dinner with Potential Buyer B’s Chief Executive Officer and its Vice President of Strategy and
Corporate Development. They discussed generally a potential transaction between Omega and Potential Buyer B as well as the
respective businesses of Omega and Potential Buyer B. During the next week, Mr. Scholtes, Mr. Johannesen and John D. Held,
Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Omega, met with Potential Buyer B’s management team to present a
review of Omega’s business and further discuss a potential transaction. Also during that week, Cooke and Omega entered into a
confidentiality agreement in connection with a potential transaction.
 

On April 28, 2017, Mr. Scholtes received a letter and telephone call from Mr. Cooke expressing Cooke’s interest, based on its
preliminary analysis and subject to satisfactory completion of its diligence, in acquiring Omega for total consideration of $540 million
or $24 per share, which represented an approximate 23% premium over the 20-day average trading price as of April 28, 2017. Cooke’s
letter also requested a 60-day exclusivity period. Mr. Scholtes forwarded the letter to the Omega Board and suggested that a special
meeting of the Omega Board be held to evaluate the inbound indications of interest from Potential Buyer B and Cooke.
 

The next day, the Omega Board met telephonically with Mr. Held and Mr. Johannesen participating to discuss the Cooke proposal
and the interest expressed by Potential Buyer B. At the meeting, Mr. Scholtes provided a summary of the communications and
answered questions from the board members. The board discussed the proposal, Omega’s business and prospects and process
considerations for evaluating a potential transaction. At that meeting the Omega Board authorized the engagement of J.P. Morgan as
its financial advisor and V&E as its legal advisor to assist with negotiating and evaluating any potential transaction. The Omega
Board’s decision to engage J.P. Morgan was based on, among other things, J.P. Morgan’s familiarity with Omega, its experience,
including in connection with the Initial Strategic Review, and its reputation, generally. Prior to engaging J.P. Morgan, the Omega
Board also evaluated potential conflicts of interests that J.P. Morgan might have with the most likely parties to any merger or business
combination with Omega.  J.P. Morgan has informed Omega that neither it nor its affiliates has ever had any material commercial or
investment banking relationships with Cooke. Pursuant to the engagement letter between Omega and J.P. Morgan, Omega agreed to
pay J.P. Morgan a fee of $2.0 million at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its fairness opinion and an additional fee of approximately $5.5
million upon the closing of the merger. Omega also agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee in the event that Omega receives a break-up fee in
connection with the termination, or abandonment of the merger, or failure of the merger to occur.  In addition, Omega agreed to
reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and
will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. Prior to approving the fee arrangement
in the engagement letter, the Omega Board considered the amounts of the fees paid by companies to financial advisors in connection
with similar type engagements and transactions.
 

The Omega Board next met on May 5, 2017, at the Omega offices in Houston, Texas with Mr. Held, Mr. Johannesen, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and V&E in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Scholtes and representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an
update on the status of the 2017 Strategic Review related to Omega’s human nutrition business. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the
direction of the Omega Board, had contacted 136 potential buyers and Omega had entered into 72 confidentiality agreements with
potential buyers for the disposition of Bioriginal Food & Science and Cyvex, which resulted in the receipt of 12 preliminary offers.
BMO had contacted 197 potential buyers and Omega had entered into 87 confidentiality agreements with potential buyers for the
disposition of WSP. Preliminary offers for the WSP business were due the following week. None of the confidentiality agreements
entered into in connection with the 2017 Strategic Review related to Omega’s human nutrition business included any standstill
provisions. Following the discussion of the human nutrition business, Mr. Scholtes provided an update on the discussions with Cooke
and Potential Buyer B. Topics discussed included additional information needed by the Omega Board and its advisors to evaluate the
potential transactions, the proposed purchase price offered by Cooke and its relation to the short term and long term projections and

forecasts of management, and timing considerations. The Omega Board authorized management to continue discussions with Cooke
and Potential Buyer B but after discussion of Cooke’s request, determined that exclusivity should not be granted to Cooke at such
time, citing the potential interest of other buyers, including Potential Buyer B. The Omega Board discussed whether to direct Omega
management or J.P. Morgan to approach other potential buyers, including those that had expressed interest in connection with the
Initial Strategic Review. However, the Board determined that a thorough process had already been conducted through the Initial
Strategic Review and that such additional contacts after such a brief intervening period were unlikely to yield any proposals that
would be sufficiently attractive to merit consideration. Representatives of V&E provided an overview to the Omega Board regarding
the Omega Board’s fiduciary duties in considering proposals by potential buyers and reviewed certain terms and legal aspects of the
Cooke proposal.  The Omega Board discussed potential conflicts of interest in light of such fiduciary duties and determined that there
were no potential conflicts preventing any members of the Omega Board from complying with their fiduciary duties in connection
with the approval of a merger or similar transaction involving Omega.

On May 8, 2017, Omega announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, including a 13% decrease in
Omega’s revenues from the same period in the last year, and noted that recent global fish quota announcements were likely to put
pressure on fish meal and fish oil pricing in the second half of 2017.
 

On May 11, 2017, the Omega Board, Mr. Johannesen, Mr. Held and representatives of V&E and J.P. Morgan held a telephonic
meeting to review the continuing discussions with Potential Buyer B and the proposal that Omega had received from Cooke. The
Omega Board approved Cooke’s request to retain Kelley, Drye & Warren LLP (“KDW”) as its legal counsel, a law firm that Omega
had historically utilized in connection with fisheries regulatory matters. The Omega Board also decided to schedule a weekly update
call on the status of efforts to divest the human nutrition businesses and the potential business combination with Potential Buyer B and
Cooke.
 

In the Omega Board’s update call on May 16, 2017, Mr. Scholtes informed the Omega Board that Potential Buyer B had not yet
presented a more definitive proposal for a potential transaction and had communicated concerns about the strategic rationale for the
potential transaction. Mr. Scholtes also noted that he continued to press Cooke management to increase the offered $24 per share
purchase price. To permit continued dialogue with Potential Buyer B, the Omega Board again rejected Cooke’s request for an
exclusivity agreement.
 

On May 21, 2017, the Omega Board held a telephonic meeting with Mr. Johannesen, Mr. Held and representatives of V&E and
J.P. Morgan participating to review the status of Omega’s ongoing 2017 Strategic Review process and the ongoing discussions with
Cooke and Potential Buyer B. The Omega Board discussed Cooke’s recent demand for a 60-day exclusivity period as a condition to
continuing discussions. After a review of the factors supporting such an extension, including the lack of a definitive proposal from
Buyer B and Cooke’s refusal to proceed with discussions absent such an exclusivity period, the Omega Board approved granting a
limited 28-day exclusivity period to Cooke during which Omega would be restricted from initiating, encouraging or facilitating an
alternative transaction, with an exception permitting unsolicited offers, and subject to an expense reimbursement to Cooke of up to
$1,300,000 if Omega entered into a definitive binding agreement in connection with such an unsolicited offer within a certain period
of time. In addition, the exclusivity agreement provided for a nine day extension to the 28-day exclusivity period if prior to the
expiration of such period, Cooke provided notice to Omega reaffirming the $24 per share purchase price. Omega and Cooke entered
into an exclusivity letter agreement on the terms approved by the Omega Board on May 21, 2017.
 

On May 22, 2017, Mr. Scholtes received an unsolicited telephone call from an additional interested party (“Potential Buyer C”)
regarding a potential acquisition of Omega. Potential Buyer C communicated its interest at that time, but did not indicate any material
terms of the transaction. Mr. Scholtes informed the Omega Board of his call with Potential Buyer C.
 

Over the course of the next several weeks, Omega shared materials responsive to Cooke’s diligence request with Cooke and its
advisors and at the end of May 2017, members of the Omega management team met with Cooke in Suffolk, Virginia for diligence
discussions.
 

On June 8, 2017, the Omega Board met telephonically with Mr. Johannesen, Mr. Held and representatives of V&E and J.P.
Morgan participating to discuss the status of the potential transaction, including Cooke’s diligence review of Omega and management
meetings in connection therewith. During the meeting, Mr. Scholtes also summarized recent calls from Potential Buyer B and Potential
Buyer C, noting that Potential Buyer B never formalized its offer and appeared uninterested in further pursuing a transaction. The
Omega Board noted that the interest of these parties could be addressed at a later date, either after the current exclusivity period ended
or under certain circumstances if a definitive agreement was entered into with Cooke. On June 8, 2017, the Omega Board also
received presentations from representatives of BMO and J.P. Morgan regarding the human nutrition sales process. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan updated that seven of the 12 initial bidders submitted second round offers for the acquisition of Bioriginal Food & Science
and Cyvex and provided overviews of such offers. BMO summarized the six indications of interest for the acquisition of WSP that
were received by the deadline on May 10, 2017. The Omega Board expressed its continued interest in evaluating potential sale
transactions for the human nutrition business.

In mid-June, V&E delivered a draft merger agreement to Cooke and its counsel, KDW, which included among other things a
provision allowing Omega to solicit alternative acquisition proposals for a limited period following the signing of the merger
agreement. On June 19, 2017, Cooke provided notice to Omega reaffirming its proposed purchase price of $24 a share, thereby
extending its exclusivity period by nine days to June 28, 2017 pursuant to the exclusivity agreement. A few days later, KDW delivered
a revised draft merger agreement to V&E and Omega together with a memorandum outlining key issues and changes from the draft
prepared by V&E. The revised proposal from Cooke reduced the proposed purchase price to $22 per share, revised the transaction
structure to provide for the transfer of certain assets, including vessels and planes and related employees, to a qualifying U.S. citizen
that is not an affiliate of Cooke in order to allow the vessels to maintain their U.S. fishing certificates required by the Merchant Marine
Act of 1920 (the “Jones Act”). The Cooke merger agreement also proposed to prohibit Omega from soliciting alternative proposals but
allowing Omega to consider unsolicited acquisition proposals following the signing of the merger agreement if certain conditions were
met, including giving Cooke the right to match any such acquisition proposal as well as a $25 million termination fee payable by
Omega.
 

On June 28, 2017, Gary Goodwin, Chairman of the Omega Board, and Mr. Cooke spoke by telephone during which Mr. Cooke
reiterated Cooke’s interest in acquiring Omega, explained that the decreased price of $22 per share was a result of Cooke’s view of the
value of the business based on its diligence as well as their increased transaction costs. The price of $22 per share represented an
approximate 25% premium over the 20-day average trading price as of June 28, 2017. Mr. Cooke assured Mr. Goodwin that financing
of the transaction would not be a condition to closing and that Cooke would soon have committed financing in place. Mr. Goodwin
communicated to Mr. Cooke that, while they were prepared to proceed for the time being, the Omega Board expected any agreed to
transaction would be at least at the originally proposed $24 per share.
 

On June 29, 2017, at a regularly scheduled, in-person meeting of the Omega Board following the annual stockholders meeting in
Houston, Texas, Omega management reviewed Omega’s long-range business plan and forecast with the Omega Board which had been
prepared by management as part of its regular business practices. Management described, among other recent developments and
trends, a forecasted decline in fish catch and yields in Omega’s current fishing season, and the expected global downward pressure on
fish meal and fish oil pricing. A representative of V&E reviewed for the Omega Board a summary of the terms and differences
between the draft merger agreement that Omega sent to Cooke and the agreement proposed by Cooke and discussed various risk
associated with the agreement as proposed by Cooke, as well as possible responses. The Omega Board discussed and asked questions
regarding the risks and benefits of the proposed transaction as well as the proposed valuation. The Omega Board continued to discuss
next steps with Cooke and other potential purchasers. The consensus of the Omega Board following their discussion was that
management should clearly communicate to Cooke that the Omega Board was not willing at this time to approve a transaction at less
than $24 per share and that management should continue to work with Omega’s financial and legal advisors with the goal of
continuing to develop and improve upon the proposal from Cooke, as well as evaluating other possible alternatives. In addition,
representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an update on the human nutrition business sale process, noting that Omega and representatives
of J.P. Morgan were in discussions with four potential purchasers for the Bioriginal Food & Science and Cyvex businesses at a
proposed valuation range of approximately $75-100 million and Omega and BMO were in discussions with three financial potential
purchasers for the WSP business at a proposed valuation range of approximately $10-20 million. Also on June 29, 2017, the
compensation committee of the Omega Board met and discussed the effects of a potential purchase of Omega on Omega’s employees,
benefits plans and employment and severance arrangements, and received advice from a representative from Frederic W. Cook & Co.,
Inc., the committee’s executive compensation advisor.
 

During the first week of July 2017, Omega and V&E delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to Cooke and its counsel,
KDW. This draft of the merger agreement accepted Cooke’s proposal to include a no solicitation provision that only allowed Omega to
consider unsolicited acquisition proposals following the signing of the merger agreement and would give Cooke the right to match any
such acquisition proposal but rejected the proposed $22 per share of Common Stock merger consideration and in addition proposed a
reverse termination fee in an amount equal to the termination fee payable by Cooke in the event that required regulatory approvals
were not obtained.

On July 13, 2017, the Omega Board held a telephonic meeting with Mr. Johannesen, Mr. Held and representatives of V&E and
J.P. Morgan participating to discuss an update on the status of Omega’s discussions with Cooke. A representative from V&E
summarized the MARAD Approval requirements for foreign purchasers of U.S. fishing vessels and how those MARAD Approval
requirements may affect the proposed transaction, including Cooke’s demand to request confirmation from MARAD prior to
executing a definitive merger agreement. A representative from V&E summarized the key terms of the draft merger agreement that
Omega distributed to Cooke, as well as the manner in which certain key unresolved issues were addressed in the revised agreement.
 

On July 14, 2017, K&L Gates LLP, maritime counsel to Cooke, submitted a letter on behalf of Cooke to MARAD requesting
confirmation by July 28, 2017 that upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the MARAD
Sale Agreement, the applicable fishing vessels would continue to be eligible for documentation with a fishery endorsement required
by the Jones Act.
 

At the Omega Board’s status update call on July 20, 2017, Omega management and representatives from V&E updated the
Omega Board on the status of various open issues. After deliberation, the Omega Board instructed Mr. Scholtes and Mr. Goodwin to
continue to press for Cooke to increase the $22 per share proposed purchase price. During the call representatives of J.P. Morgan
presented an update on the status of the human nutrition sales process, noting that discussions were ongoing with three bidders for the
Bioriginal Food & Science and Cyvex businesses. Mr. Scholtes updated the Omega Board that one proposal for the WSP business
remained that Omega management considered sufficiently attractive to merit further consideration.
 

On July 24, 2017, following the expiration of the exclusivity period, Mr. Scholtes and Mr. Goodwin met with Potential Buyer C in
person to discuss a potential transaction and requested a formal indication of interest. Potential Buyer C did not deliver a formalized
offer or indicate a proposed purchase price to Omega following the meeting. During the first week of August 2017, Mr. Held and
Potential Buyer C’s General Counsel and outside counsel negotiated the terms of the confidentiality agreement to the point where it
was completed on August 4, 2017, at which time Mr. Held transmitted a copy of such agreement signed by Omega to Potential Buyer
C. Potential Buyer C never responded to subsequent requests for status updates and never returned an executed confidentiality
agreement. Accordingly, Omega never shared any confidential information with Potential Buyer C or engaged in any further
substantive discussions.
 

On August 10, 2017, the Omega Board held a telephonic meeting with Mr. Johannesen, Mr. Held and representatives of V&E and
J.P. Morgan participating. During that meeting the Omega Board discussed the potential transaction with Cooke, including the
proposed $22 per share purchase price relative to the current, historical and potential future Omega stock prices as well as Omega’s
current projections, the current financial performance and position of Omega, future financial and operating forecasts, and other
strategic alternatives. Mr. Held and Mr. Johannesen were excused from the meeting. Based on the discussion and preliminary
information presented by representatives of J.P. Morgan, the Omega Board determined that the potential transaction could be viewed
as attractive at $22 per share, but that the Omega Board would instruct management to continue to negotiate for a higher purchase
price. The Omega Board also discussed strategic considerations related to the ongoing review process of the human nutrition business,
including whether to continue the process in parallel with negotiations with Cooke or to include the human nutrition business in a
business combination with Cooke. Management updated the Omega Board on the status of the financing efforts of Cooke, including
the role of BMO as a potential financing source. The Omega Board considered the potential conflicts and risks presented by BMO’s
role as a financing source for Cooke in connection with the proposed transaction and concluded that, by virtue of the limitations on the
use of Omega’s confidential information agreed to in Omega’s engagement letter with BMO regarding the potential disposition of
WSP, it would not to object to BMO’s role as a financing source for Cooke. The compensation committee of the Omega Board
reported that they had discussed various management compensation and related issues that might arise in connection with a potential
transaction, as well as certain employee matters that were subject to negotiation in the draft merger agreement. The compensation
committee of the Omega Board further reported, based in part on management’s recommendation, that the existing executive
employment agreements should be harmonized so that those without a constructive termination provision be amended to include a
customary constructive termination provision in connection with entering into any definitive agreement relating to a merger or
business combination of Omega. The compensation committee determined that it was in Omega’s best interests to approve such
amendments because Omega would need a mechanism to retain key executives during the time between announcement of a
transaction and closing.
 

On August 15, 2017, Mr. Held, Mr. Johannesen, representatives of Cooke, KDW, V&E and J.P. Morgan had an in-person meeting
at V&E’s offices in Houston, Texas to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction, including the merger agreement, as well as open
diligence issues, Cooke’s financing plan and the ongoing review process for the human nutrition business. At the meeting, Mr. Held
and Mr. Johannesen reiterated that the $22 per share offer would need to be increased.
 

At its regularly scheduled update call on August 17, 2017, Mr. Held, Mr. Johannesen and representatives of V&E and J.P. Morgan
updated the Omega Board on the results of the August 15, 2017 in-person meeting with Cooke and KDW. The Omega Board used the
opportunity to discuss and ask questions regarding Cooke’s financing efforts and the status of such efforts, the process and risks

surrounding MARAD Approval and certain of the material terms of the merger agreement. The Omega Board reiterated to
management that it had not determined whether the $22 per share offer was sufficient and instructed management to continue to
negotiate for a higher purchase price.

On August 28, Mr. Scholtes met with Mr. Cooke and Mr. Leonard Stewart, Executive Vice President of Cooke, at Cooke Seafood
USA, Inc.’s offices in Suffolk, Virginia, to discuss outstanding issues in the merger agreement. Mr. Scholtes stressed to Mr. Cooke and
Mr. Stewart that the Omega Board had not indicated that the $22 per share offer would be accepted and that a potential transaction
would be more attractive to the Omega Board at a higher purchase price.  
 

On September 7, 2017 the Omega Board held a telephonic meeting. Mr. Johannesen, Mr. Held and representatives of V&E and
J.P. Morgan participated in the meeting. Management updated the Omega Board on the status and open issues remaining in the merger
agreement and ancillary documents, analysis of regulatory approvals and consents and of the pending response from MARAD to the
confirmation request submitted on July 14, 2017. The Omega Board also discussed Mr. Held’s, Mr. Scholtes’ and Mr. Johannesen’s
recent conversation with the BMO team that was assisting with the financing for Cooke, and the perspective of representatives of J.P.
Morgan’s on Cooke’s committed financing. The Omega Board reiterated its instruction to management to continue to negotiate for a
higher purchase price and to not indicate any acceptance of the $22 per share offer. A representative from V&E reviewed the draft of
the merger agreement, highlighting the material open issues.
 

From September 11, 2017 to September 29, 2017, KDW and V&E, on behalf of their respective clients discussed, negotiated and
revised the merger agreement and ancillary agreements by telephone and electronic communication. During this period, Omega also
provided additional diligence information and drafts of certain of the disclosure schedules under the merger agreement to Cooke or its
representatives.
 

On September 24 and 25, 2017, the Omega Board held its regularly scheduled, in-person quarterly meeting at which Omega
management participated. The Omega Board discussed the human nutrition business and strategic paths to drive shareholder value.
Mr. Scholtes noted that one bidder remained under consideration in each sales process, but each was subject to financing risks and
other uncertainties to closing and lower than originally proposed purchase prices. The Omega Board determined to continue
discussions with potential buyers, but that the human nutrition sales process should not delay a potential transaction with Cooke.
Omega management, except for Mr. Scholtes and Mr. Held, were excused from the meeting and a representative from V&E joined the
meeting to review and answer questions regarding the remaining open material items in the draft merger agreement, MARAD Sale
Agreement and other ancillary documents. After responding to the board members questions, the V&E representative and Mr. Held
were excused from the meeting and the Omega Board continued to discuss the benefits and risks of the proposed Cooke merger
transaction compared to Omega’s existing business plan or other potential transactions until its adjournment for the evening. Upon the
Omega Board’s reconvening the next morning, they continued to discuss the various options and how best to create or enhance
stockholder value. After the discussion, the Omega Board reached a consensus on its desired response to Cooke’s latest proposal and
asked Mr. Goodwin to instruct V&E to prepare and deliver a letter to KDW outlining the board’s counter proposal with respect to each
of the open material items and proposing merger consideration of $23.25 per share of Common Stock. The Omega Board also
evaluated how to bring the discussion to a conclusion and its alternatives if the parties could not agree on material open terms.
Following the meeting, Mr. Goodwin requested V&E prepare a letter for KDW on the terms determined by the Omega Board and on
September 27, 2017, V&E delivered such letter by email to KDW.
 

On September 29, 2017, K&L Gates LLP received preliminary confirmation from MARAD that, in response to its letter dated
July 14, 2017, and subsequent correspondence, upon consummation of the transactions described in such letter and correspondence
(including the merger and the transactions contemplated by the MARAD Sale Agreement), the applicable fishing vessels would
continue to be eligible for documentation with a fishery endorsement required under the Jones Act. Also on September 29, 2017,
representatives from KDW and V&E discussed by phone the open issues in the transaction documents summarized by V&E in its
September 27, 2017 letter.
 

On October 2, 2017, V&E delivered a revised draft merger agreement and draft MARAD Sale Agreement to KDW and Cooke.
Later that evening, KDW delivered a further revised draft merger agreement to V&E and Omega together with an email outlining their
proposal with respect to each of the open business issues. In its revised draft, Cooke agreed to Omega’s proposal that both the reverse
termination fee payable by Cooke and the termination fee payable by Omega would be $20 million. Cooke reiterated its offer of $22
per share of Common Stock and did not respond in the revised draft to Omega’s proposal to increase the merger consideration to
$23.25 per share of Common Stock.

On October 3, 2017 and October 4, 2017, management of Cooke and Omega and their respective counsel discussed the remaining
open issues and exchanged revised drafts of the documents. That afternoon, Omega distributed near final versions of agreements, as
well as a summary of the terms of the transaction and open points to the Omega Board for their review and consideration. Also on
October 4, 2017, Mr. Goodwin called Mr. Cooke and again requested that Cooke increase its offer above $22 indicating that he was
unsure if the Omega Board would approve a transaction at that price level. Mr. Cooke, citing Omega’s declining 2017 operating results
and market prices for fish meal and fish oil as compared to results and market prices in the prior year, as well as increased financing
costs, said that $22 was the highest price Cooke would pay and it would not increase its offer.
 

On the morning of October 5, 2017, the Omega Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the outcome of negotiations with
Cooke and the terms of the proposed transaction. A representative of Holland & Hart LLP, Nevada counsel to Omega, reviewed with
the Omega Board their fiduciary duties in connection with the consideration of the proposed transaction with Cooke. Representatives
of V&E described, and the Omega Board discussed, the terms of the final merger agreement, MARAD Sale Agreement, financing
documents and ancillary agreements, each of which had been distributed to the Omega Board prior to the meeting. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Omega Board its financial analysis of the merger consideration provided for in the merger
agreement and delivered to the Omega Board its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 5,
2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of
Common Stock in the proposed merger, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described below in
the section “Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration” beginning on page 38 of this proxy
statement.

 
Following discussion, and after considering the foregoing and the interests of the members of the Omega Board and management

in the potential transaction that are described in “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger,”
including the factors described under “Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of The Omega Board,” the Omega Board
unanimously adopted resolutions (i) adopting, approving, declaring advisable and authorizing the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, (ii) directing that the merger be submitted to the stockholders of Omega for
approval at a meeting of such stockholders and (iii) recommending that stockholders of Omega approve the merger and the merger
agreement, compensation that may or will become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger and all other
actions or matters necessary or advisable to give effect to the merger and merger agreement pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes.
 

After the Omega Board meeting concluded, Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Scholtes called Mr. Cooke and told him that the Omega Board
had approved the proposed transaction under the terms set out in the merger agreement and related agreements, including the $22 price
subject to Cooke’s providing evidence of committed financing sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration and expenses of
the transaction. Late that evening, Omega, Cooke and Merger Sub executed and delivered to each other the definitive merger
agreement, VesselCo Holdings and Omega executed and delivered the definitive MARAD Sale Agreement and Cooke provided copies
of executed financing commitments and credit facilities. On October 6, 2017, Omega and Cooke issued a joint press release
announcing the transaction.  As noted above, upon announcement of the transaction with Cooke, the standstill provisions in the
confidentiality agreement with Buyer B automatically terminated.  In addition, the standstill provisions in all but three of the 20
confidentiality agreements entered into in connection with the Initial Strategic Review, including those of the initial bidders in the
Initial Strategic Review, have expired and are no longer in effect. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of the parties to the three
confidentiality agreements with standstill provisions still in effect has ever made any proposal related to a business combination or
other transaction.

 
In August 2015, Wynnefield Capital Management, LLC (“Wynnefield Capital”) first publicly disclosed through a Schedule 13D

filing that it owned beneficially more than 5% of Omega’s outstanding common stock.  In August 2016, Wynnefield Capital filed an
amendment to its Schedule 13D disclosing that it had ceased be a beneficial owner of 5% or more of Omega’s outstanding common
stock.  The Omega Board and its members did not have any communications with representatives of Wynnefield Capital regarding any
transactions being considered as part of the Initial Strategic Review or the 2017 Strategic Review or in connection with its evaluation
and negotiation of the transaction with Cooke.  
 
Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of The Omega Board
 

At a meeting of the Omega Board held on October 5, 2017, the Omega Board approved, adopted, declared advisable and
authorized in all respects the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. The Omega Board
unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Omega vote “FOR” the approval and adoption of the merger, the merger
agreement and all other actions or matters necessary or desirable to give effect to the foregoing pursuant to the NRS.

Table of Contents
 

In the course of reaching its decision, the Omega Board consulted with our senior management and our financial and legal
advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors, including, among others:
 

 
● Merger Consideration. The Omega Board considered the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration.

Specifically, the Omega Board considered:
 

 
● the fact that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration represented a 32.9% premium to $16.55, the

closing price of the Common Stock on October 4, 2017, the last trading day prior to the approval of the merger by the
Omega Board;

 

 
● the belief of the Omega Board that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration was the highest price

per share that Cooke was willing to agree to pay, and the views of our board of directors as to the likelihood that any
third party would be willing to pay more to acquire Omega on the same or substantially similar terms;

 

 
● the fact that the $22.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration represents a premium of approximately

33.3% to the volume-weighted average trading price of $16.51 for the 90-day period ended October 4, 2017; and
 

 
● the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, without a financing contingency, which compared to

non-cash consideration, provides certainty and immediate liquidity and value to our stockholders, in each case upon and
assuming closing of the merger.

 

 

● Omega’s current condition and future prospects. The Omega Board considered information with respect to our financial
condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and business strategy on a historical and prospective basis, as
well as current industry, economic and market conditions and trends. The Omega Board also considered the potential future
value of Omega, together with the risks associated with continued independence discussed above, as compared to the value of
the merger consideration.

 

 

● Possibility of more favorable bid. The Omega Board considered its assessment as to the possibility that a third party with the
financial means would agree to a transaction at a higher price than Cooke on similar or more favorable terms, given Omega’s
historical discussions with prospective counterparties and the nature of such discussions, as more fully described in “The
Merger—Background of the Merger.”

 

 

● Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor. The Omega Board considered the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan, which was confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion dated October 5, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described below under the caption “Opinion of Omega’s
Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration” beginning on page 38 of this proxy statement. The full text of the
written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated October 5, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in rendering the opinion, is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement.

 

 

● Characteristics of Cooke. The Omega Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Cooke and its
management, Cooke’s experience executing acquisitions (including of U.S.-based businesses), Cooke’s commitment to its
growth strategy, the resources available to Cooke to complete the merger and the commercial incentives and motivations of
Cooke to timely obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and complete the merger. The Omega Board also considered the
culture and management of Cooke and that the merger would combine two highly-regarded, long-standing companies in the
global fishing and seafood industry with complementary cultures and traditions of operating in small, coastal towns.

 

 
● Financing. The Omega Board considered the terms of the Financing Facility provided to Cooke in connection with the

merger together with the financial capabilities and reputation of the financing sources.
 

 

● Likelihood of consummation. The Omega Board considered the likelihood that the merger would be completed in light of,
among other things, the conditions to the merger and the absence of a financing condition, the absence of any condition
related to the receipt of third party commercial consents or approvals, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory
approvals and the remedies available to us under the merger agreement in the event of various breaches by Cooke.

Table of Contents
 

 
● Cooke’s representation regarding financial resources. Cooke’s representation that it will have sufficient financial resources

to pay the merger consideration and consummate the merger, and the remedies available to us under the merger agreement in
the event of various breaches by Cooke.

 
 ● Merger Agreement. The Omega Board considered the terms of the merger agreement, including:
 

 
● the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties to the merger agreement, the conditions to the parties’

obligations to complete the merger and their ability to terminate the merger agreement;
 

 

● Cooke’s undertakings in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the fact that the consummation of the
merger agreement is (i) conditioned on obtaining HSR and foreign anti-trust approval and MARAD Approval (on
October 30, 2017, U.S. antitrust authorities notified Omega and Cooke that early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act had been granted), as further described in “The Merger—Regulatory Matters” and (ii) not conditioned on
obtaining the consent of any third party under commercial agreements;

 
 ● the obligation of Cooke under certain circumstances to pay us a regulatory termination fee of $20 million;
 

 
● the right of Omega and its board of directors to respond to a competing proposal from any bidder, subject to certain

restrictions and the requirement that we pay Cooke a termination fee of $20 million if we terminate the merger
agreement pursuant to the Superior Proposal termination right;

 

 

● the belief of the Omega Board that, although the no solicitation covenant and termination fee provisions might have the
effect of discouraging competing third-party proposals or reducing the price of such proposals, such provisions are
customary for transactions of this size and type, and its belief that the $20 million termination fee, representing
approximately 4% of the equity value of the transaction, was reasonable in the context of comparable transactions,
particularly given the discussions with other potential bidders that we held in advance of the execution of the merger
agreement, as more fully described in “The Merger—Background of the Merger”; and

 

 
● the right of the Omega Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, subject to certain restrictions, in connection

with a superior proposal or other circumstances in which the Omega Board determines the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 

 
● Current economic and political conditions. The Omega Board considered the current state of the economy, debt financing

markets, political climate and general uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic and political conditions, both in the near
term and the long term, and both generally and within our industry.

 
In the course of reaching its decision, the Omega Board also considered a number of potentially negative factors including, among

others, the following:
 

 

● Risks associated with announcement and pendency of the Merger. The Omega Board considered the risk that the
announcement and pendency of the merger, including the restrictions on the conduct of our business, may cause substantial
harm to relationships with our employees, agents, customers and partners and may divert management and employee
attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business. The Omega Board also considered the possibility that the time
period between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger could be significant due to the expected
time necessary to obtain required regulatory approvals, which enhances those risks.

Table of Contents
 

 

● Risks associated with a failure to consummate the Merger. The Omega Board considered the fact that there can be no
assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the merger will be satisfied, and, as a result, the
possibility that necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied and that the merger might not be
completed, and further noted that these risks may be heightened due to the requirement of MARAD Approval. The Omega
Board noted the fact that, if the merger is not completed:

 

 
● we will have incurred significant risk and transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our

operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our
business and agent and customer relationships;

 

 
● no Regulatory Termination Fee would be payable by Cooke if certain regulatory approvals, other than HSR, foreign

antitrust or MARAD Approval, were not satisfied and certain other conditions have been satisfied or waived;
 

 
● depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of the Common

Stock would decline significantly; and
 
 ● the market’s perception of our prospects could be adversely affected.
 

 
● Financing risk. The Omega Board considered the risk that, while the merger agreement is not by its terms subject to a

financing condition, if Cooke fails to obtain sufficient financing, the merger may not be consummated.
 
 ● Merger Agreement. The Omega Board considered the terms of the merger agreement, including:
 

 
● the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us

from realizing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations we would otherwise
take absent the pending merger;

 
 ● provisions that preclude us from actively soliciting alternative proposals to the merger; and
 

 
● the requirement that, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including by Omega to accept a

Superior Proposal, Omega would be obligated to pay a $20 million termination fee to Cooke, which might have the
effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the price of such proposals.

 

 
● Tax treatment. The Omega Board considered the fact that an all cash transaction generally would be a taxable transaction to

Omega’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 

 
● Participation in future gains. The Omega Board considered the fact that Omega will no longer exist as an independent

public company and Omega’s stockholders will forgo any future increase in Omega’s value that might result from our
earnings or possible growth.

 

 
● Risk factors. The Omega Board considered other risks and uncertainties including those listed above in the section entitled

“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
 

While the Omega Board considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, the Omega Board concluded that,
overall, the potentially positive factors outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, the Omega Board unanimously
approved, adopted, declared advisable and authorized in all respects the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the merger.
 

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Omega Board in
its consideration of the merger, but is merely a summary of the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by
the Omega Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the Omega
Board did not find it practicable to make specific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. In addition, the Omega Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to
whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, and
individual members of the Omega Board may have given different weights to different factors. Based on the totality of the information
presented, the Omega Board collectively reached the unanimous decision to adopt, approve, declare advisable and authorize in all
respects the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in light of the factors described above
and other factors that the members of the Omega Board felt were appropriate.

When you consider the Omega Board’s recommendation, you should be aware that Omega’s directors may have interests in the
merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Omega’s stockholders generally. These interests are described in
the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
 

This explanation of Omega’s reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature
and, therefore, should be read in light of the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
 
Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration
 

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated May 18, 2017, Omega retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed merger.
 

At the meeting of the Omega Board on October 5, 2017, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Omega Board that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its October 5, 2017 oral opinion by
delivering its written opinion to the Omega Board, dated October 5, 2017, that, as of such date, the merger consideration to be paid to
the holders of Common Stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.
 

The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated October 5, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated
herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such opinion. Omega’s stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written
opinion was addressed to the Omega Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
proposed merger, was directed only to the merger consideration to be paid in the merger and did not address any other aspect of the
merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the merger consideration to the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of Omega or as to the underlying decision by Omega to engage in the proposed merger. The issuance
of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
any stockholder of Omega as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any other matter.
 

In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
 
 ● reviewed the merger agreement;
 
 ● reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Omega and the industries in which it

operates;
 

 ● compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies;
 

 ● compared the financial and operating performance of Omega with publicly available information concerning certain
other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of Common Stock
and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
 

 ● reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Omega relating to its business;
and

Table of Contents
 
 ● performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed

appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
 

In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Omega with respect to certain aspects of
the merger, and the past and current business operations of Omega, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of
Omega and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
 

In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Omega or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan, and J.P.
Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for independently verifying) any such information
or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or
liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Cooke or Omega under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan
assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by
management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Omega to which such analyses or forecasts
relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan
assumed that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as described in the
merger agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by Omega and Cooke in the merger
agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a
legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to Omega with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan
further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Omega or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.
 

The projections furnished to J.P. Morgan for Omega were prepared by Omega management. Omega does not publicly
disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the merger,
and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These projections were based on certain variables and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation, factors related
to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from
those set forth in such projections. J.P. Morgan did not consider or rely upon any projections prepared in connection with the potential
disposition of the WSP business or any projections prepared in connection with the potential disposition of the Bioriginal Food &
Science and Cyvex businesses.  For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please
refer to the section entitled “Unaudited Financial Projections of Omega” beginning on page 43 of this proxy statement.
 

J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect
J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s
opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Common
Stock in the proposed merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any
other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Omega or the underlying decision by Omega to engage in the merger.
Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or
employees of any party to the proposed merger, or any class of such persons relative to the merger consideration to be paid to the
holders of Common Stock in the proposed merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion as to the price at which Common Stock will trade at any future time.
 

The terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm’s length negotiations between Omega and Cooke, and the
decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Omega Board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were
only one of the many factors considered by the Omega Board in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as
determinative of the views of the Omega Board or Omega management with respect to the proposed merger or the merger
consideration.

In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology
in rendering its opinion to the Omega Board on October 5, 2017 and in the presentation delivered to the Omega Board on such date in
connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan
in connection with rendering its opinion to the Omega Board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables
are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be
read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
 

Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Omega with
similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the
business of Omega or aspects thereof.
 

The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
 
 ● Marine Harvest ASA
 ● Austevoll Seafood ASA
 ● Stepan Company
 ● Innophos Holdings, Inc.
 ● Oceana Group, Ltd.

 
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and

businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Omega. However, certain of these
companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Omega. The analyses necessarily involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other
factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect Omega.
 

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of the company’s firm
value (calculated as the market value of the company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any debt and minority interest, less
unconsolidated investments and cash and cash equivalents) to the consensus equity research analyst estimate for the company’s
EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the years ending December 31, 2017 (the
“2017E FV/EBITDA”) and December 31, 2018 (the “2018E FV/EBITDA”).
 

Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected (1) multiple reference ranges for 2017E FV/EBITDA of 5.5x – 9.0x
and (2) multiple reference ranges for 2018E FV/EBITDA of 5.0x – 8.0x.
 

After applying such ranges to the projected EBITDA for Omega for the year ending December 31, 2017 and the year ending
December 31, 2018, based on projections provided by Omega management, the analysis indicated the following implied per share
equity value ranges for Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05:
 
  Implied Per Share Equity Value  
  Low   High  
2017E FV/EBITDA  $ 15.55  $ 24.90 
2018E FV/EBITDA  $ 14.45  $ 22.55 
 
 

The ranges of implied per share equity value for Common Stock were compared to Omega’s closing share price of $16.55 on
October 4, 2017 and the proposed merger consideration of $22.00 per share of Common Stock.

Table of Contents
 

Selected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan reviewed selected transactions involving
acquired businesses and assets that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to Omega’s business or assets.
Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:
 

Month/Year Announced  Acquiror  Target/Seller (Business/Division)
June 2017  Pelagia AS  FMC Corporation (Epax)
May 2015  Oceana Group, Ltd.  Daybrook Fisheries, Inc.
October 2013  Darling International Inc.  Vion Holding N.V. (Vion Ingredients)
November 2012  BASF SE  Pronova BioPharma ASA
August 2012  Royal DSM N.V.  Tortuga Companhia Zootécnica Agrária
May 2012  Royal DSM N.V.  Ocean Nutrition Canada
December 2010  Royal DSM N.V.  Martek Biosciences Corporation
 
 

None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the transactions selected were chosen
because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The
analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics
of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the merger.
 

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the ratio of the transaction value
to the target company’s EBITDA for the twelve-month period prior to announcement of the applicable transaction (“TV/LTM
EBITDA”).
 

Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected multiple ranges for TV/LTM EBITDA of 5.5x – 8.5x and applied
them to the EBITDA of Omega for the year ended December 31, 2017. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity
value range, rounded to the nearest $0.05, for Common Stock:
 
  Implied Per Share Equity Value  
  Low   High  
TV/LTM EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017  $ 15.55  $ 23.55 
 
 

The range of implied per share equity values for Common Stock was compared to Omega’s closing share price of $16.55 on
October 4, 2017 and the proposed merger consideration of $22.00 per share of Common Stock.
 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an
implied fully diluted equity value per share for Common Stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset
using estimates of the future unlevered cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with
respect to those cash flows by calculating their “present value”. The “unlevered free cash flows” refers to a calculation of the future
cash flows generated by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. Specifically, unlevered free cash flow
for this purpose represents EBITDA less taxes, capital expenditures and increases in net working capital, as applicable. “Present
value” refers to the current value of the cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the
present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital
and other appropriate factors. “Terminal value” refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated by the asset for periods
beyond the projections period.
 

J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that Omega is expected to generate for the three months ending
December 31, 2017 and during fiscal years 2018 through 2026 based upon financial projections prepared by Omega management. J.P.
Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values of Omega at the end of the period ending in 2026 by applying a perpetual growth
rate ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% to the unlevered free cash flow of Omega during the terminal period of the projections. The unlevered
free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values as of September 30, 2017 using a range of
discount rates from 7.5% to 8.5%. This discount rate range was based upon J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the weighted-average cost of
capital of Omega.

Table of Contents
 

Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value range, rounded to the nearest
$0.05, for Common Stock:
 
  Implied Per Share Equity Value  
  Low   High  
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  $ 18.75  $ 23.50 
 
 

The range of implied per share equity values for Common Stock was compared to Omega’s closing share price of $16.55 on
October 4, 2017 and the proposed merger consideration of $22.00 per share of Common Stock.
 

Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses
as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of
reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of Omega. The
order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at
its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion
as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion.
Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
 

Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to factors or events beyond the
control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily
indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P.
Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could
be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to Omega, and none of
the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, these companies were selected, among other reasons, because
they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered
similar to those of Omega. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of
J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could
affect the companies compared to Omega and the transactions compared to the merger.
 

As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Omega with respect to the merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience
and its qualifications, including J.P. Morgan’s familiarity with Omega from its engagement in connection with the 2017 Strategic
Review and Initial Strategic Review, and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with Omega and the industries
in which it operates.
 

J.P. Morgan received a fee from Omega of $2.0 million at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion. Omega has agreed to
pay J.P. Morgan an additional fee of approximately $5.5 million upon the closing of the merger. J.P. Morgan may also receive a fee
from Omega in the event that Omega receives a break-up fee in connection with the termination, or abandonment of the merger, or
failure of the merger to occur. In addition, Omega has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its
services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P.
Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have not had
any material commercial or investment banking relationships with Omega (other than in connection with the 2017 Strategic Review,

Unaudited Financial Projections of Omega
 

Omega does not usually make public detailed projections as to earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the
unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections. However, the senior
management of Omega regularly prepares, for internal purposes, prospective financial information on a standalone basis for up to five
years in connection with its ordinary course strategic planning. In connection with the 2017 Strategic Review, management prepared
prospective financial information regarding Omega’s future performance for an additional five years (collectively, the “Omega
Unaudited Financial Projections”). The Omega Unaudited Financial Projections were provided to the Omega Board and
representatives of J.P. Morgan, as the financial advisor to Omega, in July 2017 to assist in evaluating Omega’s operations and
prospects and the merger.
 

The prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Omega's
management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has neither audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures
with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express
an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. This prospective financial information was not prepared with a view
towards compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for the preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report
contained in this proxy statement relates to Omega's historical financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial
information and should not be read to do so. In the view of Omega’s management, this information was, based on certain growth
assumptions, prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of its preparation, and
presented, to the best of Omega’s management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial
performance of Omega on a standalone basis at the time of its preparation. However, this information is not fact and should not be
relied upon as being indicative of future results and you are cautioned not to rely on the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections. The
Omega Unaudited Financial Projections do not reflect any impact of the merger and do not take into account the potential
consequences should the merger fail to be consummated, and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in those contexts.
 

Neither Omega’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any
procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other
form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The reports of the independent registered public accounting firms contained
in this proxy statement relate to the historical financial information of Omega. The reports do not extend to the unaudited financial
projections and should not be read to do so.
 

In developing the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections, Omega’s management made material assumptions with respect to
Omega and its business for the periods covered by the projections, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
 ● for years 2017 through 2021, production volumes, sales volumes, prices, revenues, operating and other expenses from

existing and anticipated business activities, which resulted in animal nutrition segment operating income that decreased in
2017 and 2018 (due primarily to below average 2017 production) and increased in subsequent years, and human nutrition
segment operating income that increased each year; 

 
 ● for years 2022 through 2026, the expected rate of change of revenues and expenses from prior years’ projected amounts for

existing and anticipated business activities; 
 
 ● maintenance capital expenditure levels consistent with recent historical levels that grow modestly over time and remain

relatively stable as a percentage of revenues;
 
 ● with respect to 2017 organic growth projects, the amounts and timing of capital expenditures and production associated with

such projects;
 
 ● that Omega would not make any material acquisitions during the projected period;
 
 ● that working capital levels would fluctuate proportionally with revenue and expenses, and in aggregate remain relatively

stable as a percentage of revenues;
 
 ● the demand for Omega’s products;
 
 ● the taxes we will incur in the various jurisdictions in which we operate; and

 ● other general business and market assumptions, including with respect to fish catch and yields, and other regulatory and
financial assumptions.

All of these assumptions involve variables making them difficult to predict, and most are beyond the control of Omega. Although
Omega’s management believes that there was a reasonable basis for the underlying assumptions related to the Omega Unaudited
Financial Projections, the degree of uncertainty inherent in such assumptions and the risk the projections will differ materially from
actual results increases with the length of the forecasted period.  For example, when preparing the projections for the periods after
2021, Omega’s management did not reevaluate the individual assumptions on which the projections for the annual periods through
2021 were based because Omega’s management believed that such reevaluation would not be meaningful considering the number of
unknown factors and distant time.  Instead, for the periods after 2021, management simply estimated the rate of change in the items
estimated for prior periods.  Management believed that its assumptions regarding the rate of change for such periods were reasonable
considering the task of forecasting annual periods which are well into the future, but management also believes that such assumptions
are inherently highly speculative. As a result, the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections for the years 2022 through 2026 are subject
to an even greater degree of uncertainty than the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections for the earlier periods.

(1) “Adjusted EBITDA” for purposes of this table means earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, and
Bioriginal acquisition post-closing consideration. Omega believes Adjusted EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely
used by investors as an indicator of Omega's performance of its ongoing operations, and assists such investors in comparing a
company's performance of its ongoing operations on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and
should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flows
or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of any potential synergies or costs related to the
merger.

debt balances were not expected to increase during the projection period.

  
(2) Acquisition post-closing consideration represents expense related to restricted stock issued as partial consideration for the 2014

acquisition of Bioriginal.
 
 

The estimates and assumptions underlying the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections are inherently uncertain and, though
considered reasonable by Omega’s management as of the date of the preparation of such projections, are subject to a wide variety of
significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that are outside of the control of Omega and could
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections, including, among other
things, the matters described in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” The risk that actual
results could differ materially from those contained in the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections increases with the length of the
forecasted period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projections are indicative of the future performance of Omega, or

that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections, particularly for
projections beyond 2021. Inclusion of the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as a
representation by any person that the results contained in the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections will be achieved. In light of the
foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections, Omega’s stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections.
 

The inclusion of the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication such
projections are material information of Omega or predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as financial guidance,
and it should not be relied upon as such. The Omega Unaudited Financial Projections are not included in this proxy statement in order
to induce any Omega stockholder to vote in favor of any of the proposals at the special meeting, but have been included solely because
the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections were made available by Omega’s management to the Omega Board and representatives of
J.P. Morgan, and the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections were used by representatives of J.P. Morgan in connection with the
rendering of its fairness opinion to the Omega Board and performing its related financial analyses, as described in the section entitled
“The Merger—Opinion of Omega’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.” Omega has made no representation to
Cooke or Merger Sub in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Omega Unaudited Financial Projections.

Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger
 

In considering the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be
aware that our executive officers and directors have interests in the merger described below that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Omega Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in
making its determinations and recommendations in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
You should consider the interests of our directors and executive officers that are described in this proxy statement as well as the intent
of such directors and officers to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the merger.
 
Consideration Payable for Shares Held Pursuant to the Merger Agreement
 

The executive officers and directors of Omega who hold Common Stock at the closing of the merger will be eligible to receive the
same merger consideration as the other Omega stockholders with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock held. The
executive officers and directors of Omega held, in the aggregate, 486,930 shares of Common Stock (or approximately 2.2% of all
outstanding Common Stock) as of November 22, 2017, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding Omega Options or
subject to outstanding Omega Restricted Stock, which are discussed below. Dr. Gary L. Allee was a member of our board of directors
at the beginning of the fiscal year, but upon the termination of his term as a director prior to the filing of this proxy statement, he held
no outstanding Omega Options or Omega Restricted Stock.
 

The table below sets forth the number of shares held by the executive officers and directors of Omega as of November 22, 2017,

Performance Unit Plan (the “2017 Plan” and, together with the 2015 Plan and the 2016 Plan, the “Omega Plans”), each governing
long-term cash incentive performance unit awards (“Performance Units”) held by our executive officers, upon a Change of Control (as
defined in the applicable Omega Plan), which will occur at the effective time of the merger, outstanding Performance Units that have
been earned for completed calendar years of the applicable performance period will be paid at their actual amounts earned for that
completed calendar year, and for incomplete calendar years, the earning of the remaining Performance Units will be accelerated as of
the effective time and valued at the target value of $1.00 per Performance Unit; provided, that, if the effective time of the merger
occurs following the end of the 2017 calendar year, the amount earned for the completed 2017 calendar year will be deemed to be
$1.00 per Performance Unit. Thus, Performance Units granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan will be earned at $1.26 per Performance Unit;
Performance Units granted pursuant to the 2016 Plan will be earned at $0.93 per Performance Unit; and Performance Units granted
pursuant to the 2017 Plan will be earned at $1.00 per Performance Unit.

favorable as the base salary or regular hourly rate of pay that such continuing employee received immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, and (ii) medical, dental and welfare benefits that in the aggregate are at least as favorable as the medical, dental
and welfare benefits, exclusive of equity grants under Omega’s employee benefit plans, provided to such continuing employee
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for at least eleven months after the effective
time, Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to provide severance benefits to each continuing employee then eligible to participate
in the employee severance benefits plan who is terminated during such period at least as favorable to those provided in the employee
severance benefits plan, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan.

2017 Annual Bonus
 

Under the merger agreement, Cooke has agreed to pay, or cause to be paid, to each continuing employee (i) employed by the
surviving corporation as of the date such bonus is paid or (ii) whose employment was terminated without cause by the surviving
corporation, an annual bonus for 2017 in an amount calculated in the manner agreed upon in connection with negotiation of the
merger within 60 days of the end of the year; provided, that, in the event a continuing employee is terminated without cause by the
surviving corporation prior to the date that such bonus is paid, such amount will be pro-rated for the number of days in 2017 that such
continuing employee was employed by Omega or the surviving corporation.
 
Severance Arrangements
 

Omega provides severance benefits to substantially all of its employees, the intended benefits of which are to provide financial
protection in the event of a qualifying termination of employment event. Each of the executive officers has entered into an
employment agreement with Omega (or Bioriginal in the case of Mr. Vidal), providing for severance benefits upon certain defined
termination events, including heightened severance benefits upon the occurrence of certain termination events following a change of
control, or in the case of Mr. Held, upon a change of control only. Omega has amended the employment agreement with each
executive officer other than Messrs. Held and Vidal in connection with the merger to add constructive termination as a termination
event triggering severance benefits. The events that trigger heightened severance payments following a change of control include (i) a
termination of employment by Omega without cause and (ii) a detrimental changes in the executive’s terms and conditions of
employment, in each case within a certain period following a change of control.
 

Employment Agreement with Mr. Scholtes. Under Mr. Scholtes’ amended employment agreement, upon termination of his
employment by Omega other than for Due Cause (as defined in the employment agreement), death or Disability (as defined in the
employment agreement) and provided that Mr. Scholtes delivers an effective release in favor of Omega, Mr. Scholtes is entitled to
receive a lump sum payment equal to his annual base salary, payable within five days after the date that such release becomes
effective. Upon either (i) a termination by Omega for any reason other than Due Cause, death, Disability or (ii) a resignation by Mr.
Scholtes due to a Constructive Termination within twelve months after a Change of Control (each as defined in the employment
agreement), which will occur at the effective time of the merger, and provided that Mr. Scholtes delivers an effective release in favor
of Omega, Mr. Scholtes is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to two times his annual base salary, payable within five days
after the date that such release becomes effective.
 

Mr. Scholtes’ employment agreement contains restrictions on his use of Omega’s confidential information and also provides that
Mr. Scholtes will assign to Omega all worldwide rights in any intellectual property that he develops which relates to the business,
products or services of Omega. During the term of the agreement, and for the three years following Mr. Scholtes’ termination of
employment for any reason, Mr. Scholtes may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any business or enterprise that is primarily engaged
in the business of producing or selling fish meal, fish oil or fish solubles, induce any Omega employee to leave his or her employment
with Omega, or solicit any distributor or customer to amend its business relationship with Omega.
 

Employment Agreements with Dr. Griffin and Messrs. Johannesen, Livingston and Deihl. The terms of the amended employment
agreements with Dr. Griffin and Messrs. Johannesen, Livingston and Deihl are substantially identical to Mr. Scholtes’ employment
agreement, except that upon either (i) a termination of employment by Omega for any reason other than Due Cause, death, Disability
or (ii) a resignation due to a Constructive Termination within twelve months after a Change of Control (each as defined in the
employment agreements), which will occur at the effective time of the merger, and provided that the applicable executive officer
delivers an effective release in favor of Omega, such executive officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to one-and-one-
half times his annual base salary, payable within five days after the date that such release becomes effective.

Employment Agreement with Mr. Held. Under Mr. Held’s employment agreement, upon (i) a termination of his employment by
Mr. Held for Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement) or by Omega without Cause (as defined in the employment
agreement), or (ii) a Change of Control of Omega (as defined in the employment agreement), which will occur at the effective time of
the merger, Mr. Held is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 2.99 times Mr. Held’s “base amount” (as defined in Section
280G of the Code). If the total amount of such payment were to be found by the IRS to equal or exceed three times Mr. Held’s “base
amount,” then Mr. Held could incur an excise tax in connection with such excess parachute payment. If any excise or similar purpose
taxes and/or penalties or interest thereon pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code (or any successor or other
comparable federal, state or local tax law) are imposed on Mr. Held’s base salary, severance or change of control payments, other
incentive or supplemental compensation, benefits, allowances, awards, payments, reimbursements or other perquisites, or other
payment in the nature of compensation (whether or not provided for under the employment agreement), the employment agreement
provides that Omega will reimburse Mr. Held for such taxes, penalties or interest thereon such that Mr. Held is placed in the same
after-tax position (including federal, state and local taxes) he would have been in had no such taxes, penalties or interest thereon been
incurred (such reimbursement, the “Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment”). Omega has also agreed to indemnify and hold Mr. Held
harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any liabilities (including but not limited to costs and expenses) incurred in connection with the
payment described in the preceding sentence.
 

Mr. Held’s employment agreement contains restrictions on his use of Omega’s confidential information and also provides that Mr.
Held will assign to Omega all worldwide rights in any intellectual property that he develops which relates to the business, products or
services of Omega. During the term of the agreement, and for the three years following the termination of his employment agreement,
Mr. Held may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any business or enterprise that is in competition with Omega, induce any Omega
employee to leave his or her employment with Omega, or solicit any distributor or customer to amend its business relationship with
Omega. The employment agreement also provides for the advancement and reimbursement of Mr. Held’s costs and expenses in
conjunction with any disputes relating to the agreement.
 

Employment Agreement with Mr. Vidal. Under Mr. Vidal’s employment agreement with Bioriginal, upon a termination of his
employment by Bioriginal other than for “just cause” (as defined in the employment agreement) or by Mr. Vidal as a result of a
Constructive Dismissal (as defined in the employment agreement), (i) Mr. Vidal is eligible to receive a payment in lump sum or by
salary continuance, at Bioriginal’s option, equal to 18 months’ compensation, defined as the average of base salary and bonus paid to
Mr. Vidal in the two years immediately prior to the termination of his employment, (ii) any options held by Mr. Vidal under any
employee stock option plan will remain outstanding until they expire by their terms, and (iii) for a period of 18 months, or until he
becomes employed in another position providing similar benefits, Mr. Vidal is entitled to continued participation, or if such
participation is not permitted, to a payment equal to the estimated cost to Bioriginal of providing such participation to Mr. Vidal, in all
group medical, dental and insurance plans.
 

Mr. Vidal’s employment agreement contains restrictions on his use of Bioriginal’s confidential information and also provides that
Mr. Vidal will assign to Bioriginal all worldwide rights in any intellectual property that he develops which relates to the business,
products or services of Bioriginal. For the twelve months following Mr. Vidal’s termination of employment for any reason, Mr. Vidal
has agreed to not engage in any business that is in competition with Bioriginal, induce any Bioriginal employee to leave his or her
employment with Bioriginal, or solicit any customer, supplier, reseller or personnel not to do business with Bioriginal.
 
Retention Awards
 

Under the terms of the retention bonus letter agreement between Omega and Mr. Vidal, Mr. Vidal is entitled to receive a one-time
payment in the amount of $100,000, conditioned on his continued employment with Omega and its subsidiaries through June 30,
2018. If there is a sale of the Bioriginal business prior to June 30, 2018, then upon the consummation of such sale, (i) Mr. Vidal’s
retention bonus payment will be accelerated, (ii) Mr. Vidal’s outstanding long-term incentive awards will vest in full, and (iii) Mr.
Vidal will receive an additional payment in the amount of $100,000.

Information for Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers
 

The information set forth below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding compensation that is based
on or otherwise relates to the merger that our named executive officers could receive in connection with the merger. The information
being reported with respect to our named executive officers describes the payments and benefits that would be payable under our
named executive officers’ employment agreements and the existing award agreements governing Omega Options, Omega Restricted
Stock and Performance Units, each as described above. The amounts in the table below were calculated using the following
assumptions: (i) the effective time of the merger was November 22, 2017, (ii) the applicable price per share of Common Stock is
$22.00 which is equal to the merger consideration, (iii) the merger would constitute a change of control for purposes of each named
executive officers’ employment agreement and the Omega Plans, (iv) unless otherwise stated below, the employment of each named
executive officer has been terminated by Cooke without cause or by (A) Mr. Held for Good Reason or (B) the other named executive
officers due to a Constructive Termination (as defined in their respective employment agreements), (v) each named executive officer
(other than Mr. Held) has properly executed a release of claims against us and complied with any restrictive covenants applicable to
such named executive officer, and (vi) certain other assumptions as specified in the footnotes to the table have been made. Values
shown below do not take into account any increase in compensation that may occur following the date of this filing or following the
merger. Some of the assumptions used in the table below are based upon information not currently available and, as a result, the actual
amounts to be received by our named executive officers may differ from the amounts set forth below. Except for payments made in
connection with Omega Options, Omega Restricted Stock, Performance Units and certain cash payments made to Mr. Held as
indicated in the footnotes to the table, which are “single trigger payments,” all payments quantified in the table below are “double
trigger” payments.

($)(3)   Total ($)  
Bret D. Scholtes  $ 2,287,908  $ 5,244,554   –  $ 7,532,462 
Andrew C. Johannesen  $ 1,121,263  $ 300,784   –  $ 1,422,047 
John D. Held  $ 5,144,056  $ 291,368  $ 1,831,628  $ 7,267,052 
Dr. Mark E. Griffin  $ 1,079,482  $ 291,368   –  $ 1,370,850 
Montgomery C. Deihl  $ 907,186  $ 198,506   –  $ 1,105,692 

 

(1) The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate value of cash severance payments that would become payable to our named
executive officers under their respective employment agreements. The payment under Mr. Scholtes’ employment agreement
consists of an amount equal to two times his base salary at the time of termination, payable in a lump sum within five days after
the date on which Mr. Scholtes’ release of claims in favor of Omega becomes effective. Payments under each of Messrs.
Johannesen and Deihl and Dr. Griffin’s employment agreements consist of an amount equal to one-and-one-half times the
applicable named executive officer’s base salary at the time of termination, payable in lump sum within five days after the date on
which his release of claims in favor of Omega becomes effective. The payment under Mr. Held’s employment agreement is a
“single trigger” payment due upon a Change of Control (as defined in his employment agreement), which will occur at the
effective time of the merger, and consists of an amount equal to 2.99 times Mr. Held’s “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G
of the Code), which as of November 22, 2017, such base amount is equal to $1,543,343.

 
The amounts in this column also reflect a pro-rata portion of each named executive officer’s 2017 annual bonus, pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement, assuming a termination without cause as of November 22, 2017. If the named executive officer
remains employed through the date the 2017 annual bonuses are regularly paid, then such named executive officer would receive
the full amount of his 2017 annual bonus, rather than the pro-rated amount reflected in this column.

 
In addition, the amounts in this column reflect accelerated earning and payment of outstanding Performance Units anticipated to
occur at the effective time of the merger at (i) earned levels for completed calendar years during the applicable performance
period and (ii) at the target level of $1.00 per Performance Unit for incomplete calendar years during the applicable performance
period. The Performance Units are “single trigger” awards that will be accelerated in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement at the effective time of the merger. The aggregate payments included in this column are comprised of the following:

 

Name  Cash Severance   
2017 Annual

Bonus   
Performance

Units  
Bret D. Scholtes  $ 1,100,000  $ 198,458  $ 989,450 
Andrew C. Johannesen  $ 510,000  $ 185,436  $ 425,827 
John D. Held  $ 4,614,595  $ 115,194  $ 414,267

Montgomery C. Deihl  $ 450,000  $ 185,686  $ 271,500 

 
Each of the named executive officers is subject to certain trade secret, confidentiality and post-employment restriction provisions,
pursuant to which the named executive officers have agreed to confidentiality and non-disparagement terms. In addition, each
named executive officer has agreed to non-competition provisions with respect to certain competing businesses and non-
solicitation restrictions with respect to employees and customer relationships for defined periods of time. See the section entitled
“The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger—Severance Arrangements” for more
information regarding such provisions.

Table of Contents
 
(2) The amounts in this column reflect the number of shares of time-based Omega Restricted Stock that each of our named executive

officers holds as of November 22, 2017 multiplied by the merger consideration, which are “single trigger” awards that will be
accelerated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement at the effective time of the merger. In addition, with respect to
Mr. Scholtes, the amount indicated includes an amount equal to the sum of the product, for each Omega Option that Mr. Scholtes
holds as of November 22, 2017, of (x) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the applicable exercise price of such
Omega Option and (y) the number (determined without reference to vesting requirements or other limitations on exercisability) of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Omega Option.

 
The Omega Restricted Stock reported under this column consist of the grants made to our named executive officers on each of
February 26, 2015, March 8, 2016 and February 27, 2017, that each of our named executive officers holds as of the date hereof
that are anticipated to become converted into the right to receive the merger consideration at the effective time of the merger as
described above. The Omega Options reported under this column consist of the number of Omega Options covering shares of our
Common Stock that Mr. Scholtes holds as of the date hereof, all of which are fully vested and will be cashed out in connection
with the closing of the merger. The aggregate value of the Omega Restricted Stock and Omega Options held by our named
executive officers are comprised of the following:

 

Name  Omega Options   
Omega

Restricted Stock 
Bret D. Scholtes  $ 4,547,000  $ 697,554 
Andrew C. Johannesen   –  $ 300,784 
John D. Held   –  $ 291,368 
Dr. Mark E. Griffin   –  $ 291,368 
Montgomery C. Deihl   –  $ 198,506 

 
(3) Amounts in this column reflect the estimated amount of the Excise Tax Gross-Up Payment for Mr. Held described above in the

section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger—Severance Arrangements,”
based on an assumed excise tax rate of 20% and the compensation and benefit levels in effect as of November 22, 2017, which is
a “single trigger” payment. Any change in the assumptions used to calculate this amount may produce different results.

 
Omega Board of Directors and Management Following the Merger
 

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the effective time of the merger, until successors are duly elected or
appointed in accordance with law, our board of directors will be replaced by the board of directors of Merger Sub, and our officers will
be replaced by the officers of Merger Sub.
 
Indemnification and Insurance
 

The merger agreement provides that after the effective time of the merger, Cooke will cause Omega or the surviving corporation,
as the case may be, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless against any threatened or actual
claim or proceeding and related losses, and provide advancement of expenses to, all present and former officers, directors, employees
and agents (including fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit plans) of Omega or any of its subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified
Person”), to the same extent such Indemnified Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
the merger agreement by Omega pursuant to Omega’s organizational documents and the indemnification agreements of Omega in
existence on the date of the merger agreement. In addition, from and after the closing of the merger, and for six years after the
effective time of the merger, Cooke will cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
Omega or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, and each of its subsidiaries (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of Omega or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, or any of its subsidiaries) regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less favorable to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Omega and each of its subsidiaries in existence on the date of the merger
agreement. From and after the effective time of the merger, any agreement between any Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and
Omega or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses
will be assumed by the surviving corporation, will survive the merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

Table of Contents
 

Additionally, prior to the closing of the merger, Omega will obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension of
the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of Omega’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and Omega’s existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
effective time of the merger with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the effective time of the merger
(including claims with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby); provided that the cost per annum payable for such “tail” insurance policy will not exceed 250% of the amount per annum
Omega paid in its current fiscal year (such maximum amount, the “Maximum Tail Premium”) and if the cost for such “tail” insurance
policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then Omega will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.
 

If Omega for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policy as of the closing of the merger, the surviving corporation will,
and Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
effective time of the merger the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Omega in place as of the date of the merger agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
those provided under Omega’s existing policies as of the date of the merger agreement, or the surviving corporation will, and Cooke
will cause the surviving corporation to purchase comparable policies for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as those provided under Omega’s existing policies as of the date of the merger agreement; provided that the cost per
annum payable for such “tail” insurance policy will not exceed the Maximum Tail Premium and if the cost for such “tail” insurance
policies exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the surviving corporation will, and Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to,
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
U.S. Antitrust Approval
 
Under the HSR Act, we cannot complete the merger until we give notification and furnish information to the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and until the applicable waiting period expires or is terminated.
On October 19, 2017, we and Cooke each filed a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act. On October 30, 2017,
U.S. antitrust authorities notified Omega and Cooke that early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act had been granted.
 
Foreign Antitrust Approval
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will require filings and approvals
pursuant to Germany’s Act against Restraints of Competition and filings pursuant to Canada’s Competition Act. We and Cooke
submitted the requisite filings in Canada and Germany on October 27, 2017. We obtained approval from the German competition
authorities on November 22, 2017.
 
MARAD
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will require the approval of
MARAD. Omega has agreed to reasonably assist Cooke in the preparation for the sale of certain or all of the MARAD Assets
(including by transferring such MARAD Assets and FAA Assets identified by Cooke and related employees to the MARAD
Subsidiary) pursuant to the MARAD Sale Agreement. Additionally, each of Omega and Cooke has agreed to comply in all material
respects with all of its obligations under the MARAD Sale Agreement, and each of Cooke and Merger Sub has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approval of MARAD, including causing its
affiliates to enter into the Fish Supply Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement on or prior to the closing date of the merger.
 
Judgments and Probation Conditions
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will require OPI to notify and
obtain permission of its Probation Officer required as part of its obligations to sell, assign or transfer assets (including the affected
marine vessels) that are subject to the Judgments and Probation Conditions. On November 15, 2017, OPI's probation officer notified
OPI that she would not have any objection to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and OPI intends to file an
appropriate notice with the relevant courts prior to the consummation of the merger.

Table of Contents
 
FAA and FCC Approvals
 

Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the MARAD Sale Agreement, including the
transfer of certain radio licenses and spotter aircraft from OPI, will require the consent of the FAA and the FCC.
 
Other Regulatory Approvals
 

Other than as described above, neither Omega nor Cooke is currently aware of any material governmental approvals or actions
that are required for completion of the merger. We expect that if any such additional material governmental approvals or actions are
required, those approvals or actions will be sought.
 
General
 

Each of the parties to the merger agreement has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to complete the merger and to prepare and
file all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents to
obtain approval from any governmental authority or other third party that is required to be obtained in connection with the merger,
including approval from U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities and MARAD. The parties to the merger agreement have also agreed to
use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, licenses, waivers,
expiration of the applicable waiting periods and other confirmations required to be obtained from any governmental authority
(including from MARAD) or other third parties that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and to defend or contest any proceeding challenging the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. In
connection with obtaining MARAD Approval or compliance with the Premerger Notification Rules, Omega has also agreed not to
discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction with any governmental authority or to alter its businesses or commercial practices in
any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Cooke’s freedom of action with respect to, or Cooke’s ability to
retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Omega.
 

While we expect that all regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, there is no certainty that these approvals will
be obtained or obtained within the period of time contemplated by the merger agreement, that any such approvals would not involve
the imposition of conditions that may be materially adverse to Cooke, Merger Sub, any of their respective affiliates or the surviving
corporation or that other regulatory challenges to the merger will not be made. If a challenge is made, we cannot predict the result.
Any conditions with respect to such regulatory approvals could result in the conditions to the completion of the merger not being
satisfied.
 

The approval of any regulatory application or completion of regulatory review merely implies the satisfaction of certain
regulatory criteria, which do not include review of the merger from the standpoint of the adequacy of the consideration to be received
by our stockholders. Further, regulatory approvals or reviews do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the merger.
 
No Appraisal Rights
 

Pursuant to Section 92A.390 of the NRS, no holder of any shares of Common Stock will have or will be entitled to assert
dissenter’s rights or any rights of appraisal as a result of or in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger.
 
Financing of the Merger
 

The total amount of funds necessary to consummate the merger and the related transactions will be funded by Cooke, including
the funds needed to (i) pay our stockholders the aggregate merger consideration due to them under the merger agreement; (ii) pay the
option consideration; and (iii) pay fees and expenses payable by Cooke and Merger Sub under the merger agreement and in connection
with the debt financing described below. Cooke will obtain such funding through the proceeds from one or more debt financing
transactions. The obligation of Cooke and Merger Sub to complete the merger is not conditioned upon Cooke obtaining financing.

Table of Contents
 
Debt Commitment Letter
 

Concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, Cooke entered into the Debt Commitment Letter providing for financing
of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement through (a) either (i) up to $350 million in aggregate principal amount of
senior secured notes (the “notes”) in a Rule 144A private placement, or (ii) if all or any portion of the notes are not issued on or prior
to closing, up to $350 million of senior secured increasing rate loans (the “bridge loans”) or (iii) a combination of notes and bridge
loans and (b) up to $25 million of loans under a $100 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility.
 

The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter will terminate at
the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the merger agreement, (ii) the Outside Date, unless each of the lenders agrees to an
extension, and (iii) the consummation of the merger with or without the funding of the debt financing.
 
DNB Credit Facility
 

Concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, Cooke entered into the DNB Credit Facility pursuant to which DNB
agreed to loan Cooke a principal amount of $200 million, the proceeds of which will be contributed as equity to an intermediate
holding company of Merger Sub and used to fund a portion of the merger consideration.
 

The definitive documentation governing the debt financing has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt
financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.
 
Delisting and Deregistration of the Common Stock
 

If the merger is completed, the Common Stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE and will be delisted and deregistered under
the Exchange Act.
 
Accounting Treatment
 

The merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.
 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
 

The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to our stockholders due to the
receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the merger. This summary is based upon the provisions of the
Code, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial authority and administrative rulings and practice, all as in effect on the date of
this proxy statement. All of these authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis and to differing interpretations, all
of which could result in tax consequences different from those described below. This discussion assumes that the shares of our
Common Stock are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code by their beneficial owners. This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of such
stockholder’s unique investment circumstances, or to stockholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws
(for example, a bank, life insurance company or other financial institution; dealers or brokers in securities or currencies; a trader in
securities that elects mark-to-market treatment; tax-exempt organizations; a retirement plan or other tax-deferred account; S-
corporations, partnerships, or other pass-through entities; a mutual fund; a real estate investment trust or regulated investment
company; a personal holding company; U.S. expatriates; controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies; a
corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; “U.S. Holders” (as defined below) whose functional currency
is not the U.S. dollar; stockholders who hold shares of our Common Stock as part of a hedging, “straddle,” constructive sale,
conversion or other risk-reduction strategy or integrated transaction; or stockholders who acquired their shares of our Common Stock
through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). In addition, this discussion is general in nature
and does not address any aspect of state, local, alternative minimum, estate, gift or non-U.S. taxation that may be applicable to a
particular stockholder.
 

No ruling has been requested from the IRS in connection with the merger or related transactions. Accordingly, the discussion
below neither binds the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a contrary position. Furthermore, no opinion of counsel has been or will be
rendered with respect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.

A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our Common Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual,
corporation, estate, or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.
 

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of
our Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in that partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership that holds our Common Stock, you are urged to consult your own tax
advisor.
 

Omega stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the
receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the merger (including the application and effect of
any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws).
 
U.S. Holders
 

The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the sum of any cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our Common Stock.
 

Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will be eligible for the preferential U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to long-
term capital gains if the U.S. Holder has held our Common Stock for more than one year as of the date of the merger. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of shares of our Common Stock at different
times or at different prices, the U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis and holding period separately for each block of our Common
Stock.
 
Non-U.S. Holders
 

Subject to the discussion below under the section titled “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding”, a Non-U.S. Holder
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding taxes on the exchange of our Common Stock for cash in the merger
unless:
 

 
● any gain recognized on the exchange is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in

the U.S. (and, if an income tax treaty applies, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the Non-U.S. Holder);
 

 
● the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year that includes the

date of the merger and certain other conditions are satisfied; or
 

 

● Omega is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time
during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending on the date of the merger and (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period in
the Common Stock, and, if the shares of our Common Stock are “regularly traded on an established securities market”, the
Non-U.S. Holder held (directly, indirectly or constructively), at any time during such period, more than 5% of our
outstanding Common Stock.

Table of Contents
 

If the Non-U.S. Holder’s gain is described in the first bullet, then the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal
income tax under the rules described above as if it were a U.S. Holder of our Common Stock and, in the case of a foreign corporation,
may be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax
treaty).
 

If the Non-U.S. Holder is described in the second bullet, then such Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain, which may be offset
by certain U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder.
 

If Omega and the Non-U.S. Holder meet the criteria described in the third bullet, then the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax under the rules described above as if it were a U.S. Holder of our Common Stock. Although there can be no
assurances in this regard, Omega does not believe that it is or was a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes during the
applicable five-year period preceding the merger.
 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
 

Any cash received by a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder in the merger may be subject to information reporting, and may be
subject to backup withholding unless such holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification
number and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements under the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and may be allowed as a refund or credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
 

The foregoing discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to be, and should not be
construed as, legal or tax advice to any stockholder of Common Stock. You should consult your own tax advisors to determine
the particular tax consequences to you (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other
tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger.
 
Litigation Relating to the Merger
 

On September 11, 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Sehlmeyer v. Scholtes was filed against two of Omega’s
officers and six of its directors in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada for alleged breach of fiduciary duties. On October 11,
2017 and again on November 13, 2017 , the plaintiff amended his complaint, deleting the derivative claims and instead asserting
putative class action claims against Omega, one of Omega’s officers, and seven of Omega’s directors arising out of the announcement
that Omega had entered into a merger agreement under which it will be acquired by Cooke. In addition, after the filing of the
preliminary proxy on October 30, 2017, three federal putative class actions captioned Franchi v. Omega Protein Corporation
(November 6, 2017), Fromberger v. Omega Protein Corporation (November 7, 2017), and Durkee v. Omega Protein Corporation
(November 13, 2017) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada.  These federal actions assert  fiduciary duty
claims, as well as federal securities law claims involving purportedly insufficient disclosure to shareholders. The plaintiffs seek
rescission of the merger, attorneys’ fees and other costs, other equitable relief and damages.
 

Omega believes the allegations in these complaints are without merit, and it intends to defend vigorously against all of the
allegations. However, at this time it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters or its effects on Omega or the merger. An
adverse judgment for monetary damages could have an adverse effect on the operations and liquidity of Omega.

Table of Contents
 
Directors and Officers
 

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the directors of the surviving
corporation as of the effective time of the merger. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be the officers of the surviving corporation as of the effective time of the merger.
 
When the Merger Becomes Effective
 

The consummation of the merger will take place on a date to be specified by the parties to the merger agreement, which will be no
later than the third business day after satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with the merger agreement) of the last to occur of the
conditions to closing set forth in the merger agreement (other than any such conditions which by their nature can only be satisfied at
closing, which will be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived at such time); provided,
however, that if the Marketing Period has not ended at least two business days prior to the date on which the closing would otherwise
occur, the closing will instead occur on the earliest of:
 

 
● a date specified by Cooke during the Marketing Period that is a business day on no fewer than two business days’ notice of

such date from Cooke to Omega;
 
 ● the second business day immediately following the last day of the Marketing Period; and
 

 
● the second business day prior to the Outside Date (in each case subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions

to the completion of the merger (other than any such conditions which by their nature can only be satisfied at closing, which
will be required to be so satisfied (or waived) at that time).

 
The Marketing Period is a fifteen (15) consecutive business day period (subject to certain blackout dates) that will commence

upon the receipt of certain specified required information by the Lead Arranger, subject to certain conditions.
 

As soon as practicable after the closing of the merger, articles of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the NRS (the “Articles of Merger”) will be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The
merger will become effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada,
or at such later time as will be agreed upon by Cooke and Omega and specified in the Articles of Merger.
 
Effect of the Merger on the Common Stock
 

At the effective time of the merger each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger (excluding any shares of Common Stock to be cancelled without payment of any merger consideration therefor pursuant to
the following paragraph), including the Omega Restricted Stock, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration.
 

Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of Omega and each share of Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Cooke or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cooke or Omega immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
canceled and cease to exist as of the effective time of the merger without any consideration being exchanged therefor and no payment
or distribution will be made with respect thereto.
 

Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
remain outstanding and will be converted into and will represent one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
surviving corporation, so that, after the effective time of the merger, Cooke will be the holder indirectly of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the surviving corporation’s common stock.
 
Treatment of Equity Awards
 

Each of Cooke and Omega agrees that it will take such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause at the effective time of the
merger each Omega Option then outstanding, whether or not exercisable, under the Omega Stock Plans, to become fully exercisable
(if not then fully exercisable), and such Omega Options will thereafter represent only the right to receive, upon delivery of an option
surrender agreement, for each share of Common Stock subject to such Omega Option, an amount in cash equal to the option
consideration. The actions described in the preceding sentence will occur at the effective time of the merger without any action on the
part of Merger Sub, Cooke or any of their respective stockholders.

Table of Contents
 

Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the restrictions applicable to each share of Omega Restricted Stock will
immediately lapse, and, at the effective time of the merger, each share of such Omega Restricted Stock will be converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration. Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to pay through the surviving corporation’s payroll the
merger consideration for the Omega Restricted Stock in accordance with the merger agreement, and Omega will cooperate with Cooke
prior to the effective time of the merger to arrange for such payment at such time through payroll.
 
Payment of the Merger Consideration
 

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will enter into an agreement with Omega’s transfer agent (or another entity
reasonably acceptable to Omega) to act as agent for the holders of Common Stock (but not holders of the Omega Restricted Stock or
Omega Options) in connection with the merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive any merger consideration to which such holders
will become entitled. On the closing date of the merger and prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger, Cooke will deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock (but not Omega Restricted Stock or
Omega Options), for payment through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of the aggregate merger
consideration payable under the merger agreement (the “Payment Fund”). The Paying Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the merger consideration payable with respect to Common Stock (but not Omega Restricted Stock or Omega Options) out of
the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub, subject to certain limitations.
If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts owed to holders of shares of Common Stock,
Cooke will take all steps necessary to enable or cause the surviving corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the
Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under the merger agreement, and Cooke and the surviving corporation will in
any event be liable for payment thereof.
 

As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within three business days following the effective
time of the merger, Cooke will cause the Paying Agent to deliver a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) to each record holder,
as of the effective time of the merger, of  (a) an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger represented shares of Common Stock (the “Certificates”) or  (b) shares of Common Stock represented by book-entry
(“Book-Entry Shares”). The Letter of Transmittal will specify that delivery will be effected only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or the surviving corporation, as applicable, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to
the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and will set forth instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the merger consideration. Additionally, as soon as
practicable after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within three business days following the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation will deliver to each holder of an Omega Option as of the effective time of the merger an option
surrender agreement, and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Omega Option in exchange for the option
consideration.
 

Upon surrender to the Paying Agent or the surviving corporation, as applicable, of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Cooke will cause the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to pay such holder,
the merger consideration for each share of Common Stock and Omega Restricted Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the merger consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.
 

Upon delivery of the option surrender agreement, duly executed, the holder of the Omega Option will be entitled to receive
promptly and, in any event, within five business days after the later of the effective time of the merger or the delivery of the option
surrender agreement in exchange therefor, and Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to pay to such holder through the surviving
corporation’s payroll (or to the extent the holder is not then an employee, by check drawn on an Omega account), the amount of cash
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the merger agreement, and the Omega Option so surrendered will then be
canceled.

Without any determination of the Omega Board as set forth in the preceding two bullets, Omega, directly or indirectly through its
representatives, may have discussions with any third party that has made an Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry solely in order to clarify
and understand the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and the ability of such third party to consummate a
Superior Proposal. Omega must make available to Cooke any material information relating to Omega or its subsidiaries that is made
available to such third party which was not previously made available to Cooke at substantially the same time it is made available to
such third party.
 

Omega will notify Cooke promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Omega of any Acquisition
Proposal or Inquiry, which notice will identify the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and will
include a copy (if in writing) of all written materials and correspondence provided by such person in connection with the Acquisition
Proposal or Inquiry or modification or amendment of any such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry. Omega will thereafter keep Cooke
reasonably informed of any material developments regarding any such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry.
 

For purposes of this proxy statement:
 

 

● “Acquisition Proposal” means any proposal of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons), directly
or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or outstanding voting
power of Omega, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation, other business combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction of involving Omega or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of
persons) acquires or would acquire control of assets of Omega or any of the subsidiaries of Omega representing more than
15% of the fair market value of all the assets or that generated more than 15% of the net revenues or net income of Omega
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction.

 

 

● “Superior Proposal” means any written proposal made by a third party (i) to acquire, directly or indirectly, not less than 50%
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or businesses or assets of Omega or any subsidiary of Omega that generated not
less than 50% of Omega’s consolidated net revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the
preceding twelve months, in each case whether by way of merger, amalgamation, share exchange, tender offer, exchange
offer, recapitalization, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise, and (ii) which is otherwise on terms which the Omega Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors), taking into account such matters as it deems
appropriate, including all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, and likelihood that such proposal will
be consummated on the terms proposed and the identity of the person making the proposal, that the proposal, (A) if
consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Omega’s stockholders
than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed.

 

 

● “Intervening Event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that was not known the Omega
Board, as of or prior to the date of the merger agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were
not reasonably foreseeable by the Omega Board as of or prior to the date of the merger agreement), which event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known (or the magnitude or material consequences thereof become
known if not reasonably foreseeable by the Omega Board prior to the date of the merger agreement) to or by the Omega
Board prior to obtaining the Omega Stockholder Approval; provided, however that an Intervening Event will not include (i)
any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence resulting from or arising out of the announcement or pendency of,
or any actions required to be taken by Omega (or to be refrained from being taken by Omega) pursuant to, the merger
agreement, (ii) the receipt, exercise or effect of an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) any change in the price or
trading volume of the Common Stock, (iv) Omega’s exceeding any estimates, projections or other expectations of Omega’s
revenues, earnings, cash flows or other operating results for any period; provided, however, that nothing therein will prevent
inclusion of any of the underlying causes of changes otherwise excluded pursuant to the clause immediately preceding this
proviso in the determination of whether an Intervening Event has occurred, and (v) fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Change of Recommendation
 

Neither the Omega Board nor any committee thereof may make an Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the
foregoing restriction, the Omega Board or any committee thereof may, in response to a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the Superior Proposal termination right if and only if each of
the following conditions are satisfied:
 
 ● Omega has provided to Cooke at least five days’ prior notice of its intent to take such action (a “Superior Proposal Notice”);
 

 

● if requested to do so by Cooke, Omega has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with
Cooke during the period starting on the first day following Cooke’s receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice and ending at
11:59 p.m. Houston, Texas time on the fifth day following such receipt (such period, a “Superior Proposal Notice Period”),
any changes or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that Cooke proposes to make; and

 

 
● at the end of such Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Omega Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its

financial advisors and taking into account any changes or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by
Cooke to Omega, that such Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 
Notwithstanding anything to contrary in the merger agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Omega Stockholder Approval,

the Omega Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, in response to an Intervening Event, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Omega Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and
 

 
● Omega has provided to Cooke at least five days’ prior notice of its intent to take such action, which notice will provide a

reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event (such notice being referred to herein as an “Intervening Event
Notice”);

 

 

● if requested to do so by Cooke, Omega has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith with
Cooke during the period starting on the first business day following Cooke’s receipt of the Intervening Event Notice and
ending at 11:59 p.m. Houston, Texas time on the fifth day following such receipt (such period, an “Intervening Event Notice
Period”), any changes or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that Cooke proposes to make; and

 

 

● at the end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Omega Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and taking into account any changes or modifications to the
terms of the merger agreement proposed by Cooke to Omega in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, that failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 
Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, any factually accurate public statement by Omega that

describes Omega’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of the merger agreement with respect thereto, will not be
deemed to be a recommendation of such Acquisition Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation
of the Omega Board in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits Omega or
the Omega Board from (i) taking and disclosing to Omega’s stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure to
Omega’s stockholders if the Omega Board determines after consultation with its legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would be reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with applicable law, (iii) informing any person of the existence of the provisions
contained in the merger agreement or (iv) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to Omega’s stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

In connection with obtaining MARAD Approval or compliance with the Premerger Notification Rules, Omega has also agreed

not to discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction with any governmental authority or to alter its businesses or commercial
practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Cooke’s freedom of action with respect to, or Cooke’s

Cooke agrees that, from and after the date the merger agreement and prior to the effective time of the merger, and except as may
be agreed in writing by Omega or as may be expressly permitted pursuant to the merger agreement, Cooke will not, and will not

Omega has agreed to take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of obtaining the Omega Stockholder Approval as promptly as practicable following the date the SEC confirms it has no further
comments to the preliminary proxy statement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Omega may adjourn or postpone
the special meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the proxy statement is provided to
Omega’s stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the special meeting, as otherwise required by law or, if at the
time the special meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to

time of the merger, and (ii) medical, dental and welfare benefits that in the aggregate are at least as favorable as the medical, dental
and welfare benefits, exclusive of equity grants under Omega’s employee benefit plans, provided to such continuing employee
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for at least eleven months after the effective
time, Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to provide severance benefits to each continuing employee then eligible to participate

Table of Contents
 
Indemnification and Insurance
 

The merger agreement provides that after the effective time of the merger, Cooke will cause Omega or the surviving corporation,
as the case may be, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless against any threatened or actual
claim or proceeding and related losses, and provide advancement of expenses to, all present and former officers, directors, employees
and agents (including fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit plans) of Omega or any of its subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified
Person”), to the same extent and under the same terms such Indemnified Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date of the merger agreement by Omega pursuant to Omega’s organizational documents and the indemnification
agreements of Omega in existence on the date of the merger agreement. In addition, from and after the closing of the merger, and for
six years after the effective time of the merger, Cooke will cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of Omega or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, and each of its subsidiaries (or in such documents of any
successor to the business of Omega or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, or any of its subsidiaries) regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less favorable to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Omega and each of its subsidiaries in existence on the date of
the merger agreement. From and after the effective time of the merger, any agreement between any Indemnified Person, on the one
hand, and Omega or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of
expenses will be assumed by the surviving corporation, will survive the merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.
 

Additionally, prior to the closing of the merger, Omega will obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension of
the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of Omega’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and Omega’s existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
effective time of the merger with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the effective time of the merger
(including claims with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby); provided that the cost per annum payable for such “tail” insurance policy will not exceed 250% of the Maximum Tail
Premium and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then Omega will obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium. If Omega will for any reason fail to obtain such
“tail” insurance policy as of the closing of the merger, the surviving corporation will, and Cooke will cause the surviving corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the effective time of the merger the current policies of
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Omega in place as of the date of the merger
agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as that provided under Omega's existing policies as of the date of
the merger agreement, or the surviving corporation will, and Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to purchase comparable
policies for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided under Omega’s existing policies
as of the date of the merger agreement; provided that the cost per annum payable for such “tail” insurance policy will not exceed the
Maximum Tail Premium and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policies exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the surviving
corporation will, and Cooke will cause the surviving corporation to, obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.
 
Stockholder Litigation
 

In the event that any claim or legal or administrative proceeding by any governmental authority or other person that questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or seeks damages related to the merger agreement, the
merger, or the other transactions contemplated thereby is brought, or, to the knowledge of Omega or Cooke, as applicable, threatened
in writing, prior to the effective time of the merger against Omega or its subsidiaries and/or the members of the Omega Board or
Cooke or its subsidiaries, each of Cooke and Omega will promptly notify the other party to the merger agreement of any such
litigation and will keep the other party to the merger agreement reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Omega and
Cooke will give each other the reasonable opportunity to participate, at their own expense, in the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any pending or threatened litigation related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. None of Omega
or its subsidiaries or representatives will compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come
to an arrangement regarding any such stockholder litigation or consent to the same unless Cooke has consented in writing; provided,
however, that Cooke’s consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Compliance with Judgments
 

As of the effective time of the merger, Cooke and Merger Sub will cause OPI to continue to comply with all the terms, obligations

will cause OPI to notify and obtain permission of its Probation Officer required as part of its obligations to sell, assign or transfer
assets (including the affected marine vessels) that are subject to the Judgments and Probation Conditions. Also as of the effective time
of the merger, each of Cooke and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
comply with and to facilitate the compliance with the Judgments and Probation Conditions by OPI. In addition, Cooke and Merger
Sub will encourage the party which ultimately acquires or owns the MARAD Assets and the FAA Assets to:
 

 

● in connection with obtaining judicial consent to transfer the MARAD Assets and the FAA Assets, enter into any required
modification of the Judgments and Probation Conditions setting out, or otherwise confirming to the satisfaction of the
applicable court and its Probation Officer, the allocation of the legal obligations established under this compliance with
judgments covenant;

 

 

● provide reasonable and unimpeded access to OPI following the closing of the merger such that OPI may perform such
monitoring and oversight of the court-ordered environmental and safety compliance plans (“Compliance Plans”) applicable to

Conditions;

● provide reasonable and unimpeded access to third party monitors and auditors to conduct evaluations and inspections of

implementation and compliance with the Compliance Plans.
 
Financing
 

Each of Cooke and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Facilities, and will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision under, the Financing Facilities if such amendment, modification or waiver:
 
 ● reduces the aggregate amount of the cash proceeds available from the debt financing; or
 

 
● imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the debt financing,

or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing Facilities in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to:

 
 ● materially delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the debt financing on the closing date of the merger; or
 

 
● materially and adversely impact the ability of Cooke or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against other parties to the

Financing Facilities.

Each of Cooke and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to:
 
 ● maintain in full force and effect the Financing Facilities;
 

 
● negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Facilities on the terms and conditions contained

in the Financing Facilities;
 

 
● satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Cooke and Merger Sub to funding in the Financing Facilities that are

within their control; 
 

 
● in the event that all conditions in the Financing Facilities and the merger agreement have been satisfied, to consummate the

debt financing at or prior to the closing; and
 
 ● comply with its obligations under the Financing Facilities.
 

In the event that all of the mutual conditions and all of Cooke and Merger Sub’s conditions to closing the merger have been
satisfied or waived, Cooke and Merger Sub will cause the financing sources to fund, on the closing date of the merger, the debt
financing, to the extent the proceeds from the Financing Facility are required to consummate the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and will enforce their rights under the DNB Credit Facility or Debt Commitment Letter, as
applicable. Cooke and Merger Sub will not take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the DNB Credit Facility or the Debt Commitment Letter or in any definitive agreement related to the debt
financing. Cooke and Merger Sub must also take certain steps to keep Omega reasonably informed of the status of the debt financing.
 

If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable as set forth in the merger agreement or otherwise, and such portion is
necessary to fund an amount sufficient to consummate the merger upon the terms contemplated by the merger agreement and pay all
related fees and expenses of Cooke, Merger Sub and their respective representatives, Cooke and Merger Sub will use their reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from the same or alternative sources on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to Cooke and Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than those set forth in the Financing Facilities, in an
amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the debt financing being replaced that is still available, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding anything
in the merger agreement to the contrary, in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Cooke or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require Cooke or Merger Sub to, and neither Cooke nor Merger Sub will be required to:
 
 ● pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Facilities; or
 

 
● agree to any term that is outside of, or less favorable than, any applicable economic provision of the Financing Facilities or

any related fee letter.
 
Financing Assistance from Omega
 

Omega will use its reasonable best efforts to, will cause each of its subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide all cooperation that is customary in
connection with the arrangement of the debt financing as may be reasonably requested by Cooke, provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Omega. Such cooperation includes, among other things:
 

 
● participating in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and lender and “road show”

presentations;
 

 

● furnishing Cooke (which Cooke may provide to its financings sources) with certain such financial statements, pro forma
financial information, financial data, audit reports, and other information of the type and form that would be required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act if the debt financing were a registered public offering by Omega
alone of its securities on Form S-1 (or any successor forms thereto) under the Securities Act;

● furnishing Cooke (which Cooke may provide to its financings sources) with information related to Omega and its subsidiaries

required by regulatory authorities including under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Patriot Act, if requested at least ten business days prior to the effective time of the merger;

 

 
● facilitating the delivery to Cooke of a customary “comfort letter” required by the terms of the debt financing by Omega’s

registered public accounting firm, including by delivering customary management representation letters to such accounting
firm; and

 

 
● using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Cooke to satisfy the conditions precedent to the debt financing to the extent

within the control of Omega and causing the taking of corporate actions by Omega and its subsidiaries reasonably necessary
to permit the completion of the debt financing.

 
Omega will and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, supplement the information provided by or on behalf of any of them to

Cooke or any financing source on a reasonably current basis to the extent that any such information, to the knowledge of Omega,
contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make such information not materially
misleading, when taken as a whole.
 

Cooke will promptly upon request by Omega, reimburse Omega for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred and documented by Omega in connection with the cooperation of Omega contemplated by the
merger agreement and will indemnify and hold harmless Omega, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any information provided in writing by Omega or
any of its subsidiaries specifically for use in connection therewith.
 

However, nothing in the merger agreement requires any such cooperation to the extent that it would:
 

 
● require Omega or its subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any

liabilities or give any indemnities prior to the closing of the merger;
 
 ● unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of Omega or its subsidiaries;
 

 
● require Omega or its subsidiaries to enter into or approve any agreement or other documentation effective prior to the closing

of the merger or agree to any change or modification of any existing agreement or other documentation that would be
effective prior to the closing of the merger;

 

 
● require Omega, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) to approve or

authorize the debt financing prior to the closing of the merger;
 

 
● cause any mutual conditions or any of Cooke and Merger Sub’s conditions to the closing of the merger to not be satisfied or

otherwise cause any breach of the merger agreement; or

● reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate Omega or its subsidiaries’ respective organizational documents or any

applicable law in any material respect, or result in the contravention of, or result in a violation or breach of, or default under,
any contract.

 
Further, nothing in the merger agreement will require Omega to cause the delivery of legal opinions or reliance letters or any

solvency certificate.
 

Notwithstanding anything contrary in the merger agreement, Omega will not be deemed to be in breach of the financing
cooperation covenant so long as such breach is not willful.
 
Directors
 

Unless otherwise agreed to by Cooke, Omega will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Cooke at the closing the

THE MERGER PROPOSAL
 

We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement. A
description of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement are set forth under “The Merger” and “The Merger Agreement,”
respectively. We encourage you to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement.
 

Under the merger agreement, approval of this proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. If the proposal is not
approved, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will not be completed even if the other
proposals related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are approved.
 

Approval of this proposal requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of outstanding Common Stock as of the
record date. For this proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will be counted as present for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, but will have the same effect as a vote against the approval
of the merger proposal.
 

The Omega Board unanimously recommends that Omega’s stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

NON-BINDING PROPOSAL ON COMPENSATION RELATED TO THE MERGER
 

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
of 2010, requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
 

We are asking our stockholders to indicate their approval of the various “change of control” payments and other compensation
which our named executive officers will or may be eligible to receive in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in
the table under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger—Information for Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers” and the accompanying
footnotes. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed
part of Omega’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers, which has been disclosed to our stockholders as part
of the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and related sections of our annual proxy statements.
 

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
 

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Omega approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable to Omega’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘The Merger—Interests of Omega’s Executive
Officers and Directors in the Merger’.”

 
Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. Stockholders should note that this non-binding proposal

regarding merger-related compensation is merely an advisory vote that will not be binding on Omega or Cooke, their boards of
directors or our compensation committee. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their
terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to
receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms or conditions applicable to
such compensation, even if this proposal is not approved.
 

Approval of this proposal requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote, assuming a quorum is present. For this proposal, you may vote
“FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present at the special meeting, but will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the non-binding proposal. The failure to
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on this proposal.
 

The Omega Board unanimously recommends that Omega’s stockholders vote “FOR” the advisory, non-binding
compensation proposal.

ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
 

If Omega fails to receive a sufficient number of votes to approve the merger proposal, Omega may propose to adjourn the special
meeting, even if a quorum is present, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to approve the merger proposal. Omega currently
does not intend to propose adjournment of the special meeting if there are sufficient votes to approve the merger proposal.
 

Approval of this proposal requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote, assuming a quorum is present. For this proposal, you may vote
“FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present at the special meeting, but will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the adjournment proposal. The failure to
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on this proposal.
 

The Omega Board unanimously recommends that Omega’s stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Common Stock and the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option to the extent such difference is a positive number
(such amount in cash as described above being hereinafter referred to as the “Option Consideration”), less applicable Tax withholding.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the actions described in the preceding sentence shall occur at the Effective Time
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective stockholders. Not later than the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this Section 2.08.
 

Section 2.09     Treatment of Restricted Company Common Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restrictions
applicable to each share of restricted Company Common Stock (“Restricted Company Common Stock”) issued pursuant to the
Company Stock Plan shall immediately lapse, and, at the Effective Time, each share of such Restricted Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof, subject to applicable Tax
withholding. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll the Merger
Consideration for the Restricted Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.10(b)(ii), and the Company shall cooperate
with Parent prior to the Effective Time to arrange for such payment at such time through payroll. Not later than the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, all funds necessary to fulfill
the obligation under this Section 2.09 with respect to shares of Restricted Company Common Stock.
 

Section 2.10     Payment for Securities.
 

(a)     Paying Agent; Payment Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the
Company’s transfer agent (or another entity reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent for the holders of Company
Common Stock (but not holders of the Restricted Company Common Stock or the Company Stock Options) in connection with the
Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this
Article 2. On the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (but not Restricted Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options), for payment in accordance with this Article 2 through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to
permit payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.06 (the “Payment Fund”). The Paying Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration payable with respect to Company Common Stock (but not
with respect to the Restricted Company Common Stock or the Company Stock Options) pursuant to Section 2.06 out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub; provided, however, that such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively. If for
any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock under Section 2.06, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in
trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of shares for the Merger Consideration and the surrender of Company Stock Options for the Option Consideration. Any interest or
other income resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall become part of the Payment Fund.

(i)     As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event within three (3) Business Days following the
Effective Time, (A) Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of  an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock (the “Certificates”) or  shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry
Shares”), a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, (which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration set
forth in Section 2.06(b)(i) and (B) the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to each holder of a Company Stock Option as of
the Effective Time, (x) an Option Surrender Agreement, and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option Consideration.

 
(ii)     Upon surrender to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of a Certificate or Book-

Entry Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to pay such holder, the Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock and Restricted Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.10(b)(ii), each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article 2.

drawn on a Company account), the amount of cash which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.08, and the Company Stock Option so surrendered shall then be canceled. Until surrendered in accordance with

to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Option Consideration as contemplated by this Article 2.

 
(c)         Termination of Rights.

 
(i)     All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in

accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such

claims under the holder’s respective restricted stock agreement. After the close of business on the date of the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of Section 2.06(b) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Restricted Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates as provided in this Article 2.

 
(ii)     The surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option Consideration shall be deemed a

release of any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including causing the Company Board (or any committees thereof) to
take such actions as are allowed by the Company Stock Plans) to ensure that, following the Effective Time, (A) no
participant in the Company Stock Plans or any other plans, programs or arrangements of the Company shall have any right
thereunder to acquire or otherwise receive any capital stock of, or other equity or similar interests in, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate thereof and (B) the Company Stock Options may be surrendered in exchange for the
Option Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the

Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2.
 

(g)     Withholding. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, and Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code, or any provision of Applicable Law (whether federal, state, local, or
foreign). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such

ARTICLE 3
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 
Section 3.01     Representations And Warranties Of The Company. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules,

the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

and in good standing under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate, limited liability
company or limited partnership power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to
have such power, authority and governmental approvals would not or would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership to do business, and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.01(a), is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not or would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. A true and
complete list of all the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation of each Company Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interest of each Company
Subsidiary owned by the Company and each other Company Subsidiary as of such date, is set forth in Schedule 3.01(a). Except as set

(ix)     Schedule 3.01(p) sets forth the funded status of the Company Pension Plan as of the date hereof. The
Company has made contributions to the Company Pension Plan that are not less than the minimum required contribution
under Section 430 of the Code. The funding method used in connection with the Company Pension Plan is acceptable under
current IRS guidelines, and the actuarial assumptions used in connection with funding the Company Pension Plan are
reasonable. All unfunded liabilities of the Company Pension Plan have been properly accrued in material compliance with
GAAP. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”) has not instituted Proceedings to terminate the Company
Employee Benefit Plan or to appoint a trustee or administrator of the Company Employee Benefit Plan, and no
circumstances exist that constitute grounds under Title IV of ERISA for any such Proceeding. Without limiting the
foregoing, there has been no “reportable event” within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA that has not been fully and
accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would authorize the PBGC to
institute termination Proceedings with respect to the Company Pension Plan. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been
incurred or is expected to be incurred that could result in material liability to the Company Pension Plan, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or Parent, other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA that are
not yet due. No asset of the Company, and no asset of any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate which is to be
acquired by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, is subject to any Encumbrance under Code Section 430(k) or ERISA
Sections 303(k) or 4068 or arising out of any Proceeding filed under ERISA Section 4301(b).

 
(x)     With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a true and

complete copy of each of the following, together with all amendments: (1) the documents embodying the Company
Employee Benefit Plan or, where a Company Employee Benefit Plan has not been reduced to writing, a written summary of
all material terms thereof, (2) in the case of any funded Company Employee Benefit Plan, the trust agreement or similar
instrument, (3) for the three most recently completed years, (A) Form 5500 and all attached schedules, (B) audited financial
statements and (C) actuarial valuation reports, if applicable, (4) form agreements evidencing all outstanding Company Stock
Options and Restricted Company Common Stock and performance units (and, in each case, if individual agreements deviate
in any material respect from the form, the individual agreements), (5) in the case of each Company Employee Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter applicable to
the such Company Employee Benefit Plan (plus, if a request for a determination letter is pending, a copy of such request),
(6) related custodial agreements, insurance policies (including fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries of the
Company Employee Benefit Plan), administrative services and similar agreements, and investment advisory or investment
management agreements, if any, (7) copies of the most recent summary plan description (including any summaries of
material modifications issued since the last summary plan description) or similar summary and any employee handbook and
(8) copies of the policies and procedures established by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to 45 CFR Section

in good faith with Parent during the period starting on the first (1st) day following Parent’s receipt of the Superior Proposal

after consultation with its financial advisors and taking into account any changes or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, that such Acquisition Proposal
still constitutes a Superior Proposal. The parties agree that any amendment to the price or other material amendment to the
terms of a Superior Proposal following the delivery of a Superior Proposal Notice in respect of such Superior Proposal shall
require delivery of another Superior Proposal Notice to which the provisions of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section

(5) days or fifth (5th) day in such clauses shall be deemed to be two (2) days or third (3rd) day, respectively.

 
(e)     Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder

Approval, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, in response to an Intervening Event, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (i) the Company has provided to Parent at least five (5) days’ prior notice of its
intent to take such action, which notice shall provide a reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event (such notice being
referred to herein as an “Intervening Event Notice”) (it being understood and agreed that any such Intervening Event Notice shall not
in itself be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change); (ii) if requested to do so by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the period starting on the first (1st) Business Day following
Parent’s receipt of the Intervening Event Notice and ending at 11:59 p.m. Houston, Texas time on the fifth (5th) day following such
receipt (such period, an “Intervening Event Notice Period”), any changes or modifications to the terms of this Agreement that Parent
proposes to make; and (iii) at the end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and taking into account any changes or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

of the Company Board in favor of this Agreement and the Merger. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or making a

existence of the provisions contained in this Agreement or (iv) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company Stockholders). No
disclosures under this Section 4.03(f) shall be, in themselves, a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 8. Any
action permitted to be taken by the Company pursuant to Section 4.03 shall not constitute a breach of the Company’s representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (A) need not contain any “standstill” or similar covenant and (B) may include
provisions that are less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, so
long as the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement concurrently with execution of such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to (x) include substantially similar provisions for the benefit of the parties thereto and (y) waive
any “standstill” or similar covenant to the extent such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement does not contain any
“standstill” or similar covenant.

the Company or any Company Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that in the Company’s good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.04 or Sections 6.01 or 6.03 to the contrary, the
Company shall not be obligated to disclose any information if the Company, in its reasonable judgment, determines that doing so
would (i) violate any Applicable Law, (ii) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or other privilege with respect to such
information or (iii) result in a breach of an agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or result in the
disclosure of trade secrets of third parties.

respects with all of its obligations under that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement with Alpha VesselCo Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“VesselCo Holdings”), dated the date hereof and related to the sale of the MARAD Subsidiary (the “MARAD Sale
Agreement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company or any Company Subsidiary in good faith
takes any actions related to its obligations pursuant to this Section 4.05 and Closing does not occur, other than as a result of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or 8.01 (d)(i), Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries from any and all costs, expenses (including interest, court and other legal Proceeding costs,

reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to,

Parent, provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings

releases and instruments of termination or discharge) and assisting Parent in connection with obtaining surveys and title issuance as
reasonably requested in writing by Parent, (iv) executing and delivering any customary pledge and security documents, guarantee
agreements and any other any customary collateral documents, other definitive financing documents or other requested certificates or
documents, (v) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, offering

to the Effective Time, (vii) facilitating the delivery to Parent of a customary “comfort letter” required by the terms of the Debt
Financing by the Company’s registered public accounting firm, including by delivering customary management representation letters
to such accounting firm (it being understood that failure to obtain such comfort letter shall not constitute a breach of this covenant),
and (viii) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing to the extent
within the control of the Company and causing the taking of corporate actions by the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
necessary to permit the completion of the Debt Financing. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, supplement
the information provided by or on behalf of any of them to the Parent or any Financing Source on a reasonably current basis to the
extent that any such information, to the knowledge of the Company, contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make such information not materially misleading, when taken as a whole.
 

(b)     Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred and documented by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 4.06 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses

connection therewith.

(d)     In the event that any party becomes aware that any Required Information contains an untrue statement of material fact
or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made, such party will promptly advise the other party.
 

(e)     Nothing in this Agreement (including this Section 4.06) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it would
(A) require the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise
incur any liabilities or give any indemnities prior to the Closing, (B) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (C) require the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any

Section 4.07     Takeover Statutes. If the Company becomes aware that any Takeover Statute or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the Transactions and impose a material adverse effect on Parent or Merger Sub or on the parties’
abilities to consummate the Transactions in each case, other than as a result of actions taken by Parent or its Affiliates, the Company
and the Company Board shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and to
take such actions as are reasonably necessary, including, if applicable, amending the Company Organizational Documents to
specifically opt out of the application of the Nevada Control Share Law (NRS 78.378 – 78.3793) as permitted under such law, so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such
other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any statute or regulation on the Transactions.

Section 5.02     Indemnification and Insurance.
 

(a)     From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless against any threatened or actual claim or Proceeding and
related Losses, and provide advancement of expenses to, all present and former officers, directors, employees and agents (including

Company in existence on the date hereof. As used in this Section 5.02, “Losses” means any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,

between any Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, regarding

(c)     Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension of the
directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ Insurance Policies and the Company’s
existing fiduciary liability Insurance Policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with
respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby); provided that the cost per
annum payable for such “tail” insurance policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its current fiscal
year (such maximum amount, the “Maximum Tail Premium”) and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policy exceeds the Maximum
Tail Premium, then the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail
Premium. If the Company shall for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policy as of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company in place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as that provided under the
Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving

provided under the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof; provided that the cost per annum payable for such “tail”
insurance policy shall not exceed the Maximum Tail Premium and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policies exceeds the Maximum
Tail Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.
 

(d)     If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys its property and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.02 (including this Section 5.02(d)).
 

(e)     The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.02 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have
under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, under the NRS or any other
Applicable Law, under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. These
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.02 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.02 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such

Section 5.03     Employee Matters.
 

(a)     Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deem the period of employment with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (and with predecessor employers with respect to which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall have granted
service credit) for each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Continuing
Employee”) to have been employment and service with Parent and the Surviving Corporation for all purposes, including eligibility,
vesting and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of defined benefit plan benefits, the vesting of equity or equity-based awards or
where such service recognition would cause a duplication of benefits) for all of Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements that are similar to any such employee benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 

(b)     For eleven (11) months after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to provide to each Continuing Employee: (i) base salary or regular hourly rate of pay (as applicable) at least as favorable as
the base salary or regular hourly rate of pay that such Continuing Employee received immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)
medical, dental and welfare benefits that in the aggregate are at least as favorable as medical, dental and welfare benefits (for the sake
of clarity, such benefits shall not include equity grants under Company Employee Benefit Plans), provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, it being understood that existing employment agreements in effect as of June 30,
2017 will not be amended without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for at least eleven (11) months
after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide severance benefits to each Continuing Employee
eligible to participate in the Omega Protein Corporation Severance Benefits Plan as of the Effective Time who is terminated during
such period that are at least as favorable as those provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan, all as listed in
Schedule 5.03(b).
 

(c)     If the Continuing Employees are covered by medical and dental plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause the Surviving Corporation or the applicable
Affiliate to waive, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to
waive, all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participant and coverage
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents for the purpose of any such plans, except to the
extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the relevant Company Employee Benefit Plan; and (ii)
cause each such Continuing Employee to be given credit under such group medical and dental plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, for the year during which the Effective Time occurs, for any co-payments,
deductibles and similar payments such Continuing Employees made or incurred during such year under the relevant Company
Employee Benefit Plan. For the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall credit, or cause the Surviving
Corporation or the applicable Affiliate to credit each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with an amount of
vacation and sick leave equal to the employee’s unused vacation and sick leave under the Company’s vacation and sick leave policy
immediately prior to the Effective Time based on the policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or
compensation.

(d)     Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, to the extent not previously paid by the Company, an annual bonus
for 2017 to each Continuing Employee (i) employed by the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary as of the date such
bonus is paid or (ii) whose employment was terminated without cause (or if applicable under any severance or change of control
agreement, other than “for cause”) by the Surviving Corporation or a Company Subsidiary, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) in an
amount equal to no less than the Designated Percentage of the amount provided for on Schedule 5.03(d) for each such employee and
no more than the amount set forth on Schedule 5.03(d) for such employee; provided, however that in no event shall the Surviving
Company be required to pay in excess of $2,500,000 in the aggregate for 2017 annual bonuses to the non-executives, and all 2017
annual bonuses shall be paid within 60 days of the end of such calendar year; and provided further, that, in the event of a termination
without cause (or if applicable under any severance or change of control agreement, other than “for cause”) by the Surviving
Corporation or a Company Subsidiary of such Continuing Employee’s employment prior to the date that such 2017 annual bonus is
paid, the amount of such bonus shall be the amount set forth on Schedule 5.03(d), pro-rated for the number of calendar days in 2017
that such Continuing Employee was employed by the Company, the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their Affiliates. For
purposes of this paragraph “Designated Percentage” shall mean the percentage applicable to such employee as set out on Schedule
5.03(d).
 

(e)     Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Continuing Employee, within thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date, all amounts owed on the Closing Date under the Company’s 2015 Cash Incentive Performance Unit Plan, the
Company’s 2016 Cash Incentive Performance Unit Plan, and the Company’s 2017 Cash Incentive Performance Unit Plan in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Performance Unit Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of the performance units
under each Performance Unit Plan shall be (i) the actual amount earned for each calendar year of the applicable Performance Period
(as defined in the applicable Performance Unit Plan) ending prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) deemed to be $1.00 for each
calendar year of the applicable Performance Period ending after the date of this Agreement.
 

(f)     The provisions of this Section 5.03 are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and nothing in this Section 5.03,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or
kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.03, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any
Company Employee Benefit Plan providing benefits to any Continuing Employee or (ii) construed to prevent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit plan that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may establish or maintain.

Section 5.04     Financing.
 

(a)     Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Facilities (including the Debt Commitment Letters), and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Facilities if such amendment, modification or waiver
(i) reduces (or would have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the cash proceeds available from the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless (A) the Debt Financings is increased by a
corresponding amount and (B) after giving effect to any of the transactions referred to in clause (A) above, the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3.02(f) shall be true) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing
Facilities in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the date of the Closing or (B) materially and adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing Facilities (provided that, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this Section 5.04, Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add
additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents and other similar entities). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any such amendment, modification or replacement.
 

(b)     Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the Financing
Facilities (including the Debt Commitment Letters), (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
Facilities on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Facilities (or on terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub (in
the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms and conditions in the Financing Facilities), (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to funding in the Financing Facilities that are within their control, (iv) in the event that
all conditions in the Financing Facilities and this Agreement have been satisfied, to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing and (v) to comply with its obligations under the Financing Facilities. In the event that all conditions set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02 have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions which by
their nature can only be satisfied at Closing, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law)
waived at such time), Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing, to the
extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall enforce
their rights under the DNB Credit Facility or Debt Letters, as applicable (including in the event of any breach or purported breach
thereof by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and the other Financing Sources to fund such Debt Financing). Parent and
Merger Sub shall not take, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the DNB Credit Facility or the Debt Letters or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing.
Parent and Merger Sub shall not object to the utilization of any “market flex” provisions by any Financing Source. Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and provide the Company copies of material definitive arrangements for the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Facilities of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (B) of the receipt of any written notice from any Financing
Source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing
Facilities of any provisions of the Financing Facilities or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of
the Financing Facilities with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at
Closing, and (C) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain the Debt
Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger on substantially the same terms and conditions, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Facilities. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or
(C) of the immediately preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is
necessary to fund an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related
fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing (“Alternative Financing”) from the
same or alternative sources on terms and conditions that are no less favorable (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) to Parent and
Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than those set forth in the Financing Facilities, in an amount when added to the portion of the Debt
Financing being replaced that is still available, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be
deemed to be a part of the “Debt Financing” and any commitment letter for such Alternative Financing shall be deemed a “Debt
Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be required to, (i) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Facilities or (ii) agree to any term
that is outside of, or less favorable than, any applicable economic provision of the Financing Facilities or any related fee letter. Parent
shall deliver to the Company complete and correct copies of all agreements (including redacted fee letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing.

agreement contained in this Agreement which (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or
(b) as applicable, and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of thirty (30) days after the giving of notice to the
Parent of such breach and the Outside Date (a “Parent Terminable Breach”); provided that the Company is not then in
Company Terminable Breach; or

 
(iii)     if (A) the conditions to the Merger (other than any such conditions which by their nature can only be

satisfied at Closing, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived at such
time)have been satisfied, and (B) the Closing shall not have been consummated within three (3) Business Days after the
delivery of notice to the Parent that the conditions to the Merger have been satisfied.

conditions to Closing set forth in Article 7 has been satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions which by their nature can only
be satisfied at Closing, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived at such time)
shall constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.03     Amendments; Extensions and Waivers.
 

(a)     This Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement signed by each of the

consent of such Financing Source.
 

(b)     At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the

Applicable Law.

(ii)     If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii)(B) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) with respect to the Company’s breach or failure to perform an agreement or covenant under
Section 4.03 of this Agreement, (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting or such
termination, as applicable, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the
Company Stockholders and not withdrawn in the case of termination pursuant to clause (B) of Section 8.01(b)(ii) prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting or in the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) prior to the date of
termination, and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds,
concurrently with consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company Termination Fee; provided that for purposes of
this Section 9.04(b)(ii), all references to 15% in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to
“50%.”

 
(iii)     If (A) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 8.01(b)(i) and, at the

time of such termination, any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) (if and only if the applicable
event giving rise to the failure of such condition under either Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) to be satisfied arises in
connection with the failure of the waiting period under the HSR Act to expire or be terminated, approvals, consents or
authorizations under any Foreign Antitrust Laws or the MARAD Approval), shall have not been satisfied or (y)
Section 8.01(b)(ii)(A) (if, and only if, the applicable restraint or order giving rise to such termination arises in connection
with the failure of the waiting period under the HSR Act to expire or be terminated, approvals, consents or authorizations
under any Foreign Antitrust Laws, the MARAD Approval or the consent referenced in Schedule 3.01(c)(vi)(Item b)) and (B)
at the time of such termination, the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.01(b) (other than those related to the failure
of the waiting period under the HSR Act to expire or be terminated, or approvals, consents or authorizations under any
Foreign Antitrust Laws or the MARAD Approval), Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) and Section 7.02(c) (other than those
conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement, Parent shall pay the Regulatory Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of such termination to an
account as directed by the Company.

 
(iv)     The “Company Termination Fee” and the “Regulatory Termination Fee” shall each be equal to $20,000,000.

 
(c)     Integral Terms. Each party acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.04 are an integral part of

the Transactions, and without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement, and (ii) the damages resulting
from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or a Regulatory Termination Fee, as the
case may be, is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to
Section 9.04(b) are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions.

(d)     Limitation of Liability.
 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that if this Agreement is
terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under this
Section 9.04 and the Company Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, except in the case of a Willful Breach, and, upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.04, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any
further liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except in the case of a Willful Breach. In no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 
(ii)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that if this Agreement is

terminated under circumstances in which the Parent is obligated to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee under this
Section 9.04 and the Regulatory Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to the Company against the Parent and Merger Sub and their Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or
Affiliates with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, except in the case of a Willful Breach, and, upon payment of
the Regulatory Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.04, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or
Affiliates shall have any further liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except in the case
of a Willful Breach. In no event shall the Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

(a)     Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that

have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said counsel. Each party and its
counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

(b)     The parties hereto agree that any reference to an item in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of such party to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is
applicable to such other representations, warranties or covenants. The inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
reference to a dollar amount in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact or used to establish any standard of materiality or define any terms under this Agreement.
 

Section 9.06     Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.
 

(a)     The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The provisions of Section 5.02 and, from and after the Effective
Time, the provisions of Article 2 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable after the Effective Time by, the Persons
referred to therein and their respective heirs and Representatives. The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person
against all reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon
request as provided in Section 5.02(a), relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Person’s rights under Section 5.02 regardless
of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification. Except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder; provided, however, that each Financing Source shall be an express third party beneficiary with respect to Sections 9.03,
9.06, 9.07, 9.08, 9.09, and 9.14. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s fraud or Willful Breach, as a
result of which damages would be payable, then the Company Stockholders, acting solely through the Company, shall be beneficiaries
of this Agreement and shall be entitled to pursue any and all legally available remedies, including equitable relief, and to seek
recovery of all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, including reasonable attorneys’ fees; provided,
however, that the rights granted pursuant to this sentence shall be enforceable only by the Company, on behalf of the Company
Stockholders, in the Company’s sole discretion, it being understood and agreed that such rights shall attach to such shares of Company
Common Stock and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements, or other amounts
recovered or received by the Company with respect to such rights may, in the Company’s sole discretion, be (i) distributed, in whole or
in part, by the Company to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any date determined by the Company or
(ii) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company deems
fit.
 

(b)     No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto; provided that Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, may assign, without the consent of any other Person or party, any or all of its rights pursuant to this
Agreement, and each of the other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby, including its rights to indemnification, to any of
its Financing Sources as collateral security.

Section 9.07     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Nevada, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state that would direct a matter to another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any and all claims arising under the Financing Facility (including any claim, controversy or
dispute against or involving any Financing Source, including their respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is
hereby intended to be an express third party beneficiary of this Section 9.07) shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the state of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of laws rules or provisions
(whether of the state of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the state of New York; provided, however, that the laws of the State of Nevada shall govern in determining (a) the interpretation of a
“Company Material Adverse Effect” and whether a “Company Material Adverse Effect” has occurred, (b) the accuracy of any Omega
Representation (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letters) and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent has the right to
terminate its obligations, or refuse to consummate the transactions, under this Agreement and (c) whether the transactions under this
Agreement have been consummated in accordance with the terms hereof (in each case, without regard to the principles of conflicts of
laws thereof, to the extent that the same are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would require or permit the application of the
law of another jurisdiction).
 

Section 9.08     Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of
its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in the state courts located
in the State of Nevada or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any of the federal courts of the United States of America located in
the State of Nevada, (ii) irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in
any such Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from such court, and (iv) agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in any other court. Each party agrees that service of process in any such Proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court and notice provided in Section 9.01 shall be
deemed effective service of process on such party. The parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law;
provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties hereto, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, will bring, or support, any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing Facility or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, anywhere other than
in (i) any New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, and it is acknowledged and agreed that the provisions set forth in Section 9.09 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall
apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or third-party claim.

Section 9.09     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO

FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE
FOREGOING WAIVER; (iii) SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.09.
 

Section 9.10     Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall
become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and
unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).
 

Section 9.11     Entire Agreement; No Other Representations and Warranties.
 

(a)     This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the documents and
instruments entered into or delivered pursuant hereto, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
 

(b)     Except for the representations and warranties contained herein, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect
to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information made available to the Company in connection with the Transactions.
 

Section 9.12     Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants
and restrictions of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.13     Remedies.
 

(a)     Specific Performance; Remedies of Parent and Merger Sub. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 8, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described in Section 9.08 and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, including the Company’s obligation to consummate the Merger.
 

(b)     Specific Performance; Remedies of the Company. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 8, the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (including any failure to close the Merger where all of the conditions to Parent’s
and Merger Sub’s obligations to close (other than those that by their terms can only be satisfied at Closing)) in the courts described in
Section 9.08 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including the Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to
consummate the Merger.
 

(c)     Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 9.08 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the
terms of this Agreement at law or in equity, and that such explicit rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the
Transactions and without such rights, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the
other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement), in no event shall the Company, or any equity holder thereof be entitled to or be permitted to seek, specific performance in
respect of any Financing Source.

Annex C
 

October 5, 2017
 
The Board of Directors
Omega Protein Corporation
2105 City West Boulevard, Suite 500
Houston, Texas 77042-2838
 
Members of the Board of Directors:
 
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Omega Protein Corporation (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such
holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cooke Inc. (the “Acquiror”).
Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2017 (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and
its subsidiary, Alpha MergerSub, Inc., the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Company, the
Acquiror or their respective affiliates, will be converted into the right to receive $22.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
 
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and
financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of
the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the
consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the
Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial
analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business; and (vi) performed such other financial
studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
 
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the
Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations
of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
  
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available
or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any
such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any
obligation to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of
any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or
forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also
assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the
Agreement. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement
and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax
experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed
that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be
obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as
of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any
obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to
the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we
express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to
the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in
the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
 
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company
for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the
Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. Please be advised that during the two years
preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material
commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company or the Acquiror. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a
proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of
our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,
bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any
time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
 
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid to the holders of
the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
 
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided
to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should
vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or
in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full
in any proxy or information statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any
manner without our prior written approval.
 
Very truly yours,
 
/s/ J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
