MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
 

 
Dear Stockholders:

Kemper Corporation (“Kemper”) and Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation (“Infinity”) have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of February 13, 2018 (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), providing, among other things, that, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper will merge with and into Infinity, with Infinity
surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper (the “Merger”).

If the Merger is completed, each share of Infinity common stock, no par value per share (“Infinity common stock”), outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares owned by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of
its subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares under
Ohio law) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into, at the election of the holder of such share, subject to proration and
adjustment as described in the Merger Agreement, either (i) mixed consideration consisting of $51.60 in cash, without interest and subject to any
required withholding of taxes, and 1.2019 shares of Kemper common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Kemper common stock”), (ii) cash
consideration consisting of $129.00, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes or (iii) stock consideration consisting of 2.0031
shares of Kemper common stock. Holders of Infinity common stock who do not make an election will receive the mixed consideration described in
(i) above.

Based on the number of shares of Infinity common stock outstanding on April 20, 2018, the record date for the special meeting of Infinity
shareholders (the “Infinity special meeting”), Kemper expects to issue or reserve for issuance approximately 13.2 million shares of Kemper common
stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement (including shares of Kemper common stock issuable to Infinity shareholders and shares of Kemper common
stock issuable pursuant to the vesting and/or conversion of Infinity’s equity-based incentive awards). Based on this number and the number of shares of
Kemper common stock outstanding on April 16, 2018, the record date for the annual meeting of Kemper stockholders (the “Kemper annual meeting”),
upon the closing, pre-existing Kemper stockholders and former Infinity shareholders would own approximately 80% and 20% of the outstanding shares
of Kemper common stock, respectively.

Kemper common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbol “KMPR.” On April 26, 2018, Kemper
common stock closed at $60.40 per share as reported by the NYSE.

Infinity common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the trading symbol “IPCC.” On April 26, 2018, Infinity
common stock closed at $123.05 per share as reported by the NASDAQ.

The closing is subject to certain conditions, including Kemper stockholders approving a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of
Kemper common stock to Infinity shareholders in the Merger (the “share issuance proposal”) and Infinity shareholders approving a proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement (the “merger proposal”). Approval of the share issuance proposal by Kemper stockholders requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting with respect to the share issuance proposal, provided that a quorum
is present. Approval of the merger proposal by Infinity shareholders requires the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to exercise a majority
of the voting power of Infinity.

At the Kemper annual meeting, Kemper stockholders will be asked to vote on (i) the share issuance proposal, (ii) a proposal to adjourn the
Kemper annual meeting, for a period no longer than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate, for the absence of a quorum or to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit proxies in favor of the share issuance proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Kemper annual meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof (the “Kemper meeting adjournment proposal”), (iii) a proposal to elect the director nominees named in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus,

(iv) a non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal
year 2018, (v) a non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and (vi) any other business as may be properly brought before the Kemper annual meeting.

The Kemper board of directors unanimously recommends that holders of Kemper common stock vote (i) “FOR” the share issuance
proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, (iii) “FOR” the election of each of the director nominees named in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, (iv) “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s
independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 and (v) “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation
of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

At the Infinity special meeting, Infinity shareholders will be asked to vote on (i) the merger proposal, (ii) a proposal to approve, by a non-binding
advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Infinity’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “non-binding compensation advisory proposal”) and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the Infinity special
meeting, for a period no longer than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate, for the absence of a quorum or to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit proxies in favor of the merger proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Infinity special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof (the “Infinity meeting adjournment proposal”).

The Infinity board of directors unanimously recommends that holders of Infinity common stock vote (i) “FOR” the merger proposal,
(ii) “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and (iii) “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains certain statements regarding intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future of
Kemper Corporation (“Kemper”) and Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation (“Infinity,” and collectively with Kemper, “we,” “us,” and “our”),
which are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements give expectations, intentions,
beliefs or forecasts of future events or otherwise, and can be identified by the fact that they relate to future actions, performance or results rather than
relating strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as “believe(s),” “goal(s),” “target(s),” “estimate(s),” “anticipate(s),” “forecast(s),” “project(s),”
“plan(s),” “intend(s),” “expect(s),” “might,” “may,” “could” and variations of such words and other words and expressions of similar meaning are
intended to identify such forward-looking statements. However, the absence of such words or other words and expressions of similar meaning does not
mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong, and, accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such
statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and are not guarantees or assurances of
future performance. No assurances can be given that the results and financial condition contemplated in any forward-looking statements will be
achieved or will be achieved in any particular timetable. In evaluating these forward-looking statements, you should consider carefully the risks
described herein and in other reports that Kemper and Infinity file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). See “Risk Factors” and
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279.

With respect to the proposed transaction and the combined company, the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results,
performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking statements include, without
limitation:
 

 
•  failure of the combined company to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (as

defined on page 3) at all or in the anticipated timeframe;
 

 
•  changes to the value of the Merger Consideration (as defined on page 14) to be received by Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger

Agreement as a result of changes in the price of Kemper common stock;
 

 •  failure of the combined company to manage its growth;
 

 •  failure by the combined company to retain and motivate key employees and retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers;
 

 
•  legal proceedings that may be instituted against Kemper and Infinity following announcement of such proposed Merger (as defined on

page 3);
 

 
•  failure to receive regulatory clearances and approvals at all or within anticipated timeframes or the imposition by regulatory authorities of

conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met;
 

 
•  the interests of certain directors and executive officers of Infinity being different from, or in addition to, the interests of Infinity

shareholders;
 

 •  the potential impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets that the combined company will record;
 

 •  risks relating to the value of the shares of Kemper common stock (as defined on page 3) to be issued in the Merger;
 

 
•  effects on the market price of the common stock of the combined company of factors different from those affecting the market price for

shares of Infinity common stock (as defined on page 4) or for shares of Kemper common stock;

•  the effect of the Merger Agreement provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Infinity for a value greater than

the Merger Consideration or from trying to acquire Kemper;
 

 •  the significant transaction and integration costs that Kemper and Infinity will incur in connection with the proposed Merger;
 

 
•  the reduction of the percentage ownership interests of pre-existing Kemper stockholders due to the issuance of shares of Kemper common

stock to Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  any failure to complete the proposed Merger could negatively impact the stock prices and future businesses and financial results of Kemper

and Infinity;
 

 
•  any negative effects on the market price of Kemper common stock following the Merger if the Merger is not accretive and causes dilution to

the combined company’s earnings per share; and
 

 
•  other risks detailed from time to time in annual, quarterly and periodic reports filed by Kemper and Infinity with the SEC, whether or not

related to the proposed Merger.

YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH
SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. KEMPER AND INFINITY UNDERTAKE NO
DUTY OR OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR CORRECT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT AS A RESULT OF EVENTS,
CHANGES, EFFECTS, STATES OF FACTS, CONDITIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES, OCCURRENCES OR DEVELOPMENTS SUBSEQUENT
TO THE DATE OF THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE KEMPER ANNUAL MEETING
AND INFINITY SPECIAL MEETING

The following are some questions that you, as a Kemper stockholder or an Infinity shareholder, may have regarding the annual meeting of Kemper
stockholders (the “Kemper annual meeting”) or the special meeting of Infinity shareholders (the “Infinity special meeting”) and brief answers to
those questions. For more detailed information about the matters discussed in these questions and answers, see “The Kemper Annual Meeting” and
“The Infinity Special Meeting” beginning on pages 46 and 53 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, respectively. Kemper and Infinity encourage you
to read carefully the remainder of this joint proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not provide all of the information
that might be important to you with respect to the matters being considered at the Kemper annual meeting or the Infinity special meeting. Additional
important information is also contained in the Annexes to, and in the documents incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?
 

A: The Kemper board of directors (“Kemper Board”) and Infinity board of directors (“Infinity Board”) are using this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to solicit proxies of Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of February 13, 2018 (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Kemper, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper
and Infinity. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper will merge with and into Infinity, with Infinity surviving the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Kemper (the “Merger”). The Merger will be effective, after all of the conditions to the closing are satisfied or, to the extent permitted
by law, waived, at the time a certificate of merger is duly filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio or at such later
date and time as is agreed upon by Kemper and Infinity and specified in the certificate of merger (such completion or consummation of the
Merger, the “closing” or the “effective time”).

In addition, this joint proxy statement/prospectus also serves as a proxy statement for other matters not related to the Merger to be voted on by
Kemper stockholders at the Kemper annual meeting. See “The Kemper Annual Meeting” beginning on page 46.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is also a prospectus for Infinity shareholders because, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Kemper is
offering shares of Kemper common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Kemper common stock”) to be issued in exchange for shares of Infinity
common stock in the Merger, at the election of Infinity shareholders.

In order to complete the Merger, Kemper stockholders must approve the issuance of new shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (i.e., approve the “share issuance proposal” as defined below) and Infinity shareholders must adopt the Merger Agreement (i.e.,
approve the “merger proposal” as defined below).

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the Merger Agreement, the Merger, the Kemper annual meeting and
the Infinity special meeting, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting materials allow you to vote your shares without attending the
Kemper annual meeting or Infinity special meeting in person.

Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible.

Q: What are Infinity shareholders entitled to receive in the Merger?
 

A: If the Merger is completed, each share of Infinity common stock, no par value per share (“Infinity common stock”), issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its
subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
under Ohio law) will be cancelled and converted into, at the election of the holder of such share, subject to proration and adjustment, either (i)
“Mixed Consideration” equal to 1.2019 shares of Kemper common stock and $51.60 in cash, without interest and subject to any required
withholding of taxes, (ii) “Cash Consideration” equal to $129.00, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes, which
consists of an amount of cash, without interest, consisting of (a) $51.60 plus (b) the product of 1.2019 multiplied by $64.40, which was the
20-trading day volume-weighted average price of Kemper common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of February 12, 2018,
the day prior to the date of media publications regarding the proposed Merger (the “Fixed Volume-Weighted Average Price”) or (iii) “Stock
Consideration” equal to 2.0031 shares of Kemper common stock, consisting of the sum of (a) 1.2019 plus (y) 0.8012, which is the quotient
(rounded to four decimal places) of $51.60 divided by the Fixed Volume-Weighted Average Price (such sum, the “exchange ratio”). Holders of
Infinity common stock who do not make an election will receive the Mixed Consideration. The shares of Kemper common stock issuable and cash
payable upon conversion of shares of Infinity common stock in the Merger, and cash payable in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of Kemper
common stock, are referred to collectively as the “Merger Consideration.”

 
Q: When and where will the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting be held?
 

A: The Kemper annual meeting will take place on June 1, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. local time, at The Kemper Building, 20th floor, One East Wacker Drive,
Chicago, Illinois, 60601.

The Infinity special meeting will take place on June 1, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. local time, at Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, 2201 4th
Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203.

 
Q: What are Kemper stockholders voting to approve in connection with the Merger and why is this approval necessary?
 

A: Kemper stockholders are voting on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the
“share issuance proposal”). The approval by Kemper stockholders of the share issuance proposal is required by the rules and regulations of the
NYSE, and is a condition to the closing. Based on the number of shares of Infinity common stock expected to be outstanding and Infinity equity
awards expected to be vested or converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the effective time, Kemper expects to issue up to
approximately 13.2 million shares of Kemper common stock in the Merger.

Kemper stockholders are also voting on a proposal to adjourn the Kemper annual meeting, for a period no longer than twenty (20) business days
in the aggregate, for the absence of a quorum or to allow reasonable additional time to solicit proxies in favor of the share issuance proposal if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the Kemper annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof to approve the share issuance
proposal (the “Kemper meeting adjournment proposal”). The approval by Kemper stockholders of the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal is
not a condition to the closing.

 
Q: What other proposals will be presented to Kemper stockholders at the Kemper annual meeting?
 

A: In addition to the share issuance proposal and Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, Kemper stockholders are voting on the following at the
Kemper annual meeting:

 

 
•  a proposal to elect the ten director nominees named in this joint proxy statement/prospectus (the “Nominees”) in the section entitled

“Proposal 3: Election of Directors” beginning on page 68;

Table of Contents

 
•  a non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for

fiscal year 2018; and
 

 
•  a non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus.

See “The Kemper Annual Meeting” beginning on page 46.

 
Q: What are Infinity shareholders voting to approve at the Infinity special meeting and why is this approval necessary?
 

A: Infinity shareholders are voting on a proposal to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement (the “merger proposal”). The approval by Infinity
shareholders of the merger proposal is required under Ohio law and Infinity’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, dated as of
May 21, 2007 (the “Infinity Articles”), and is a condition to the closing.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(“Dodd-Frank”), Infinity is required to provide its shareholders the opportunity to vote to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Infinity’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, Infinity shareholders are being provided with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on
such payments. The approval by Infinity shareholders of this proposal (the “non-binding compensation advisory proposal”) is not a condition to
the closing.

Infinity shareholders are also voting on a proposal to adjourn the Infinity special meeting, for a period no longer than twenty (20) business days in
the aggregate, for the absence of a quorum or to allow reasonable additional time to solicit proxies in favor of the merger proposal if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Infinity special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (the “Infinity meeting adjournment
proposal”). The approval by Infinity shareholders of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal is not a condition to the closing.

 
Q: Why are the Infinity shareholders being asked to consider and vote on the non-binding compensation advisory proposal?
 

A. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted rules that require Infinity to seek an advisory, non-binding vote on matters
deemed to relate to “golden parachute” compensation. The non-binding compensation advisory proposal relates to certain “golden parachute”
compensation that will or may be paid by Infinity to its named executive officers as a result of or in connection with the Merger.

 
Q. What will happen if the non-binding compensation advisory proposal is not approved at the Infinity special meeting?
 

A. Approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal with respect to certain “golden parachute” compensation is not a condition to
closing. Accordingly, Infinity shareholders may vote against the “golden parachute” compensation proposal but still vote in favor of the merger
proposal. The non-binding compensation advisory proposal vote is an advisory, non-binding vote. If the Merger is completed, the “golden
parachute” compensation described in the non-binding compensation advisory proposal may be paid to Infinity’s named executive officers to the
extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and contractual arrangements, even if Infinity
shareholders do not approve the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

 
Q: Who can attend and vote at the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting?
 

A: The Kemper Board has fixed April 16, 2018 as the record date (the “Kemper record date”) for determining stockholders entitled to receive notice
of, and to vote at, the Kemper annual meeting or any adjournments or

postponements thereof. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on the Kemper record date for the Kemper annual meeting will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Kemper annual meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the Kemper record date,
there were 51,536,698 shares of Kemper common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Kemper annual meeting, held by approximately
3,400 holders of record. Each holder of Kemper common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Kemper common stock owned as of the
Kemper record date. Please note that participants in the Kemper Corporation 401(k) and Retirement Plan (the “401(k) and Retirement Plan”)
cannot vote shares of Kemper common stock held through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan in person at the Kemper annual meeting.

The Infinity Board has fixed April 20, 2018 as the record date (the “Infinity record date”) for determining shareholders entitled to receive notice
of and to vote at the Infinity special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Only shareholders of record at the close of business
on the Infinity record date for the Infinity special meeting will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Infinity special meeting and any
adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the Infinity record date, there were 10,941,936 shares of Infinity common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the Infinity special meeting, held by approximately 60 holders of record. Each holder of Infinity common stock is entitled to one
vote for each share of Infinity common stock owned as of the Infinity record date.

 
Q: What vote of Kemper stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals at the Kemper annual meeting?
 

A: With respect to the election of directors at the Kemper annual meeting, provided a quorum is present, each Nominee will be elected to the Kemper
Board by the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast, meaning that the number of shares voted “FOR” a Nominee exceeds the number of
shares voted “AGAINST” a Nominee. “Abstentions” and “broker non-votes” are not considered votes cast “FOR” or “AGAINST” the election of
Nominees, and will have no effect on the election of Nominees. If a Nominee who is an incumbent director of the Kemper Board receives a
greater number of votes “AGAINST” his or her election than votes “FOR” such election, such director must promptly tender his or her resignation
to the Kemper Board following certification of the vote with respect to the election of directors.

With respect to (i) the share issuance proposal, (ii) the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, (iii) the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the
selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 and (iv) the non-binding advisory
proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to each proposal will approve such proposal, provided a quorum is present.

 
Q: How does the Kemper Board recommend that Kemper stockholders vote on each of the proposals at the Kemper annual meeting?
 

A: The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that Kemper stockholders vote (i) “FOR” the share issuance proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Kemper
meeting adjournment proposal, (iii) “FOR” the election of each of the Nominees, (iv) “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the
selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 and (v) “FOR” the non-binding
advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q. What will happen if the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described

in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, is not approved at the Kemper annual meeting?
 

A. The vote by Kemper stockholders on the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, is advisory. The

result of the vote is therefore non-binding on Kemper, the Kemper Board or the Compensation Committee (as described on page 76). However,
Kemper’s Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements
and in evaluating Kemper’s executive compensation program.

 
Q: What vote of Infinity shareholders is required to approve (i) the merger proposal, (ii) the non-binding compensation advisory proposal

and (iii) the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal?
 

A: The approval by Infinity shareholders of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of Infinity shareholders entitled to exercise a majority
of the voting power of Infinity. The approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and the approval of the Infinity meeting
adjournment proposal require, in each case, the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast on the proposal at the Infinity special meeting,
provided that a quorum is present.

 
Q: How does the Infinity Board recommend that Infinity shareholders vote on each of the proposals at the Infinity special meeting?
 

A: The Infinity Board unanimously recommends that Infinity shareholders vote (i) “FOR” the merger proposal, (ii) “FOR” the non-binding
compensation advisory proposal and (iii) “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What should Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders do now in order to vote on the proposals being considered at the Kemper

annual meeting and Infinity special meeting?
 

A: Holders of Kemper common stock as of the Kemper record date and holders of Infinity common stock as of the Infinity record date may vote now
by proxy by:

 

 •  completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope;
 

 •  calling the toll-free number specified on the enclosed proxy card; or
 

 •  accessing the Internet website specified on the enclosed proxy card.

Both Kemper and Infinity strongly encourage their stockholders and shareholders of record, respectively, to vote using the enclosed proxy
card.

If you hold Kemper common stock or Infinity common stock in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a bank, broker, trust
or other nominee holder of record, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please refer to
the voting instruction card used by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to see if you may submit voting instructions using
the Internet or by telephone.

Holders of Kemper common stock or Infinity common stock may also vote in person by attending the Kemper annual meeting or Infinity special
meeting, as applicable. If you plan to attend the Kemper annual meeting or Infinity special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a
ballot at the applicable meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote in person at your
company’s meeting, you must bring a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of the shares authorizing you to vote at the
meeting. For additional information, see “The Kemper Annual Meeting” and “The Infinity Special Meeting” beginning on pages 46 and 53 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, respectively.

Whether or not you plan to attend the Kemper annual meeting or Infinity special meeting, you are encouraged to vote your shares by
proxy as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: How can I vote the shares of Kemper common stock I hold through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan?
 

A: Participants in the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, who receive this joint proxy statement/prospectus in their capacity as holders of Kemper common
stock through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, are entitled to vote by one of the following methods:

 

 
•  Complete, sign and date the proxy card and return it by 1:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Wednesday, May 30, 2018 (the “401(k)

Deadline”);
 

 •  Call the toll-free number on the proxy card and follow the recorded instructions by the 401(k) Deadline;
 

 •  Access the proxy voting website identified on the proxy card and follow the instructions by the 401(k) Deadline.

If voting instructions for shares held pursuant to the 401(k) and Retirement Plan are provided prior to the 401(k) Deadline, the plan trustee will
confidentially vote such shares in accordance with the voting instructions. In accordance with the terms of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, if
voting instructions for shares held pursuant to the 401(k) and Retirement Plan are not provided prior to the 401(k) Deadline, the plan trustee will
vote such shares in the same proportion as all other shares voted in accordance with timely voting instructions provided to the trustee by all other
plan participants.

 
Q: What will happen if I abstain from voting, fail to vote or do not direct how to vote on my proxy?
 

A: For purposes of the Kemper stockholder proposals:
 

 

•  Approval of the share issuance proposal. Approval of the share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
at the Kemper annual meeting with respect to such proposal, provided that a quorum is present. Under the current rules and interpretive
guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast” on the share issuance proposal consist of votes “FOR” or “against,” as well as elections to abstain from
voting on the share issuance. As a result, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting on the share issuance proposal will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of the share issuance proposal. The failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his, hers
or its shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker,
trust or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the share
issuance proposal because these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”

 

 

•  Election of Nominees to the Kemper Board. Each Nominee will be elected to the Kemper Board by the affirmative vote of a majority of
votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting, provided that a quorum is present. As a result, a Nominee will be elected to the Kemper Board if
the number of shares voted “FOR” such Nominee exceeds the number of shares voted “AGAINST” such Nominee. For purposes of the
election of Nominees to the Kemper Board, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder
who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to
that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the
election of Nominees.

 

 
•  Approval of all other proposals at the Kemper annual meeting. Approval of each of (i) the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, (ii) the

non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for
fiscal year 2018 and (iii) the

non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as disclosed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting with respect to such
proposal, provided that a quorum is present. For purposes of these proposals, “votes cast” means votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” the proposal.
As a result, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other
nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of each of these proposals
at the Kemper annual meeting.

All properly submitted proxies received by Kemper before the Kemper annual meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being
exercised at the Kemper annual meeting will be voted at the Kemper annual meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no instructions were provided, (i) “FOR” the share issuance proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment
proposal, (iii) “FOR” the election of each of the Nominees, (iv) “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte
& Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 and (v) “FOR” the non-binding advisory
proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers.

For purposes of the Infinity shareholder proposals:
 

 

•  Approval of the merger proposal. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of Infinity shareholders entitled to exercise a
majority of the voting power of Infinity. Accordingly, an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder
who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to
that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record, or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.

 

 

•  Approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal. Approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Infinity special meeting with respect to such proposal, provided that a quorum is
present. Accordingly, an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds his or her shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other
nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the non-binding
compensation advisory proposal as these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast” with respect to the non-binding compensation
advisory proposal.

 

 

•  Approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal. Approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast at the Infinity special meeting with respect to such proposal, provided that a quorum is present. Accordingly,
an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a
bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record
or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal. In
addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the voting power of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy or by use of communications equipment at the Infinity special meeting may adjourn the
meeting to another place, date or time. In this case, an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal
to adjourn the meeting due to an absence of a quorum.

Table of Contents

All properly submitted proxies received by Infinity before the Infinity special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being
exercised at the Infinity special meeting will be voted at the Infinity special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no instructions were provided, “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and
“FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

Under the applicable stock exchange rules, matters subject to a stockholder vote are classified as “routine” or “non-routine.” In the case of “non-
routine” matters, a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record may not vote shares held in “street name” for which they have not
received instructions from the beneficial owner (referred to as “broker non-votes”), whereas they may vote those shares in their discretion in the
case of any “routine” matter. The non-binding advisory proposal submitted to Kemper stockholders to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche
LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 is a “routine” matter. All other proposals submitted to Kemper
stockholders and Infinity shareholders are “non-routine” matters. Accordingly, shares of Kemper common stock or Infinity common stock
held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record will NOT be voted by such bank, broker, trust or other
nominee holder of record on any of the proposals with respect to “non-routine” matters unless the beneficial owner of such shares has
properly instructed such bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record how to vote.

 
Q: Can I change or revoke my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
 

A: Yes. If you are a holder of record, you can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Kemper annual meeting or Infinity
special meeting by:

 

 
•  signing and delivering a new, valid proxy bearing a later date and, if it is a written proxy, signed and delivered to the attention of your

company’s Corporate Secretary;
 

 •  delivering a signed written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of your company at:
 
Kemper Corporation   Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation
One East Wacker Drive   2201 4th Avenue North
Chicago, Illinois 60601   Birmingham, Alabama 35203
Attention: Corporate Secretary   Attention: Corporate Secretary
 

 
•  calling the toll-free telephone number, or accessing the proxy voting website, identified on the proxy card and re-voting any time prior to

10:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the last business day preceding the applicable special meeting; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person, although your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy.

If your shares are held through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, you can change your vote by:
 

 •  delivering another signed proxy card with a later date anytime prior to the 401(k) Deadline;
 

 
•  calling the toll-free telephone number, or accessing the proxy voting website, identified on the proxy card and re-voting any time prior to the

401(k) Deadline.

If your shares are held in a “street name” account, you must contact your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.

 
Q: What should Kemper stockholders or Infinity shareholders do if they receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your

shares of Kemper common stock or Infinity common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card. In addition, if you are both a Kemper stockholder and an Infinity shareholder, you will receive one or more
separate proxy cards or voting instruction cards for each company. In each case, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card that you
receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

 
Q: Who will tabulate the votes for the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting, and how will Kemper stockholders and Infinity

shareholders find out the voting results after the respective meetings?
 

A: Representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Broadridge”) will tabulate the votes and act as inspectors of election at the Kemper
annual meeting and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”) will tabulate the votes and act as inspectors of election at the
Infinity special meeting. Kemper and Infinity will each report the voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC
within four business days after the vote taken at the Kemper annual meeting and the vote taken at the Infinity special meeting.

 
Q: If I am a Kemper stockholder or other interested party, how can I communicate with the Kemper Board?
 

A: Kemper stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Kemper Board, or with the non-management directors of the Kemper
Board as a group, by calling the Kemper Corporate Responsibility Hotline at 888.695.3359 or by submitting a report or inquiry online at
MyComplianceReport.com (enter access code KEMP). The hotline and the online reporting function are managed by an independent company,
and reports can be made anonymously or confidentially. Communications will be directed to the chair of Kemper’s Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee (described on page 59 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) if addressed to the non-management or independent
directors as a group.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, how do I make an election for the type of Merger Consideration that I prefer to receive?
 

A: Each holder of shares of Infinity common stock as of the close of business on the Infinity record date (other than shares owned by Kemper or any
of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares under Ohio law) will be mailed a form of election (“Form of Election”). These materials
will be mailed concurrently with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Each such Infinity shareholder should specify in the Form of Election
(i) the number of shares of Infinity common stock for which such shareholder elects to have exchanged for the Mixed Consideration, (ii) the
number of shares of Infinity common stock for which such shareholder elects to receive the Cash Consideration and (iii) the number of shares of
Infinity common stock for which such shareholder elects to have exchanged for the Stock Consideration. Any Infinity shareholder who does not
make an election will be deemed to have made an election to receive the Mixed Consideration. The consideration to be paid to Infinity
shareholders electing to receive only Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration is subject, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to
automatic proration to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of shares of Kemper common stock issued in the Merger is
approximately the same as what would be paid and issued if all Infinity shareholders were to receive the Mixed Consideration. No fractional
shares of Kemper common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Infinity shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Kemper common stock. The election will have been properly made only if the exchange agent has received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m.,
New York City, New York time, on the date that is ten (10) business days preceding the closing date (the “Election Deadline”) a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by (x) in the case of shares of Infinity common stock

represented by stock certificates, certificates representing shares of Infinity common stock, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable
for transfer on the books of Infinity or (y) in the case of book-entry shares held by holders of Infinity common stock, any documentation required
by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election.

 
Q: When can Infinity shareholders expect to receive the Merger Consideration?
 

A: If you hold physical stock certificates of Infinity common stock (other than shares owned by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or
Infinity or any of its subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares under Ohio law) and you do not make an election to receive the Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration or Mixed
Consideration by delivering to the exchange agent by the Election Deadline a properly completed Form of Election and your share certificates,
you will be sent a letter of transmittal as soon as reasonably practicable after the closing, describing how you may exchange your shares of Infinity
common stock for the Mixed Consideration, and the exchange agent will forward you the cash and the Kemper common stock in book entry form
(or applicable evidence of ownership) to which you are entitled, including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Kemper common stock, if any, after
receiving the proper documentation from you.

If you hold your shares of Infinity common stock in book-entry form, after the closing, you need only to deliver the Form of Election for your
shares to automatically be exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Kemper common
stock, if any.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, will I receive the Merger Consideration that I request on the Form of Election?
 

A: Not necessarily. The aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate number of shares of Kemper common stock to be paid and issued, respectively,
to Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement are fixed. Each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity
shareholder makes an election to receive the Mixed Consideration, and each share of Infinity common stock held by an Infinity shareholder who
fails to make any valid election with respect to such stockholder’s shares of Infinity common stock, will receive $51.60 in cash and 1.2019 shares
of Kemper common stock (subject to adjustment for any reclassification, stock split, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to
shares of Kemper common stock). However, if the elections of all Infinity shareholders electing to receive solely the Cash Consideration or the
Mixed Consideration (including all Infinity shareholders who fail to make a valid election with respect to their shares of Infinity common stock)
result in an oversubscription or undersubscription of the aggregate amount of cash available to be paid by Kemper to Infinity shareholders as
Merger Consideration, the aggregate amount of cash payable by Kemper in the Merger will not be increased or decreased. Similarly, if the
elections of all Infinity shareholders electing to receive solely the Stock Consideration or the Mixed Consideration (including all Infinity
shareholders who fail to make a valid election with respect to their shares of Infinity common stock) result in an oversubscription or
undersubscription of the aggregate number of shares of Kemper common stock available to be issued by Kemper to Infinity shareholders as
Merger Consideration, the aggregate number of shares of Kemper common stock to be issued by Kemper in the Merger will not be increased or
decreased. Rather, in each such case, the exchange agent will allocate between cash and Kemper common stock in the manner described in “The
Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Cash Consideration” and “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Stock Consideration”
beginning on pages 179 and 180, respectively, to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of shares of Kemper common
stock issued in the Merger is the same as what would be paid and issued if all Infinity shareholders were to receive the Mixed Consideration.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that an Infinity shareholder that has made a valid election to receive solely Cash Consideration or solely Stock
Consideration will receive the form of consideration elected with respect to the shares of Infinity common stock held by such shareholder.

Table of Contents

For detailed illustrations of the potential proration and adjustment of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration for those Infinity
shareholders electing to receive solely Cash Consideration or solely Stock Consideration, see “The Merger Agreement—Allocation of Merger
Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 180.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, what is the deadline for making an election?
 

A: Your election, to be properly made, must be received by Computer Share Trust Company, N.A., the exchange agent for the Merger (the “exchange
agent”) at its designated office by the Election Deadline, which is 5:00 p.m. New York City, New York, time on the date that is ten (10) business
days preceding the closing. Kemper and Infinity will publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least three (3) business days before
the anticipated Election Deadline.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, what happens if I do not send a Form of Election or it is not received by the Election Deadline?
 

A: If the exchange agent does not receive a properly completed Form of Election from you at or prior to the Election Deadline, then you will be
deemed to have elected to receive Mixed Consideration with respect to your shares of Infinity common stock. You bear the risk of delivery of the
Form of Election (including the risk of loss of any certificates representing shares of Infinity common stock) to the exchange agent.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, can I change my election after the Form of Election has been submitted?
 

A: Yes. You may revoke your election at or prior to the Election Deadline by submitting a written notice of revocation to the exchange agent.
Revocations must specify the name in which your shares are registered on the share transfer books of Infinity and any other information that the
exchange agent may request. If you wish to submit a new election, you must do so in accordance with the election procedures described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the Form of Election. If you instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to submit an
election for your shares, you must follow directions from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record for changing those
instructions. The notice of revocation must be received by the exchange agent at or prior to the Election Deadline in order for the revocation to be
valid.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, may I transfer shares of Infinity common stock after making an election?
 

A: Yes, but only if you revoke your election or the Merger Agreement is terminated. Once you properly make an election with respect to any shares
of Infinity common stock, you will be unable to sell or otherwise transfer those shares, unless you properly revoke your election or the Merger
Agreement is terminated.

 
Q: If I am an Infinity shareholder, may I transfer shares of Infinity common stock before the Infinity special meeting?
 

A: Yes. The Infinity record date is earlier than the Infinity special meeting and the date that the Merger is expected to be completed. If you transfer
your shares of Infinity common stock after the Infinity record date but before the Infinity special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the
Infinity special meeting, but you will have transferred the right to receive the Mixed Consideration, Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration,
each of which may only be received if you hold your shares through the closing.

 
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
 

A: If you have any questions about the Kemper annual meeting, the Infinity special meeting, the Merger or how to submit your proxy, or, for Infinity
shareholders, how to complete your Form of Election, or if you need

Infinity (see page 230)

Infinity’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “IPCC.”

Infinity offers personal and commercial auto insurance primarily in four key states: Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. Infinity’s target

other filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279.

The Merger (see page 122)

Kemper, Merger Sub and Infinity have entered into the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with applicable law,
Merger Sub will merge with and into Infinity, with Infinity surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper. Upon the closing,
Infinity common stock will no longer be publicly traded on NASDAQ. You are encouraged to read carefully the Merger Agreement in its entirety
because it is the legal document that governs the Merger. Kemper and Infinity currently expect that the Merger will be completed during the third
quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable conditions to the closing, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals
including approvals from insurance regulators. Following the Merger, Kemper and Infinity are referred to as the “combined company.”

Merger Consideration (see page 178)

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, as of the effective time, each share of Infinity common stock issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its
subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
under Ohio law) will be cancelled and convert into, at the election of the holder thereof, the right to receive either the Mixed Consideration, Cash
Consideration or Stock Consideration, in each case as described below, subject to the automatic proration and adjustment procedures described
under “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Cash Consideration” beginning on page 179, “The Merger Agreement—Merger
Consideration—Stock Consideration” beginning on page 180 and “The Merger Agreement—Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative
Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 180.

The consideration to be paid to Infinity shareholders electing to receive only Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration is subject, pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to automatic proration and adjustment, as applicable, to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the
total number of shares of Kemper common stock issued in the Merger is approximately the same as what would be paid and issued if all Infinity
shareholders were to receive the Mixed Consideration. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Kemper common stock to be issued and the total
amount of cash to be paid by Kemper as part of the Merger Consideration will not change from what was agreed to in the Merger Agreement (other
than for adjustment in

the event that there is any change in the outstanding shares or classes of capital stock of Kemper or Infinity as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or other similar transaction, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution that is declared thereon. However, since the market price of Kemper common stock will fluctuate, the total
value of the Mixed Consideration and the value of the Stock Consideration may increase or decrease between the date of the Merger Agreement
and the effective time. Accordingly, the value of the actual per share consideration to be paid to Infinity shareholders cannot be determined until
after the effective time. No fractional shares of Kemper common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Infinity shareholders will receive cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Kemper common stock.

Mixed Consideration

The Merger Agreement provides that each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity shareholder makes a valid
election to receive a fixed combination of cash and Kemper common stock, and each share for which an Infinity shareholder fails to make any
election with respect to such shareholder’s shares of Infinity common stock, will be converted into the right to receive the combination of (i)
$51.60 in cash and (ii) 1.2019 shares of Kemper common stock.

Cash Consideration

The Merger Agreement provides that each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity shareholder makes a valid
election to receive cash will be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $129.00, without interest and subject to any required
withholding of taxes, subject to the automatic proration and adjustment procedures described under “The Merger Agreement—Merger
Consideration—Cash Consideration” beginning on page179 and “The Merger Agreement—Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative
Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 180.

Stock Consideration

The Merger Agreement provides that each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity shareholder makes a valid
election to receive Kemper common stock will convert into the right to receive 2.0031 shares of Kemper common stock, subject to the automatic
proration and adjustment procedures described under “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Stock Consideration” beginning on page
180 and “The Merger Agreement—Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 180.

Treatment of Infinity Equity Awards in the Merger (see page 172)

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time:

Infinity performance share awards

Each award of Infinity performance share units with respect to Infinity common stock granted under an Infinity stock plan that is outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the effective time (“Infinity performance share awards”) will vest with respect to the target number of shares of
Infinity common stock subject to such Infinity performance share award (the “target share amount”) and will be converted into shares of Kemper
common stock (provided that any such shares of Kemper common stock held after payment of required withholding taxes may not be sold or
transferred prior to the first anniversary of the date of the closing), with the number of shares of Kemper common stock subject to each Infinity
performance share award determined by multiplying such target share amount by 2.0031.

Table of Contents

Director Restricted Shares

Each award of restricted shares of Infinity common stock granted under any Infinity stock plan that is outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the effective time (“Infinity restricted shares”) and held by a non-employee member of the Infinity Board (“Director Restricted Shares”)
will vest in full and be eligible to receive the Merger Consideration

Rollover RSUs

Each award of Infinity restricted shares (other than the Director Restricted Shares) will be cancelled without any acceleration of vesting and
in exchange Kemper will grant, as soon as practicable following the closing, a number of restricted stock units with respect to Kemper common
stock determined by multiplying the number of cancelled Infinity restricted shares by 2.0031 (“Rollover RSUs”) with such Rollover RSUs vesting
in accordance with any applicable award or other agreement between the recipient of such Rollover RSUs and Kemper (or an affiliate thereof).

Ownership of Kemper After the Merger

Based on the number of shares of common stock of Infinity outstanding on the Infinity record date, Kemper expects to issue or reserve for
issuance approximately 13.2 million shares of Kemper common stock in connection with the Merger (including shares of Kemper common stock
issuable to Infinity shareholders and shares of Kemper common stock issuable pursuant to certain Infinity equity-based awards). Based on this
number and the number of shares of Kemper common stock outstanding on the Kemper record date, upon the closing, pre-existing Kemper
stockholders and former Infinity shareholders would own approximately 80% and 20% of the outstanding shares of Kemper common stock,
respectively, immediately following the closing. The Merger will have no effect on the number of shares of Kemper common stock owned by
existing Kemper stockholders.

Share Ownership of Kemper’s and Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on the Kemper record date, directors and executive officers of Kemper and their affiliates owned and were entitled to
vote approximately 604,738 shares of Kemper common stock, collectively representing approximately 1.2% of the shares of Kemper common
stock outstanding on that date. Approval of the share issuance proposal by Kemper stockholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes
cast at the Kemper annual meeting with respect to the share issuance proposal, provided that a quorum is present. On February 13, 2018, all of
Kemper’s directors and then-employed named executive officers entered into Voting and Support Agreements with Infinity (“Kemper Voting and
Support Agreements”) pursuant to which, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, each director and named executive officer agreed
to vote or cause to be voted any shares of Kemper common stock of which they are the beneficial or record owner in favor of the share issuance
proposal. Kemper currently expects that Kemper’s executive officers not party to the Kemper Voting and Support Agreements will vote in favor of
the share issuance proposal, although they are under no obligation to do so. See “The Voting and Support Agreements—Kemper Voting and
Support Agreements” beginning on page     . A form of the Kemper Voting and Support Agreement is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

At the close of business on the Infinity record date, directors and executive officers of Infinity and their affiliates owned and were entitled to
vote approximately 314,379 shares of Infinity common stock, collectively representing 2.9% of the shares of Infinity common stock outstanding on
that date. Approval of the merger proposal by Infinity shareholders requires the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to exercise a majority of
the voting power of Infinity. On February 13, 2018, all of Infinity’s directors and then-employed named executive officers entered into Voting and
Support Agreements with Kemper (the “Infinity Voting and Support Agreements”) pursuant to which, among other things and subject to certain
exceptions, each director and named

Opinion of Kemper’s Financial Advisor (see page 146)

At a meeting of the Kemper Board held on February 13, 2018, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered to the Kemper
Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of February 13, 2018, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions
set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid by Kemper for all of the issued and outstanding shares
of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Kemper.

The full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, dated February 13, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex

advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Kemper Board in connection with its consideration
of the proposed Merger and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Kemper common stock
should vote with respect to the share issuance proposal or any other matter.

Pursuant to an engagement letter between Kemper and Goldman Sachs, Kemper has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs for its services in
connection with the transactions an aggregate fee of $13 million, all of which is contingent upon the closing.

Opinion of Infinity’s Financial Advisor (see page 156)

At the February 12, 2018 meeting of the Infinity Board, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”), financial advisor to Infinity,
rendered its oral opinion to the Infinity Board, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 13, 2018, to the effect that as of the date
of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion,
the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Infinity common stock (excluding Kemper and its affiliates).
Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion as to the proration and election procedures in the Merger Agreement.

The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated February 13, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex E and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A summary of Deutsche Bank’s opinion
is set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Infinity’s Financial Advisor”
beginning on page 156 and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was addressed to,
and for the use and benefit of, the Infinity Board in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Merger. Deutsche Bank did
not express an opinion, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of Infinity common stock
should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter, including whether any such holder should elect to receive the Mixed
Consideration, the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was limited to the fairness of the Merger
Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Infinity common stock (excluding Kemper and its affiliates) as of the date of
the opinion. The opinion did not address any other terms of the Merger or the Merger Agreement. Nor did the opinion address the terms
of any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection with the Merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the
merits of the underlying decision by Infinity to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative
transactions or business strategies.

Pursuant to an engagement letter between Infinity and Deutsche Bank, dated December 21, 2017, Infinity has agreed to pay Deutsche Bank a
transaction fee equal to 1% of the value of the aggregate consideration (as defined in the engagement letter), which equaled approximately
$13 million as of March 29, 2018, for its services as financial advisor to Infinity in connection with the Merger, of which $1.0 million became
payable upon the delivery of Deutsche Bank’s opinion and the remainder of which is contingent upon the closing.

Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 172)

When considering the Infinity recommendation, Infinity shareholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of Infinity have
certain interests in the Merger that may be different from or in addition to the interests of Infinity shareholders generally. The Infinity Board was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other things, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

Table of Contents

These interests include the following:
 

 
•  Infinity executive officers and directors hold outstanding shares of Infinity common stock, which will be treated like all other shares of

Infinity common stock in the Merger. See “Ownership of Infinity Common Stock” beginning on page 234.
 

 

•  Pursuant to the terms of certain letter agreements entered into between Kemper and each of Glen N. Godwin, Samuel J. Simon and
Robert H. Bateman, Messrs. Godwin, Simon and Bateman will continue to be employed pursuant to the terms of their respective
employment agreements, and the term of each such executive’s employment agreement shall be extended for a period of two (2) years
following the closing.

 

 

•  The letter agreements also provide that each of Messrs. Godwin, Simon and Bateman will be entitled to receive a retention bonus equal
to the cash severance benefit that he would have received under his current employment agreement with Infinity if his employment had
been terminated by Infinity immediately prior to the expiration of the term (as extended by the letter agreements) for a reason other than
“cause,” subject generally to the executive remaining in continuous employment with the combined company through the extended
term.

 

 

•  The letter agreements also provide that Kemper will, as soon as practicable after the closing, grant each of Messrs. Godwin, Simon and
Bateman a special award of time-based restricted stock units having a grant date value equal to $1,000,000. The special grant will vest
in full at the expiration of the applicable term, provided generally that the executive remains in continuous employment with the
combined company through such date.

 

 

•  In connection with the Merger, the Infinity Board approved the extension of Mr. Gober’s employment for a period commencing
March 1, 2018 through the effective time of the Merger. During such period, Mr. Gober will be paid a salary at a rate of $287,500 per
annum, payable in accordance with Infinity’s normal payroll practices. Mr. Gober will not be entitled to any other compensation in
respect of such period.

 

 

•  In connection with the Merger, the Infinity Board established the Term Sheet Committee (as described on page 126 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus), which included Samuel J. Weinhoff serving as Chairman of the committee and Victor T. Adamo, Richard J.
Bielen, Teresa A. Canida and James L. Weidner serving as the remaining members of the Term Sheet Committee. As compensation for
the Term Sheet Committee’s services throughout the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Infinity Board approved a payment to Mr. Weinhoff of $25,000 and to each other member of the Term Sheet
Committee of $20,000, to be paid in April 2018.

 

 
•  Certain directors and officers of Infinity will have rights to indemnification from Kemper after the effective time. See “The Merger

Agreement—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 172.

The Infinity Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in adopting the Merger Agreement and in
determining to recommend that Infinity shareholders adopt the Merger Agreement. See “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 172 for additional information about these interests.

Board of Directors of Kemper after the Merger (see page 177)

In connection with the Merger, Kemper has agreed to take all actions necessary to cause, as of the effective time, the election as a member of
the Kemper Board of one individual who is serving as a director of the Infinity Board as of February 13, 2018 or immediately prior to the closing.

elected by the Kemper Board shall be in the sole discretion of Kemper and shall comply with the policies of the Kemper Board’s Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, Kemper’s corporate governance guidelines, applicable laws and the NYSE’s rules and regulations.

Information about the current Kemper and Infinity directors and executive officers can be found in the documents listed under the heading
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279.

Listing of Kemper Common Stock and Delisting and Deregistration of Infinity Common Stock (see page 172)

Application will be made to have the shares of Kemper common stock to be issued in the Merger approved for listing on NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, where Kemper common stock currently is traded under the symbol “KMPR.” If the Merger is completed, Infinity
common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the “NASDAQ”) and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. As a
result, Infinity will no longer be publicly traded or file periodic reports with the SEC.

Dissenting Rights of Infinity Shareholders (see page 187)

Under Ohio law, if the merger proposal is approved by the Infinity shareholders, any holder of shares of Infinity common stock who does not
vote in favor of approving the merger proposal may be entitled to seek relief as a dissenting shareholder under Section 1701.85 of the Ohio General
Corporation Law (the “OGCL”), which includes the right to seek appraisal of the fair cash value of such holder’s shares as determined by the Court
of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, but only if such shareholder complies with the procedures of Ohio law applicable to the exercise of
the rights of a dissenting shareholder, including by delivering to Infinity a written demand with the information required by Section 1701.85(A)(4)
of the OGCL before the vote on the merger proposal. The appraised fair cash value of Infinity common stock could be more, the same as or less
than the Merger Consideration. See “The Merger Agreement—Dissenting Rights of Infinity Shareholders” and “Appraisal and Dissenters’ Rights”
beginning on pages 187 and 226, respectively.

SECTION 1701.85 OF THE OGCL, GOVERNING THE RIGHTS OF DISSENTING INFINITY SHAREHOLDERS, IS
ATTACHED IN ITS ENTIRETY AS ANNEX F TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. ANY INFINITY
SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE THE RIGHTS OF A DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER OR WHO WISHES TO
PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW ANNEX F CAREFULLY AND SHOULD CONSULT SUCH
SHAREHOLDER’S LEGAL ADVISOR, AS FAILURE TO TIMELY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION
1701.85 OF THE OGCL WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THOSE RIGHTS.

Merely not voting for the Merger will not preserve the right of Infinity shareholders to seek an appraisal of their shares of Infinity common
stock under Ohio law because a submitted proxy not marked “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the
non-binding compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal. Accordingly, the submission of a proxy not
marked “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” will result in the waiver of appraisal rights. Infinity shareholders who wish to exercise their appraisal rights
and hold shares in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record must instruct their bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder
of record to take the steps necessary to enable them to demand appraisal for their shares.

Table of Contents

The conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement may be waived by Kemper or Infinity, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. For a more detailed discussion of these matters, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning
on page 188. The condition that the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act has been
satisfied, as early termination of the waiting period was granted on March 12, 2018.

Regulatory Approvals; Materially Burdensome Condition (see page 164)

Kemper and Infinity have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including,
subject to certain limitations, (i) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and approvals from governmental
entities (including under the HSR Act and applicable insurance regulatory laws), (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, qualifications and approvals
from non-governmental third parties, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any governmental entity vacated or reversed (but excluding any lawsuits or legal proceedings brought by or against any applicable state
insurance regulator) and (iv) executing and delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary to consummate the Merger Agreement
and transactions contemplated thereby. On February 28, 2018, Kemper and Infinity each filed a notification and report form under the HSR Act
with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Early termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act was granted by the FTC on March 12, 2018.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Kemper or any of its subsidiaries will be obligated to, and neither Infinity nor any of its subsidiaries
will, without the prior written consent of Kemper, consent to, take or refrain from taking, or offer or commit or consent to take or refrain from
taking (i) any action that involves (A) making any divestiture or disposition of any portion of any business or assets, (B) licensing any portion of
any business or assets, (C) accepting or entering any consent decree or hold separate order or (D) placing any assets in trust, in each case by
Kemper, Infinity or any their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case except for such actions related to de minimis assets (with such assets

operational restriction or restriction on the payment or declaration of dividends, (B) making any capital commitment or capital guaranty or

subsidiaries or affiliates which, in each case and together with any other such action, would or would reasonably be expected to detract from the
benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Kemper and its subsidiaries as a result of the Merger (with such benefits measured on a scale relative
to Infinity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and to include Kemper’s ability to operate its business after giving effect to the Merger), or (iii) any
action that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect with respect to either Kemper or Infinity, after giving effect to the
Merger (with such materiality measured on a scale relative to Infinity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), in each case of the immediately
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), whether before or after the closing (any such action, a “materially burdensome condition”). See “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Complete the Merger” beginning on pages 188
and 201, respectively.

Financing (see page 210)

Kemper currently anticipates borrowing under its available credit facilities and/or incurring indebtedness under an unsecured bank loan to

Table of Contents

Prior to the effective time or the termination of the Merger Agreement, as the case may be, at Kemper’s sole expense, Infinity has agreed to,
and has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide, or cause to be provided by its and their respective
personnel and representatives, to Kemper such cooperation reasonably requested by Kemper in connection with the arrangement of any debt
financing obtained to fund the Merger Consideration. See “The Merger Agreement—Financing” beginning on page 210.

Infinity Acquisition Proposals (see page 191)

Subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement precludes Infinity, its directors and officers and their respective other representatives
from, among other things, soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging or knowingly inducing or facilitating the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer constituting or related to an Infinity acquisition proposal (as described on
page 193 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus). Notwithstanding such restrictions, the Merger Agreement provides that, at any time prior to
Infinity shareholders approving the merger proposal, provided that Infinity and its subsidiaries have complied with their non-solicitation
restrictions, the Infinity Board may, upon receiving an Infinity acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and
determining in good faith (after consultation with Infinity’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that such Infinity acquisition
proposal constitutes an Infinity superior proposal (as described on page 194 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), make an Infinity adverse
recommendation change (as described on page 193 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) and may cause Infinity to terminate the Merger
Agreement and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Infinity superior proposal if Infinity has taken certain actions
(as described under “The Merger Agreement—Infinity Acquisition Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement—Special Meeting of Infinity
Shareholders; Recommendation of the Infinity Board” beginning on pages 191 and 197, respectively).

Kemper Acquisition Proposals (see page 194)

Subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement precludes Kemper, its directors and officers and their respective other representatives
from, among other things, soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging or knowingly inducing or facilitating the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer constituting or related to a Kemper acquisition proposal (as described on
page 196 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus). Notwithstanding such restrictions, the Merger Agreement provides that, at any time prior to
Kemper stockholders approving the share issuance proposal, provided that Kemper and its subsidiaries have complied with their non-solicitation
restrictions, the Kemper Board may, upon receiving a Kemper acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and
determining in good faith (after consultation with Kemper’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that such Kemper acquisition
proposal constitutes a Kemper superior proposal (as described on page 196 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), make a Kemper adverse
recommendation change (as described on page 196 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) and may cause Kemper to terminate the Merger
Agreement and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Kemper superior proposal if Kemper has taken certain actions
(as described under “The Merger Agreement—Kemper Acquisition Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement— Annual Meeting of Kemper
Stockholders; Recommendation of the Kemper Board” beginning on pages 194 and 199, respectively).

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 216)

Termination by Kemper or Infinity

The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned prior to the effective time by the mutual written consent of
Kemper and Infinity. Moreover, either Kemper or Infinity may terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the effective time if:
 

 

•  any court of competent jurisdiction or other government entity has issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any
other action, restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the closing or any of the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement and such judgment, order, injunction, rule, decree or other action has become final and nonappealable
(provided that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement for this reason will not be available to any party that has failed to (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to contest, resolve or lift, as applicable, such judgment, order, injunction, rule, decree or other action and
(ii) comply with its obligations described in “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Complete the Merger” beginning on page 201 in all
material respects as its relates to such governmental entity);

 

 

•  the Infinity special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) was held to obtain the approval of the merger
proposal and concluded without obtaining such approval (provided that Infinity may not terminate the Merger Agreement for this
reason if Infinity has not complied with its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to not soliciting Infinity acquisition
proposals and the holding of the Infinity special meeting);

 

 

•  the Kemper annual meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) was held to obtain the approval of the share issuance
proposal and concluded without obtaining such approval (provided that Kemper may not terminate the Merger Agreement for this
reason if Kemper has not complied with its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to not soliciting Kemper acquisition
proposals and the holding of the Kemper annual meeting); or

 

 

•  the effective time has not occurred on or before November 13, 2018 (or, if extended pursuant to the Merger Agreement, February 13,
2019) (the “outside date”) (provided, that neither Kemper nor Infinity has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement for this reason if
the failure to consummate the Merger by such date results from the material breach or failure to perform by Kemper or Merger Sub (in
the case of termination by Kemper) or Infinity (in the case of termination by Infinity) of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement). See “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”
beginning on page 216.

Termination by Kemper

Kemper may terminate the Merger Agreement as follows:
 

 

•  if Infinity breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of the applicable conditions precedent to
Kemper’s obligation to complete the Merger and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within the lesser of (A) thirty (30) days after the
giving by Kemper of written notice to Infinity of such breach or failure to perform (such notice to describe such breach or failure to
perform in reasonable detail) and (B) the number of days remaining until the outside date, provided that Kemper will not have the right
to terminate the Merger Agreement for this reason if Kemper or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, obligations or agreements under the Merger Agreement;

 

 
•  if, prior to Infinity shareholders approving the merger proposal, the Infinity Board or any committee thereof has (i) effected or

permitted an Infinity adverse recommendation change (whether or not

permitted to do so under the terms of the Merger Agreement), (ii) adopted, approved, endorsed, declared advisable or recommended to
Infinity shareholders an Infinity acquisition proposal other than the Merger, (iii) failed to publicly reaffirm the Infinity recommendation
within five business days following receipt of a written request by Kemper to provide such reaffirmation after an Infinity acquisition
proposal has been publicly disclosed or has become publicly known, (iv) failed to include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the
Infinity recommendation or included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus any proposal to vote upon or consider any Infinity
acquisition proposal other than the Merger or (v) failed to recommend against a competing tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or
more of the outstanding capital stock of Infinity within ten (10) business days after commencement of such offer (including by taking
no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders);

 

 •  if Infinity breaches in any material respect any of its obligations with respect to not soliciting Infinity acquisition proposals; or
 

 

•  if, prior to Kemper stockholders approving the share issuance proposal, Kemper terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into
a definitive agreement to effect a Kemper superior proposal, so long as Kemper has complied with its obligations with respect to not
soliciting Kemper acquisition proposals in all material respects and enters into such definitive agreement concurrently with the
termination of the Merger Agreement and pays the termination fee (described below) in accordance with the procedures and within the
time periods set forth in the Merger Agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The
Merger Agreement—Reimbursement of Fees and Expenses” beginning on pages 216 and 218, respectively.

Termination by Infinity

Infinity may terminate the Merger Agreement as follows:
 

 

•  if Kemper or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of the applicable
conditions precedent to Infinity’s obligation to complete the Merger and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within the lesser of
(A) thirty (30) days after the giving by Infinity of written notice to Kemper of such breach or failure to perform (such notice to describe
such breach or failure to perform in reasonable detail) and (B) the number of days remaining until the outside date, provided that
Infinity will not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement for this reason if Infinity is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, obligations or agreements under the Merger Agreement;

 

 

•  if, prior to Kemper stockholders approving the share issuance proposal, the Kemper Board or any committee thereof has (i) effected or
permitted a Kemper adverse recommendation change (whether or not permitted to do so under the terms of the Merger Agreement), (ii)
adopted, approved, endorsed, declared advisable or recommended to Kemper stockholders a Kemper acquisition proposal, (iii) failed to
publicly reaffirm the Kemper recommendation within five business days following receipt of a written request by Infinity to provide
such reaffirmation after a Kemper acquisition proposal has been publicly disclosed or has become publicly known, (iv) failed to include
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the Kemper recommendation or included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus any proposal
to vote upon or consider any Kemper acquisition proposal or (v) failed to recommend against a competing tender offer or exchange

•  if, prior to Infinity shareholders approving the merger proposal, Infinity terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a
definitive agreement to effect an Infinity superior proposal, so long as Infinity has complied with its obligations with respect to not
soliciting Infinity acquisition proposals in all material respects and enters into such definitive agreement concurrently with the
termination of the Merger Agreement, and pays the termination fee (described below) in accordance with the procedures and within the
time periods set forth in the Merger Agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The
Merger Agreement—Reimbursement of Fees and Expenses” beginning on pages 216 and 218, respectively.

Reimbursement of Fees and Expenses (see page 218)

Kemper must pay Infinity a termination fee of $49,598,810 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances,
including (i) following a failure by Infinity or Kemper to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals, if in certain circumstances, Kemper enters into
a transaction with respect to a Kemper acquisition proposal concurrently with or within twelve (12) months of such termination, or (ii) if Infinity
terminates the Merger Agreement following a Kemper adverse recommendation change.

If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if Kemper or Infinity fail to obtain the requisite stockholder or
shareholder approvals, Kemper or Infinity may be required to reimburse the other party for its expenses incurred in connection with the Merger in
an aggregate amount not to exceed $14,171,089.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 166)

For U.S. holders (as described on page 167 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for
shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Infinity shareholders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences of the exchange of shares of Infinity common stock for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign
income and other tax laws). See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 166.

Accounting Treatment (see page 171)

Kemper will account for the acquisition of shares of Infinity common stock through the Merger under the acquisition method of accounting
for business combinations. In determining the acquirer for accounting purposes, Kemper considered the factors required under Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”) and determined that Kemper will be
considered the acquirer of Infinity for accounting purposes. Accordingly, Kemper’s cost to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Infinity
common stock will be allocated to Infinity’s acquired assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests based upon their estimated fair values. The
allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and is dependent upon estimates of certain valuations that are subject to change.

Table of Contents

Risk Factors (see page 38)

In evaluating the Merger, the Merger Agreement or the issuance of shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, you
should read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus and especially consider the factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors”
beginning on page 38.

Kemper’s Dividend Policy

Kemper has historically paid quarterly dividends and intends to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders. However, any
decision to pay dividends on its common stock will be at the discretion of the Kemper Board, which may determine not to declare dividends at all
or at a reduced amount. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Kemper relies on dividends from its insurance
subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders, and such insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory
restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations that limit their ability to declare and pay dividends. See “The Merger—Kemper’s Dividend
Policy” on page  164.

Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders and Infinity Shareholders (see page 241)

The rights of the Kemper stockholders are governed by Kemper’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, dated as of August 6, 2014 (the
“Kemper Charter”) and Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective August 6, 2014 (the “Kemper Bylaws”) as well as the Delaware General
Corporation Law (“DGCL”). The rights of the Infinity shareholders are governed by Infinity’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,
dated as of May 21, 2007 (the “Infinity Articles”) and Regulations, as amended and restated as of August 1, 2017, (the “Infinity Regulations”) as
well as the OGCL. Following the closing, the rights of the Infinity shareholders will be governed by the Kemper Charter and the Kemper Bylaws,
as well as the DGCL, and the former Infinity shareholders will have the same rights as Kemper stockholders. However, because the Kemper
Charter and Kemper Bylaws are different from the Infinity Articles and Infinity Regulations, and the DGCL is different from the OGCL, the rights
of Infinity shareholders will differ in some respects from the rights afforded to them prior to the Merger. Certain of these differences are described
in detail under “Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders and Infinity Shareholders” beginning on page 241.

Expenses (see page 222)

Generally, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, subject to the specific exceptions discussed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

The Kemper Annual Meeting (see page 46)

The Kemper annual meeting will be held at 8:00 a.m. local time, on Friday, June 1, 2018, at The Kemper Building, 20th floor, One East
Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601. Holders of Kemper common stock on the Kemper record date will be entitled to vote at the Kemper annual
meeting. In addition to the share issuance proposal and Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, Kemper stockholders will be asked at the Kemper
annual meeting:
 

 •  To elect the Nominees to the Kemper Board;
 

 
•  To consider and vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent

registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018; and
 

 
•  To consider and vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as

described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Presented below are Kemper’s and Infinity’s historical per share information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, and pro forma
combined per share information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma combined per share information for the
year ended December 31, 2017 is presented as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2017. The unaudited pro forma combined book value per
common share is presented as if the Merger had occurred on December 31, 2017.

The unaudited pro forma combined per share information is based on the historical financial statements of Kemper and Infinity and certain
assumptions and adjustments as discussed in the section entitled “Kemper Corporation and Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 255, including assumptions relating to the allocation of the
consideration paid for Infinity based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and may be revised.
There can be no assurance that such revisions will not result in material changes to the information presented. This unaudited pro forma combined
per share information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the operating results or financial position of
Kemper or Infinity would have been had the Merger and related transactions been completed at the beginning of the period or on the date indicated,

(1) Calculated by multiplying the last reported sale price of Kemper common stock by 1.2019 and adding $51.60 in cash, as Mixed

Consideration provided pursuant to the Merger Agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration” beginning on page 178.

The market value of the shares of Kemper common stock to be issued in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock upon the closing, if
applicable, will not be known at the time Infinity shareholders vote on the merger proposal or at the time Kemper stockholders vote on the share
issuance proposal. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the stock prices of either company before the Merger is
completed.

The above tables show historical stock price comparisons and the equivalent value of the Merger Consideration per share of Infinity common
stock at certain specified dates. Because the market prices of Kemper common stock and Infinity common stock will likely fluctuate prior to the
Merger, these comparisons may not provide meaningful information to Kemper stockholders in determining whether to approve the share issuance
proposal, or to Infinity shareholders in determining whether to approve the merger proposal. Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders are
encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Kemper common stock and Infinity common stock and to review carefully the other
information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus in
considering whether to approve the proposals before them. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279.

As of April 16, 2018, Kemper had 51,536,698 shares of its common stock outstanding, and there were approximately 3,400 holders of record
of Kemper common stock.

RISK FACTORS

The combined company will be faced with a market environment that cannot be predicted and that involves significant risks, many of which will be
beyond its control. In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should consider carefully the material
risks described below before deciding whether to vote for the proposals to be considered at the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting. You
should also read and consider the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the heading “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”
See also “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 279.

Risks Relating to the Merger and the Combined Company

The combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or such benefits
may take longer to realize than expected.

The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the
businesses of Kemper and Infinity as further described in “The Merger—Recommendation of the Kemper Board and Its Reasons for the Merger” and
“The Merger—Recommendation of the Infinity Board and Its Reasons for the Merger.” The combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated
benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on the ability of Kemper to integrate the businesses of Infinity with Kemper. The combination of
two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, the combined company will be required to devote significant
management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Kemper and Infinity. The integration process may disrupt the
business of either or both of the companies and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by Kemper and
Infinity. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully the operations of Kemper and Infinity or
otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities and business
operations of the combined company and could seriously harm its results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies may
result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of agent relationships and diversion of management’s
attention, and may cause the combined company’s stock price to decline. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among
others:
 

 •  unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the integration or the Merger;
 

 •  managing a significantly larger company;
 

 
•  the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters, and potential

disruption associated with the Merger;
 

 •  maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;
 

 •  integrating two unique business cultures, which may prove to be incompatible;
 

 •  the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;
 

 •  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;
 

 •  coordinating geographically separate organizations;
 

 •  unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;
 

 •  managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company; and
 

 
•  making any necessary modifications to internal financial control standards to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and

regulations promulgated thereunder.

Table of Contents

Many of these factors will be outside of the combined company’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the
amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact the combined company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of Kemper and Infinity are integrated successfully, the combined
company may not realize the full benefits of the transactions, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that the combined company
expects. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. As a result, Kemper and Infinity cannot assure you that the
combination of Infinity with Kemper will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

The price of Kemper common stock might decline prior to the closing, which would decrease the value of the Merger Consideration to be received by
Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Further, at the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting, Kemper stockholders
and Infinity shareholders will not know the exact value of Kemper common stock that will be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

The market price of Kemper common stock at the time the Merger is completed might increase or decrease significantly from the price on the date
of the Merger Agreement or from the price on the date of the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting. On February 12, 2018, the day prior
to the date of media publications regarding the proposed Merger, Kemper common stock closed at $57.75 per share as reported on the NYSE. From
February 13, 2018, through April 23, 2018, the trading price of Kemper common stock ranged from a closing high of $59.20 per share to a closing low
of $53.55 per share on the NYSE.

Upon the closing, Infinity shareholders will be entitled to receive for each share of Infinity common stock that they own, at the election of each
shareholder, consideration in the form of a combination of Kemper common stock and cash, only cash or only Kemper common stock. The proportion
of the consideration payable to holders of Infinity common stock in Kemper common stock is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the stock
prices of either company before the Merger is consummated. As a result, any changes in the market price of Kemper common stock will have a
corresponding effect on the market value of the Mixed Consideration and Stock Consideration. Neither party, however, has a right to terminate the
Merger Agreement based upon changes in the market price of Kemper or Infinity common stock.

Kemper and Infinity are working to complete the transactions as promptly as practicable. Kemper currently expects that the Merger will be
completed during the third quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the closing. Because the date when the transactions
are completed will be later than the date of the Kemper annual meeting and Infinity special meeting, Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders will
not know the exact value of the Kemper common stock that will be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement at the time they vote on the share issuance
proposal, in the case of Kemper stockholders, or on the merger proposal, in the case of Infinity shareholders. As a result, if the market price of Kemper
common stock upon the closing is lower than the market price on the date of the Infinity special meeting, the market value of the Mixed Consideration
and Stock Consideration received by Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be lower than the market value of the Mixed
Consideration and Stock Consideration at the time of the vote by the Infinity shareholders. Moreover, during the period between the Kemper annual
meeting and Infinity special meeting and the closing, events, conditions or circumstances could arise that could have a material impact or effect on
Kemper, Infinity or the industries in which they operate.

If the combined company is unable to manage its growth, its business and financial results could suffer.

The combined company’s future financial results will depend in part on its ability to profitably manage its core businesses, including any growth
that the combined company may be able to achieve. Over the past several years, each of Kemper and Infinity has engaged in the identification of, and
competition for, growth and expansion opportunities. In order to achieve those initiatives, the combined company will need to, among other things,
recruit, train, retain and effectively manage employees and expand its operations and financial control

systems. If the combined company is unable to manage its businesses effectively and profitably, its business and financial results could suffer.

To be successful, the combined company must retain and motivate key employees, including those experienced with post-acquisition integration, and
failure to do so could seriously harm the combined company.

The success of the combined company following the Merger largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of management and
other key personnel for each of Kemper and Infinity. As a result, to be successful, the combined company must retain and motivate executives and other
key employees. Certain specified management employees of Infinity have executed retention letters with Kemper to continue their employment for a
period of two (2) years following the Merger. However, certain key managers and functional area employees will continue to be at-will employees
following the Merger and there is no assurance that these individuals will remain with the combined company. If these personnel were to leave, the
combined company may experience increased difficulty in managing the ongoing business operations and integrating the businesses and may not be able
to adequately replace such personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s overall business, results of operations and
financial condition. Additionally, the combined company’s failure to retain key managers and employees will result in the roles and responsibilities of
such managers and employees to be filled either by existing or new personnel, which may require the combined company to devote time and resources
to identifying, hiring and integrating replacements for the departed managers and employees that could otherwise be used to integrate the businesses of
Kemper and Infinity or otherwise pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to retain and
motivate its employees in the same manner as Kemper and Infinity.

Kemper and Infinity may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent
the Merger from being completed.

Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even
if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse
judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on Kemper’s and Infinity’s respective liquidity and financial condition.
Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the closing, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from
being consummated, which may adversely affect Kemper’s and Infinity’s respective business, financial position and results of operation. Currently,
neither Kemper nor Infinity is aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the Merger.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot
be met.

Before the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may be completed, various clearances, approvals and
declarations of non-disapproval must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities as described in “The Merger—Regulatory
Approvals” beginning on page 164. These regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such
conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying the closing or of imposing additional costs or limitations
on the combined company following the Merger. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion and may
contain conditions on the closing. However, if any such conditions impose a materially burdensome condition, Kemper and Merger Sub will not be
obligated to complete the Merger. In addition, the respective obligations of each of Kemper, Merger Sub and Infinity to complete the Merger are
conditioned on the receipt of certain regulatory approvals or waiver by the other party of such condition.

Table of Contents

Certain directors and executive officers of Infinity have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Infinity
shareholders.

Certain directors and executive officers of Infinity have interests in the Merger that are in addition to their interests as Infinity shareholders
generally. For executive officers, these interests include, but are not limited to, continued employment with the combined company and the treatment in
the Merger of Infinity performance share awards, Director Restricted Shares and Infinity restricted shares held by certain directors and executive
officers, as applicable (including accelerated vesting of the Infinity performance share awards and Director Restricted Shares, each immediately upon
the effective time). At the request of Kemper, three (3) executive officers of Infinity have also entered into retention letter agreements with Kemper
pursuant to which each such executive has indicated his intent to enter into employment with Kemper following the closing in exchange for the
compensation specified in his respective retention letter agreement. In addition, one individual who was serving on the Infinity Board as of February 13,
2018 or immediately prior to the effective time, with such individual being selected by Kemper in its sole discretion, will become a director of the
combined company. The Infinity Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and
in determining to recommend that Infinity shareholders adopt the merger proposal. See “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” on page 172.

The combined company will record goodwill and intangible assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its results of operations and
financial condition.

Accounting standards in the United States require that one party to the Merger be identified as the acquirer. In accordance with these standards, the
Merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of Infinity by Kemper and will follow the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
The assets and liabilities of Infinity will be consolidated with those of Kemper. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of Infinity’s assets
and liabilities, if any, will be recorded as goodwill. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 reflects $511.8
million of goodwill and $349.9 million of intangible assets resulting from the Merger, which are based on Kemper management’s preliminary fair value
estimates and are subject to change, including due to fluctuations in the market value of Kemper common stock as discussed in Note 5 to the “Kemper
Corporation and Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.”

The combined company will be required to assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. In the future the combined
company may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment. Any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of the
combined company’s goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect the combined company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The market price of the common stock of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those affecting the market price for
shares of Infinity common stock or for shares of Kemper common stock.

Upon the closing, holders of Infinity common stock will become holders of Kemper common stock. Kemper’s business differs from that of
Infinity, and the business of the combined company will differ from that of Kemper. Accordingly, the results of operations for the combined company
will be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Infinity and may be affected by factors different from
those currently affecting the results of operations of Kemper. For a discussion of the businesses of Kemper and of certain factors to consider in
connection with those businesses, see the see the section entitled “Information About Kemper and Merger Sub” and the documents incorporated by
reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.” For a discussion of
the businesses of Infinity and of certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the section entitled “Information About Infinity.”
See also the section entitled “Summary—Comparative Per Share Market Price Data and Dividend Information” for additional information on the market
value of shares of Kemper common stock and Infinity common stock.

Table of Contents

The issuance of shares of Kemper common stock to Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Infinity Merger Agreement will reduce the percentage
ownership interests of Kemper’s pre-existing stockholders. Based on the number of shares of common stock of Infinity outstanding on the Infinity
record date, Kemper expects to issue or reserve for issuance approximately 13.2 million shares of Kemper common stock in connection with the Merger
(including shares of Kemper common stock issuable to Infinity shareholders and shares issuable pursuant to certain of Infinity’s equity-based awards).
Based on this number and the number of shares of Kemper common stock outstanding on the Kemper record date, upon the closing, pre-existing
Kemper stockholders and former Infinity shareholders would own approximately 80% and 20% of the outstanding shares of Kemper common stock,
respectively, immediately following the closing. The Merger will have no effect on the number of shares of Kemper common stock owned by existing
Kemper stockholders. The issuance of approximately 13.2 million shares of Kemper common stock to Infinity shareholders and holders of equity-based
incentive awards will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interests of current Kemper stockholders in earnings, voting, liquidation
value and book and market value. See “Summary—Ownership of Kemper After the Merger.”

Infinity shareholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what they elect.

While each holder of Infinity common stock may elect to receive, in connection with the Merger, the Mixed Consideration, Cash Consideration or
Stock Consideration, the total amount of cash and the total number of shares of Kemper common stock available for all Infinity shareholders will be
fixed. Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other Infinity shareholders, even if a holder of Infinity common stock elects to receive all cash
in connection with the Merger, such holder may ultimately receive a portion of the consideration in Kemper common stock and if a holder of Infinity
common stock elects to receive all Kemper common stock in connection with the Merger, such holder may receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration in cash. See “The Merger Agreement—Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” for more
information. If a holder of Infinity common stock does not submit a properly completed and signed Form of Election to the exchange agent by the
Election Deadline, then such stockholder will have no control over the type of Merger Consideration such stockholder may receive and will receive
Mixed Consideration consisting of both cash and Kemper common stock. No fractional shares of Kemper common stock will be issued in the Merger,
and all Infinity shareholders, regardless of their election, will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Kemper common stock.

If you deliver shares of Infinity common stock to make an election, you will not be able to sell those shares unless you revoke your election prior to
the Election Deadline.

If you are a holder of Infinity common stock and want to elect to receive the Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration in exchange for your
shares, you must deliver to the exchange agent by the Election Deadline a properly completed Form of Election. Following the delivery of a completed
Form of Election, you will not be able to transfer such shares unless you revoke your election before the Election Deadline by providing written notice
to the exchange agent. If you do not revoke your election before the Election Deadline, you will not be able to liquidate your investment in Infinity
common stock for any reason until you receive the Merger Consideration.

The opinions of Kemper’s and Infinity’s financial advisors will not reflect changes in circumstances between the original signing of the Merger
Agreement on February 13, 2018 and the closing.

Kemper and Infinity each received opinions from their respective financial advisors as of February 13, 2018 and do not expect to receive updated
fairness opinions prior to the closing. Changes in the operations and prospects of Kemper or Infinity, general market and economic conditions and other
factors that may be beyond the control of Kemper or Infinity, and on which Kemper’s and Infinity’s financial advisor’s opinions were based, may
significantly alter the value of Kemper or the prices of the shares of Infinity’s common stock or Kemper common stock by the time the Mergers are
completed. The opinions do not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. Because

advisors will not be updating their opinions, which were issued in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, the opinions will not address
the fairness of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view at the time the Mergers are completed. The Kemper Board’s recommendation
that Kemper stockholders vote “FOR” the share issuance proposal and the Infinity Board’s recommendation that Infinity shareholders vote “FOR” the
merger proposal, however, are current as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinions that Infinity and Kemper
received from their respective financial advisors, please refer to “The Merger—Opinion of Kemper’s Financial Advisors” and “The Merger—Opinion of
Infinity’s Financial Advisor.”

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Infinity for greater Merger Consideration
or from trying to acquire Kemper.

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to Infinity, both
during the pendency of the proposed Merger with Kemper as well as afterward should the Merger with Kemper not be consummated, that might result in
greater value to Infinity shareholders than the Merger with Kemper. These Merger Agreement provisions include a general prohibition on Infinity from
soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing
transactions. In addition, Infinity may be required to pay Kemper a termination fee in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for
competing transactions. For further information, please see “The Merger Agreement—Infinity Acquisition Proposals,” “The Merger Agreement—
Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Reimbursement of Fees and Expenses.”

The Merger Agreement also contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to Kemper,
both during the pendency of the proposed Merger with Infinity as well as afterward and should the Merger with Infinity not be consummated, that might
result in greater value to Kemper stockholders than the Merger. These Merger Agreement provisions include a general prohibition on Kemper from
soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing
transactions. In addition, Kemper may be required to pay Infinity a termination fee in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for
competing transactions. For further information, please see “The Merger Agreement—Infinity Acquisition Proposals,” “The Merger Agreement—
Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement—Reimbursement of Fees and Expenses.”

Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock prices and future businesses and financial results of Kemper and Infinity.

If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Kemper and Infinity may be adversely affected and Kemper and Infinity will be subject
to several risks and consequences, including the following:
 

 
•  Infinity may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Kemper a termination fee of $49,598,810 or reimburse Kemper’s documented

fees and expenses up to $14,171,089 under the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  Kemper may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Infinity a termination fee of $49,598,810 or reimburse Infinity’s documented

fees and expenses up to $14,171,089 under the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  Kemper and Infinity will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as such as

legal, accounting and other costs incurred in connection with the Merger;
 

 
•  under the Merger Agreement, each of Kemper and Infinity is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing

the Merger that may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and

Table of Contents

 
•  matters relating to the Merger may require substantial time and resources by Kemper and Infinity, including time and resources devoted to

planning integration activities, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Kemper
and Infinity as independent companies.

In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Kemper and Infinity may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their
respective agents, policyholders, employees and business partners. Kemper and Infinity also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to
complete the Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Kemper or Infinity to perform their respective obligations under the Merger
Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, Kemper and Infinity cannot assure their stockholders and shareholders, respectively, that the risks described
above will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of Kemper and Infinity.

The shares of Kemper common stock to be received by Infinity shareholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights than shares of
Infinity common stock.

Following the closing, Infinity shareholders receiving the Stock Consideration will become Kemper stockholders and their rights will be governed
by the Kemper Charter, the Kemper Bylaws and the DGCL. The rights associated with Kemper common stock are different from the rights associated
with Infinity common stock. See “Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders and Infinity Shareholders” beginning on page 241 for a discussion of
the different rights associated with Kemper common stock and Infinity common stock.

Kemper and Infinity will incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with the Merger.

Kemper and Infinity expect to incur a number of costs associated with completing the Merger and integrating the operations of the two companies.
The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses resulting from the Merger and will consist of transaction costs related to the
Merger, including costs to compensate financial advisors for their services, facilities and systems consolidation and integration costs and employment
related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Kemper and Infinity. Although Kemper and Infinity
expect that the elimination of redundant costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, will offset
incremental transaction and Merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.

The announcement and pendency of the Merger may adversely affect Kemper’s and Infinity’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

The announcement and pendency of the business combination may cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding Kemper’s and Infinity’s
business, which could negatively affect certain relationships with agents, employees, policyholders and business partners, regardless of whether the
Merger is consummated.

Table of Contents

Kemper currently anticipates that the Merger will be accretive to Kemper’s earnings per share in 2019, excluding Value of Business Acquired
(“VOBA”) and one-time items, and is expected to be accretive to Kemper’s earnings per share in 2020 by more than 10%, excluding restructuring and
one-time items. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. The combined company could also encounter
additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Merger. All of these
factors could cause dilution to the combined company’s earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and cause a
decrease in the price of the combined company’s common stock.

Risks Relating to Kemper

Kemper is, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in Part I, Item 1A in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More

Table of Contents

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote

Only holders of Kemper common stock at the close of business on April 16, 2018 (the “Kemper record date”), will be entitled to notice of, and to
vote at, the Kemper annual meeting. At the close of business on the Kemper record date, there were 51,536,698 shares of Kemper common stock issued
and outstanding. Accordingly, 51,536,698 shares of Kemper common stock are eligible to be voted at the Kemper annual meeting. Each holder of
Kemper common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Kemper common stock owned as of the Kemper record date.

A list of Kemper’s registered shareholders as of the close of business on April 16, 2018 will be available for inspection at the Kemper annual
meeting and for a period of ten (10) days prior to June 1, 2018 during ordinary business hours at Kemper’s executive offices located at One East Wacker
Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601.

Vote Required; Quorum; Adjournment

The holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of Kemper common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Kemper annual meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the Kemper annual meeting. A quorum must be present
before stockholders can vote on any of the proposals at the Kemper annual meeting. All shares of Kemper common stock represented at the Kemper
annual meeting, including abstentions and broker non-votes, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum.
The Chairman of the Kemper annual meeting is entitled to adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time whether or not a quorum is present.

Vote required to approve the share issuance proposal. Approval of the share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting with respect to the share issuance proposal, provided that a quorum is present. Under the current rules
and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast” on the share issuance proposal consist of votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” as well as elections to
abstain from voting on the share issuance proposal. As a result, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting on the share issuance
proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of this proposal. The failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or
other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the share issuance
proposal because these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”

Vote required to elect of Nominees to the Kemper Board. Each Nominee will be elected to the Kemper Board by the affirmative vote of a majority
of votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting, provided that a quorum is present. As a result, a Nominee will be elected to the Kemper Board if the
number of shares voted “FOR” such Nominee exceeds the number of shares voted “AGAINST” such Nominee. For purposes of the election of
Nominees to the Kemper Board, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or
other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the election of Nominees.

Vote required to approve of all other proposals at the Kemper annual meeting. Approval of each of (i) the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal,
(ii) the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for
fiscal year 2018 and (iii) the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as disclosed in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting with respect to
such proposal, provided that a quorum is present. For purposes of these proposals, “votes cast” means votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” each
proposal. As a result, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting

Table of Contents

instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect
on the approval of the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal and the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s
named executive officers at the Kemper annual meeting. However, because the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte &
Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 is a “routine” matter, Kemper does not expect there to be
any broker non-votes with respect to this proposal as banks, brokers, trusts or other nominee holders of record are permitted to vote in their
discretion without receiving instructions from beneficial holders of Kemper common stock.

If a quorum is not present at the Kemper annual meeting, or if there are not sufficient votes in favor of the share issuance proposal, Kemper
expects that the Kemper annual meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies by the Chairman of the Kemper annual meeting or, subject to
approval of the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast at the Kemper annual meeting, by the
Kemper stockholders. At any subsequent reconvening of the Kemper annual meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would
have been voted at the original convening of the Kemper annual meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior
to the subsequent meeting.

Voting by Kemper’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Kemper record date for the Kemper annual meeting, the directors, named executive officers and executive officers of Kemper as a group
owned and were entitled to vote approximately 604,738 shares of Kemper common stock, or approximately 1.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Kemper common stock on that date. On February 13, 2018, all of Kemper’s directors and then-employed named executive officers entered into Voting
and Support Agreements with Infinity, pursuant to which such directors and named executive officers have agreed to vote or cause to be voted any
shares of Kemper common stock for which they are the beneficial or record owners for the approval of the share issuance proposal and against any
competing proposal or other proposal, action or transaction that would reasonably be expected to in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the
issuance of shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or the Merger.

Accordingly, Kemper currently expects that each of its directors and named executive officers entitled to vote at the Kemper annual meeting and
party to the Voting and Support Agreements with Infinity will vote their shares of Kemper common stock “FOR” the share issuance proposal and
“FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Holders of Kemper common stock as of the Kemper record date may vote by proxy or in person at the Kemper annual meeting. Votes cast by
proxy or in person at the Kemper annual meeting will be tabulated and certified by Broadridge, which shall serve as the inspector of election for the
Kemper annual meeting.

Voting in Person

Kemper stockholders who plan to attend the Kemper annual meeting and who own shares of Kemper common stock in their own name on the
Kemper record date may vote in person at the Kemper annual meeting by written ballot or by delivering a signed proxy card. Kemper stockholders who
hold their shares through the Kemper Corporation 401(k) and Retirement Plan as set forth below (the “401(k) and Retirement Plan”) must vote such
shares by the 401(k) Deadline (as defined below) and, accordingly, may not vote such shares in person at the Kemper annual meeting. Kemper
stockholders who hold their shares in “street name,” which means such shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of
record, must present written evidence at the Kemper annual meeting from the institution holding such shares indicating that such Kemper stockholder
was the beneficial owner of the shares held in street name on the Kemper record date and is

Table of Contents

authorized to vote such shares in person. This written evidence is generally called a “Legal Proxy” and should be submitted to Kemper’s Secretary, C.
Thomas Evans, Jr., prior to the commencement of the Kemper annual meeting.

Voting by Proxy; Voting Shares of Kemper Common Stock held through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan by Proxy

The vote of each Kemper stockholder is very important. Accordingly, holders of Kemper common stock as of the Kemper record date should vote
by proxy by:
 

 •  completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope;
 

 
•  calling the toll-free number specified on the enclosed proxy card and following the recorded instructions to vote at any time prior to 10:59

p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the last business day preceding the Kemper annual meeting; or
 

 
•  accessing the proxy voting website identified on the enclosed proxy card and following the instructions to vote at any time prior to 10:59

p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the last business day preceding the Kemper annual meeting.

Kemper stockholders should submit their proxy even if they plan to attend the Kemper annual meeting. Kemper stockholders can change their
vote at the Kemper annual meeting. Voting instructions are included on the enclosed proxy card. If a Kemper stockholder properly submits a proxy to
Kemper in time to vote, one of the individuals named as a proxy in such Kemper stockholder’s proxy will vote the shares as such Kemper stockholder
has directed.

The method of voting by proxy differs for shares held as a record holder and shares held in “street name.” If a Kemper stockholder holds shares of
Kemper common stock in “street name,” the Kemper stockholder will receive instructions from such stockholder’s bank, broker, trust or other nominee
holder of record that the Kemper stockholder must follow in order to vote such stockholder’s shares. Such bank, broker, trust or other nominee may
allow such Kemper stockholder to deliver voting instructions over the Internet, by telephone or by mail.

Unless Kemper stockholders give their banks, brokers, trusts or other nominee holders of record instructions on how to vote their shares of
Kemper common stock, their banks, brokers, trusts and other nominees will not be able to vote their shares on either of the proposals at the Kemper
annual meeting.

All properly executed proxies that are received prior to the Kemper annual meeting and that are not revoked will be voted at the Kemper
annual meeting according to the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions are indicated, they will be voted (i) “FOR” the share
issuance proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, (iii) “FOR” the election of each of the Nominees, (iv) “FOR” the
non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal
year 2018 and (v) “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Holders of Kemper common stock through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan should vote by proxy by:
 

 
•  completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope by 1:00 am

Central Daylight Time on Wednesday, May 30, 2018, (the “401(k) Deadline”);
 

 •  calling the toll-free number specified on the enclosed proxy card and following the recorded instructions by the 401(k) Deadline; or

Table of Contents

 •  accessing the proxy voting website identified on the enclosed proxy card and following the instructions by the 401(k) Deadline.

If voting instructions for shares held pursuant to the 401(k) and Retirement Plan are provided prior to the 401(k) Deadline, the plan trustee will
confidentially vote such shares in accordance with the voting instructions. In accordance with the terms of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, if voting
instructions for shares held pursuant to the 401(k) and Retirement Plan are not provided prior to the 401(k) Deadline, the plan trustee will vote such
shares in the same proportion as all other shares voted in accordance with timely voting instructions provided to the trustee by all other plan participants.

Revocation of Proxy

A Kemper stockholder and any holder of shares of Kemper common stock through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan may revoke a proxy or change
the voting instructions by taking any of the following actions:

Shares held as a registered Kemper stockholder:
 

 •  delivering another signed proxy card with a later date anytime prior to the commencement of the Kemper annual meeting;
 

 
•  notifying Kemper’s Secretary, C. Thomas Evans, Jr., in writing prior the commencement of the Kemper annual meeting that such

stockholder has revoked its proxy;
 

 •  signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares of Kemper common stock and bearing a later date;
 

 
•  calling the toll-free telephone number, or accessing the proxy voting website, identified on the proxy card and re-voting any time prior to

10:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time on the last business day preceding the Kemper annual meeting; or
 

 
•  attending the Kemper annual meeting and delivering a new, signed proxy card or ballot to one of the ushers when requested to do so,

although attendance at the Kemper annual meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

Shares of Kemper common stock held through the 401(k) and Retirement Plan:
 

 •  delivering another signed proxy card with a later date anytime prior to 401(k) Deadline; or
 

 
•  calling the toll-free telephone number, or accessing the proxy voting website, identified on the proxy card and re-voting any time prior to the

401(k) Deadline.

If a Kemper stockholder’s shares are held in “street name,” such stockholder should contact the institution holding such stockholder’s shares to
determine the procedures, if any, for revoking or changing such stockholder’s voting instructions.

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of Kemper proxies with respect to shares held of record
should be addressed to:

Chicago, Illinois 60601
Attention: Secretary

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

An abstention, which occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting, will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the share issuance approval. However, an

abstention will not affect the results of the vote on any of the other proposals submitted to Kemper stockholders at the Kemper annual meeting.

Under the applicable stock exchange rules, matters subject to stockholder vote are classified as “routine” or “non-routine.” In the case of “non-
routine” matters, a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record may not vote shares held in “street name” for which they have not received
instructions from the beneficial owner (referred to as “broker non-votes”), whereas they may vote those shares in their discretion in the case of any
“routine” matter. The non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public
accountant for fiscal year 2018 is a “routine” matter. All other proposals submitted to Kemper stockholders, including (i) the share issuance proposal,
(ii) the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal, (iii) the election of the Nominees to the Kemper Board and (iv) the non-binding advisory proposal to
approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, as described in this joint proxy statement prospectus, are “non-routine” matters.
Accordingly, shares of Kemper common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record will NOT be
voted by such bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record on any of the proposals with respect to “non-routine” matters unless the
beneficial owner of such shares has properly instructed such bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record how to vote.

The failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote or to instruct such stockholder’s bank, broker, or other nominee holder of record to vote if such
stockholder’s shares are held in “street name” will not affect the results of any of the proposals submitted to Kemper stockholders at the Kemper annual
meeting, other than the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public
accountant for fiscal year 2018.

Proxy Solicitation

Kemper has retained the services of Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) to aid in the solicitation of proxies and will pay Innisfree a base
fee of $30,000 for these services, plus its related costs and expenses. Kemper will bear the total expense of soliciting proxies from Kemper stockholders,
except that Infinity and Kemper have each agreed to share equally all expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and the related proxy materials. In addition to the amounts paid to Innisfree and the amounts paid for the solicitation of
proxies by mail, Kemper will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation materials. Although the
principal distribution of proxy materials will be through the Internet, solicitation of proxies will also be made by mail. Additional proxy solicitation may
be made by telephone or other direct communication with certain stockholders or their representatives by Kemper’s directors, officers and employees,
who will receive no additional compensation for such solicitation.

Householding

Any Kemper stockholder that shares an address with another Kemper stockholder and received multiple copies of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus may contact Kemper as described below and request that a single copy be sent to the stockholder’s address for future deliveries of
Kemper communications. This is commonly referred to as “householding.” If a Kemper stockholder’s joint proxy statement/prospectus was
“householded” but such stockholder prefers to receive separate copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus, additional copies may be requested by
contacting Kemper as follows:
 

 •  contact Kemper Investor Relations by telephone at 312.661.4930, or by e-mail at investors@kemper.com; or
 

 •  write to Kemper Investor Relations at One East Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, Attention: Investor Relations.

THE INFINITY SPECIAL MEETING

General

The Infinity Board is furnishing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to solicit proxies to be voted at Infinity’s special meeting. The joint proxy
statement/prospectus summary below highlights information contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please read the entire joint
proxy statement/prospectus carefully before voting as it provides Infinity shareholders with important information they need to know to be able to vote,
or instruct their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote, at the Infinity special meeting.

Special Meeting of Infinity Shareholders

Date: June 1, 2018

Time: 8:00 am local time

Location: Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, 2201 4th Avenue, North Birmingham, Alabama 35203.

Voting Matters and Board Recommendations

1. To consider and vote upon the merger proposal; and

2. To consider and vote upon the non-binding compensation advisory proposal; and

3. To consider and vote upon the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

Pursuant to the Infinity Regulations, the business to be transacted at the Infinity special meeting shall be limited to the proposals set forth in the
notice to the Infinity shareholders provided with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendation of the Infinity Board

After careful consideration, on February 13, 2018, the Infinity Board unanimously adopted resolutions approving the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement. The Infinity Board unanimously recommends that Infinity shareholders vote for “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the non-
binding compensation advisory proposal, and “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal at the Infinity special meeting.

For a summary of the factors considered by the Infinity Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, as well as the Infinity Board’s reasons for approving, and certain risks related to, the Merger, see “The Merger—Recommendation
of the Infinity Board and Its Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 143.

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote

Only holders of Infinity common stock at the close of business on April 20, 2018 (the “Infinity record date”), will be entitled to notice of, and to
vote at, the Infinity special meeting. At the close of business on the Infinity record date, there were 10,941,936 shares of Infinity common stock issued
and outstanding. Accordingly, 10,941,936 shares of Infinity common stock are eligible to be voted at the Infinity special meeting. Each holder of
Infinity common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Infinity common stock owned as of the Infinity record date.

Table of Contents

A list of Infinity’s registered shareholders as of the close of business on April 20, 2018 will be available for inspection at the Infinity special
meeting and for a period of ten (10) days prior to June 1, 2018 during ordinary business hours at Infinity’s executive offices located at 2201 4th Avenue
North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203.

Vote Required; Quorum; Adjournment

The holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of Infinity common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Infinity special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy or by use of communications equipment, shall constitute a quorum for the Infinity
special meeting. A quorum must be present before a vote can be taken on (i) the merger proposal, (ii) the non-binding compensation advisory proposal
and (iii) the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

Vote required to approve the merger proposal. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of Infinity shareholders entitled to
exercise a majority of the voting power of Infinity. Accordingly, an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Infinity
shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions
to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record, or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.

Vote required to approve the non-binding compensation advisory proposal. Approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Infinity special meeting with respect to the non-binding compensation advisory proposal,
provided that a quorum is present. For purposes of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal, “votes cast” means votes “FOR” or
“AGAINST” the proposal. As a result, an Infinity shareholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds
his or her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker,
trust or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the non-
binding compensation advisory proposal.

Vote required to approve the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal. Approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Infinity special meeting with respect to the meeting adjournment proposal, provided that a
quorum is present. For purposes of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal, “votes cast” means votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” the proposal. As a
result, an Infinity shareholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name”
through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of
record or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal. In
addition, even if a quorum is not present at the Infinity special meeting, the affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the voting power
of the shares present in person or represented by proxy or by use of communications equipment at the Infinity special meeting may adjourn the
meeting to another place, date or time. In this case, an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adjourn the meeting due to an absence of a quorum.

Voting by Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Infinity record date for the Infinity special meeting, the directors, named executive officers and executive officers of Infinity and their
affiliates as a group owned and were entitled to vote approximately 314,379 shares of Infinity common stock, or approximately 2.9% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Infinity common stock on that date. On February 13, 2018, all of Infinity’s directors and then-employed named executive officers
entered into Voting and Support Agreements with Kemper, pursuant to which such directors and named executive officers have agreed to vote or cause
to be voted any shares of Infinity common stock for which they are the beneficial or record owners for the approval of the merger proposal and against
any competing proposal or other proposal, action or transaction that would reasonably be expected to in any manner impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify
the approval of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents

Accordingly, Infinity currently expects that each of its directors and named executive officers entitled to vote at the Infinity special meeting and
party to the Voting and Support Agreements with Kemper will vote their shares of Infinity common stock “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the non-
binding compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Holders of Infinity common stock as of the Infinity record date may vote by proxy or in person at the Infinity special meeting. Votes cast by proxy
or in person at the Infinity special meeting will be tabulated and certified by AST, which shall serve as the inspector of election for the Infinity special
meeting.

Voting in Person

Infinity shareholders who plan to attend the Infinity special meeting and who own shares of Infinity common stock in their own name on the
Infinity record date may vote in person at the Infinity special meeting by written ballot or by delivering a signed proxy card. Infinity shareholders who
hold their shares in “street name,” which means such shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record, must present
written evidence at the Infinity special meeting from the institution holding such shares indicating that such Infinity shareholder was the beneficial
owner of the shares held in street name on the Infinity record date and is authorized to vote such shares in person. This written evidence is generally
called a “Legal Proxy” and should be submitted to Infinity’s Secretary, James H. Romaker, prior to the commencement of the Infinity special meeting.

Voting by Proxy

The vote of each Infinity shareholder is very important. Accordingly, holders of Infinity common stock as of the Infinity record date should vote
by proxy by:
 

 •  completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope;
 

 
•  calling the toll-free number specified on the enclosed proxy card and following the recorded instructions to vote at any time prior to 10:59

p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the last business day preceding the Infinity special meeting; or
 

 
•  accessing the proxy voting website identified on the enclosed proxy card and following the instructions to vote at any time prior to 10:59

p.m., Central Daylight Time, on the last business day preceding the Infinity special meeting.

Infinity shareholders should submit their proxy even if they plan to attend the Infinity special meeting. Infinity shareholders can change their vote
at the Infinity special meeting. Voting instructions are included on the enclosed proxy card. If an Infinity shareholder properly submits a proxy to
Infinity in time to vote, one of the individuals named as a proxy in such Infinity shareholder’s proxy will vote the shares as such Infinity shareholder has
directed.

The method of voting by proxy differs for shares held as a record holder and shares held in “street name.” If an Infinity shareholder holds shares
of Infinity common stock in “street name,” the Infinity shareholder will receive instructions from such shareholder’s bank, broker, trust or other nominee
that the Infinity shareholder must follow in order to vote such shareholder’s shares. Such bank, broker, trust or other nominee may allow such Infinity
shareholder to deliver voting instructions over the Internet, by telephone or by mail.

Unless Infinity shareholders give their banks, brokers, trusts or other nominee holders of record instructions on how to vote their shares of Infinity
common stock, their banks, brokers, trusts and other nominees will not be able to vote their shares on either of the proposals at the Infinity special
meeting.

Table of Contents

All properly executed proxies that are received prior to the Infinity special meeting and that are not revoked will be voted at the Infinity
special meeting according to the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions are indicated, they will be voted “FOR” the merger
proposal, “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory and “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

Revocation of Proxy

An Infinity shareholder may revoke a proxy or change the voting instructions by taking any of the following actions:
 

 •  delivering another signed proxy card with a later date anytime prior to the commencement of the Infinity special meeting;
 

 
•  notifying Infinity’s Secretary, James H. Romaker, in writing prior the commencement of the Infinity special meeting that such shareholder

has revoked its proxy;
 

 •  signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares of Infinity common stock and bearing a later date;
 

 
•  calling the toll-free telephone number, or accessing the proxy voting website, identified on the proxy card and re-voting any time prior to

10:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time on the last business day preceding the Infinity special meeting; or
 

 
•  attending the Infinity special meeting and delivering a new, signed proxy card or ballot to one of the ushers when requested to do so,

although attendance at the Infinity special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

If an Infinity shareholder’s shares are held in “street name,” such shareholder should contact the institution holding such shareholder’s shares to
determine the procedures, if any, for revoking or changing such shareholder’s voting instructions.

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of Infinity proxies with respect to shares held of record
should be addressed to:

Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation
2201 4th Avenue North
Birmingham, Alabama 35203
Attention: Corporate Secretary

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

An abstention, which occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting, will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, but will have no effect on the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and the Infinity meeting
adjournment proposal.

Under applicable stock exchange rules, the merger proposal, the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and the Infinity meeting
adjournment proposal are “non-routine” matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the special meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held
by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record has
not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal.
Accordingly, shares of Infinity common stock held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record will NOT be voted by
such bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record on any of the proposals, and such shares will NOT be counted in determining the presence of
a quorum at the Infinity special meeting, unless the holder of such shares has properly instructed such bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of
record how to vote.

Table of Contents

The failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote or to instruct such shareholder’s bank, broker, or other nominee holder of record to vote if such
shareholder’s shares are held in “street name” will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, but not affect the results of the non-
binding compensation advisory proposal or the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

Proxy Solicitation

Infinity has retained the services of D.F. King & Co., Inc. (“DF King”) to aid in the solicitation of proxies and will pay DF King a base fee of
$20,000 for these services, plus its related costs and expenses. Infinity will bear the total expense of soliciting proxies from Infinity shareholders, except
that Infinity and Kemper have each agreed to share equally all expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the related proxy materials. In addition to the amounts paid to DF King and the amounts paid for the solicitation of proxies by
mail, Infinity will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation materials. Although the principal
distribution of proxy materials will be through the Internet, solicitation of proxies will also be made by mail. Additional proxy solicitation may be made
by telephone or other direct communication with certain shareholders or their representatives by Infinity’s directors, officers and employees, who will
receive no additional compensation for such solicitation.

Householding

Any Infinity shareholder that shares an address with another Infinity shareholder and received multiple copies of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus may contact Infinity as described above and request that a single copy be sent to the shareholder’s address for future deliveries of
Infinity communications. This is commonly referred to as “householding.” If an Infinity shareholder’s joint proxy statement/prospectus was
“householded” but such shareholder prefers to receive separate copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus, additional copies may be requested by
contacting Infinity’s Secretary to request additional copies.

Other Business; Adjournments

No business other than the merger proposal, the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal shall
be conducted at the Infinity special meeting.

Assistance

If an Infinity shareholder needs assistance in completing such shareholder’s proxy card or has questions regarding the Infinity special meeting,
such shareholder should contact DF King, which is assisting Infinity with the solicitation of proxies, at (800) 706-3274 (toll-free) or (212) 269-5550
(bank/brokers).

Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors

The four principal standing committees of the Kemper Board include: (i) the Audit Committee; (ii) the Compensation Committee; (iii) the
Investment Committee; and (iv) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Kemper Board has adopted written charters for each of the
committees. These documents are available on Kemper’s website at kemper.com under Governance and/or by mail at no cost upon request to Kemper at
One East Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, Attention: Investor Relations.

Under Kemper’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Policy on Director Attendance at Annual Meetings, directors of the Kemper Board are
expected to attend the following types of meetings: (i) Kemper’s annual stockholder meetings; (ii) Kemper Board meetings; and (iii) Kemper Board
committee meetings for the committees on which they serve, unless unavoidable obligations or other circumstances prevent their attendance. Each
incumbent director attended at least 83 percent of the 2017 meetings of the Kemper Board and Kemper Board committees on which he or she served.
The non-employee and independent members of the Kemper Board meet regularly in executive sessions. In addition, each of the directors who was a
member of the Board on the date of the 2017 annual meeting of Kemper stockholders attended such meeting.

The following table shows the current membership (“M”) and chair (“C”) of the Kemper Board and each of the four principal Kemper Board

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee of the Kemper Board (the “Audit Committee”) assists the Kemper Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with
respect to the:
 

 •  integrity of Kemper’s financial statements;
 

 •  Kemper’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;
 

 •  independent registered public accountant’s qualifications, independence and performance; and

Table of Contents

retention and oversight of Kemper’s independent registered public accountant, including prior approval of the audit engagement fees and terms. The
Audit Committee is also responsible for, among other matters, reviewing and discussing with management Kemper’s financial statements and
disclosures, internal controls, internal audit function, and major risk exposures and steps taken by management to monitor and control such exposures,
including its enterprise risk management (“ERM”) structure and program.

The Kemper Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent and financially literate in accordance with the NYSE
Listed Company Manual (“NYSE Listing Standards”) and meets the independence requirements for audit committee membership under the rules of the
SEC. In addition, the Kemper Board has determined that Mr. Cochran, the Audit Committee chair, is qualified as an audit committee financial expert
under the SEC rules.

Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee of the Kemper Board (the “Compensation Committee”) assists the Kemper Board in fulfilling its responsibilities
relating to:
 

 
•  reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of Kemper’s Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) and

evaluating the CEO’s performance and compensation in light of such goals and objectives;
 

 
•  overseeing the compensation of Kemper’s executive officers and other members of senior management as may be designated by the

Compensation Committee from time to time;
 

 •  reviewing and approving Kemper’s incentive compensation and equity-based compensation plans;
 

 
•  reviewing and approving the material terms of any employment agreements or severance or change-in-control arrangements involving any

of Kemper’s executive officers; and
 

 •  reviewing and making recommendations to the Kemper Board on non-employee director compensation.

The Kemper Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is independent in accordance with the NYSE Listing
Standards. Additional information about the Compensation Committee’s governance is provided below in the section entitled “Discussion Of Kemper
Compensation Committee Governance” beginning on page 79.

Investment Committee

The Investment Committee of the Kemper Board (the “Investment Committee”) oversees Kemper’s investment objectives and policies and
reviews the performance of Kemper’s investment portfolio on a consolidated basis. The Investment Committee is also responsible for reviewing and
approving the policies and objectives for Kemper’s investment activities that are established and maintained by Kemper’s Chief Investment Officer.

NCG Committee

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Kemper Board (the “NCG Committee”) assists the Board in fulfilling its
responsibilities with respect to:
 

 
•  identifying potential candidates qualified to become Kemper Board members and recommending director nominees to the Kemper Board in

connection with each annual meeting of stockholders;
 

 •  developing and assessing principles and guidelines for corporate governance, executive succession, business conduct and ethics;
 

 •  leading the Kemper Board in its annual review of the performance of the Kemper Board and Kemper Board committees; and

Table of Contents

 
•  recommending to the Kemper Board director nominees, chairs for each Kemper Board committee and a Kemper Board member to serve as

Chairman of the Kemper Board.

The Kemper Board has determined that each member of the NCG Committee is independent in accordance with the NYSE Listing Standards.

Corporate Governance

The Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, charters for Kemper Board committees and other corporate
governance information can be found on Kemper’s website at www.kemper.com under Governance. Copies of these documents may also be obtained
free of charge by request to Kemper at One East Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, Attention: Investor Relations.

Selection of Board Nominees

In accordance with its charter, the NCG Committee recommends a slate of director nominees for election each year at the annual meeting of
Kemper stockholders. As needed to fill actual or anticipated vacancies on the Kemper Board, the NCG Committee screens and interviews candidates,
and conducts inquiries into each candidate’s background, qualifications and independence in accordance with the NYSE Listing Standards and SEC
rules. The NCG Committee may, in its discretion, retain recruiters to identify and evaluate director candidates.

Kemper will also consider director recommendations by stockholders that are made in writing, addressed to Kemper’s Secretary, and include:
(i) the candidate’s name, address and telephone number; (ii) a brief biographical description of the candidate, including his or her occupation for the last
five years and a statement of the qualifications of the candidate to serve as director; and (iii) the candidate’s signed consent to serve as a director if
elected and to be named in Kemper’s proxy materials as a director nominee. The NCG Committee will consider stockholder recommendations using the
same standards it uses to assess all other candidates for director.

The NCG Committee evaluates potential nominees for director against the following standards that were previously adopted by the Kemper
Board, as well as other attributes and skill sets considered desirable or necessary to address particular needs from time to time:
 

 •  the highest ethical standards and integrity;
 

 •  willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to the work of the Kemper Board;
 

 •  willingness and ability to represent the interests of stockholders as a whole rather than those of special interest groups;
 

 •  no conflicts of interest that would interfere with performance as a director;
 

 •  a reputation for working constructively with others;
 

 •  a history of achievement at a high level in business or the professions that reflects superior standards; and
 

 •  qualities that contribute to the Kemper Board’s diversity.

The primary focus in recruitment and nomination of directors has been on skills and experience. Other than as noted in the last bullet point above,
the NCG Committee does not have a specific policy or requirement with regard to its consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, nor has
it attempted to define or limit the concept of “diversity” to any particular set of characteristics. The NCG Committee and the Kemper Board believe that
the Kemper Board should be comprised of members with complementary and diverse skills and experience which, collectively, contribute breadth of
perspective and enable the Kemper Board to be an effective overseer of a publicly-traded insurance organization.

Related Person Transactions

The Kemper Board has adopted a written policy for the review, approval and ratification of transactions involving Kemper and “related persons”
(directors, executive officers, stockholders owning 5 percent or more of Kemper common stock, or immediate family members of any of the foregoing)
(the “Policy on Related Person Transactions”). The Policy on Related Person Transactions covers any related person transaction unless it involves: (i) a
transaction generally available to all employees of Kemper; (ii) less than $120,000 in the aggregate; or (iii) a relationship as an insurance policyholder
entered and maintained in the ordinary course of business of a subsidiary of Kemper on terms no more favorable to the related person than those
applicable to non-affiliated third parties or those generally available to employees of Kemper. Covered related person transactions must be approved or
ratified by the NCG Committee. In addition, approval under the Policy on Related Person Transactions is required before Kemper can make charitable
contributions exceeding $120,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year to a charitable organization for which a related person serves as an executive
officer, director, trustee or in a similar capacity.

Upon learning of a proposed or existing related person transaction requiring review under the Policy on Related Person Transactions, management
is required to submit the matter for consideration to the NCG Committee, which will review the transaction and make a determination as to whether it is
consistent with the best interests of Kemper and its stockholders. In its review, the NCG Committee considers the facts and circumstances it deems
significant and relevant to the particular transaction, including such factors as the related person’s relationship to Kemper and interest in the transaction,
the value of the transaction and any reasonable alternatives, and the potential impact of the transaction on Kemper, the related person and other
applicable parties. No director who is on the NCG Committee will participate in the review or approval under the Policy on Related Person Transactions
of a transaction involving such director or a member of his or her immediate family.

In accordance with the Policy on Related Person Transactions, the NCG Committee has reviewed certain transactions with Kemper involving
Fayez Sarofim & Co. (“FS&C”), a registered investment advisory firm. Christopher Sarofim, a member of the Kemper Board, is Vice Chairman and a
member of the board of directors of FS&C. Fayez Sarofim, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, a director and the majority shareholder of
FS&C, was a member of the Kemper Board until his retirement on May 1, 2013, and is the beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of the issued and
outstanding shares of Kemper common stock. Pursuant to an agreement entered into between FS&C and Kemper’s tax-qualified defined benefit pension
plan (the “Pension Plan”), FS&C provides investment management services with respect to certain Pension Plan funds. At December 31, 2017, the
Pension Plan had $171.8 million in assets managed by FS&C. Under the agreement, FS&C is entitled to fees calculated and payable quarterly based on
the fair market value of the assets under management. During 2017, the Pension Plan incurred investment expenses of $0.9 million under the agreement.
The agreement governing these services may be terminated by either party at any time on 30 days advance written notice. Kemper believes that the
services described above have been provided on terms no less favorable to Kemper than could have been negotiated with non-affiliated third parties.

Director Independence

The Kemper Board has adopted categorical standards (the “Director Independence Standards”) to assist in its determination of director
independence as required by Section 303A of the NYSE Listing Standards and applicable SEC rules. The Director Independence Standards are posted
under Governance on Kemper’s website at www.kemper.com. Under the Director Independence Standards, a director is not independent for purposes of
his or her service on the Kemper Board or a particular Kemper Board committee unless the director and his or her immediate family members meet all
independence requirements applicable to such service under the NYSE Listing Standards and SEC rules. The Director Independence Standards
incorporate by reference certain relationships listed in the NYSE and SEC independence rules. In addition, the Director Independence Standards define
four specific types of relationships as categorically immaterial. Two of these types of relationships involve an organization or entity that either received
charitable contributions from Kemper or engaged in transactions with Kemper, in either case to the extent the annual amounts involved did not exceed
$120,000. The other two

Table of Contents

types of relationships are: (i) status as an insurance policyholder of a Kemper subsidiary in the ordinary course of business of the subsidiary on terms no
more favorable to the director than those applicable to policies with unaffiliated third parties or those generally available to Kemper employees; and
(ii) the receipt by a director of administrative support or retirement compensation for prior service from a former employer of such director that has a
business relationship with Kemper. The Kemper Board believes that these specified types of relationships would not affect or influence Kemper’s
business relationships or create a direct or indirect material interest in Kemper’s business transactions on the part of a director.

In connection with its annual independence assessment of the individuals recommended by the NCG Committee as nominees for election to the
Kemper Board at the Kemper annual meeting, the Kemper Board considered the applicable independence rules and the factual information derived from
the questionnaires and affirmations completed by the individual directors and other available information. The Kemper Board affirmatively determined
that, under the NYSE Listing Standards, applicable SEC rules and the Director Independence Standards, Mses. Cronin and Whiting and Messrs.
Cochran, Geoga, Goldstein, Johnson, Joyce and Storch are each independent directors with no material relationships with Kemper and, as a result, that a
majority of the members of the Kemper Board are independent.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

The Kemper Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is independent in accordance with the NYSE Listing
Standards. The Compensation Committee consists of Mses. Cronin and Whiting and Messrs. Geoga, Goldstein, Johnson and Storch. None of these
individuals is a current or former officer or employee of Kemper or any of its subsidiaries, and none of these individuals had a relationship with Kemper
during 2017 that required disclosure by Kemper under the SEC rules on transactions with related persons. No executive officer of Kemper has served as
a director or member of the compensation committee or other board committee of another entity that had an executive officer who served on the
Compensation Committee or the Kemper Board.

Board Leadership and Role in Risk Oversight

The Kemper Board Leadership Structure

The current Kemper Board structure includes a Chairman of the Kemper Board and four principal board committees. The Audit Committee,
Compensation Committee and NCG Committee are comprised entirely of independent directors; the Investment Committee is comprised of two
independent directors, another non-employee director and the CEO.

The Kemper Board has no set policy on whether the offices of the Chairman of the Kemper Board and CEO should be held by the same person
and believes the combination or separation of these offices should be determined by the circumstances of Kemper and the composition of the Kemper
Board. Until November 2015, the Chairman and CEO positions were held by the same individual, a structure that served Kemper well under its
leadership at the time. The Chairman of the Kemper Board now serves as the primary liaison between non-employee directors and the CEO, although all
non-employee directors are encouraged to communicate freely with the CEO and other members of management at any time. In addition, the Chairman
of the Kemper Board sets agendas for, and presides over, Kemper Board meetings and the executive sessions of non-employee directors.

Kemper believes that its leadership structure is appropriate for Kemper given the role of the Chairman and current membership of the Kemper
Board. In addition to the leadership provided by the Chairman and general oversight of Kemper provided by the full Kemper Board, all non-employee
and independent directors meet regularly in executive session, and significant functions are provided by the key Kemper Board committees and the
independent outside advisors those committees use in their discretion.

The Kemper Board’s Role in Risk Oversight

The Kemper Board plays an active role in the oversight of risk assessment and management at various levels of the Kemper Board’s leadership
structure. The Kemper Board and Kemper Board committee meetings provide the directors with regular opportunities to discuss key matters and raise
questions with management, auditors and any consultants retained by the Kemper Board or its committees. The Kemper Board is regularly informed by
members of Kemper’s executive and operational management about a wide range of matters that could pose significant risks to Kemper. These include,
for example, strategic plans, corporate transactions, and significant operational projects and developments. In addition, Kemper Board committees have
the opportunity to evaluate areas of potential risk on issues pertinent to their particular functional responsibilities.

The Audit Committee has oversight responsibilities pertaining to a number of matters that involve potential risk to Kemper, most notably,
Kemper’s financial reporting and internal controls, ERM functions, the internal audit function, matters reported through Kemper’s Corporate
Responsibility Hotline, guidelines and policies regarding financial risk assessment and management, and the performance of Kemper’s independent
auditors. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviews, for example, Kemper’s quarterly and annual financial statements and
related SEC disclosures and auditor’s reports and communications, ERM structure and program, major risk exposures (including risks associated with
catastrophe losses) and management assessments and controls, and internal audit plans and significant findings. In addition, the Audit Committee
receives regular updates on Kemper’s information security program, cybersecurity risks and related developments. The Compensation Committee has
oversight responsibilities pertaining to Kemper’s executive compensation and equity-based compensation programs. In carrying out these
responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation risk assessments, performance metrics and results under Kemper’s cash incentive
and equity-based compensation plans and levels of ownership of Kemper common stock by its executives.

Board meeting and each Kemper Board committee meeting attended on a day when the full Kemper Board did not meet.

(2) An annual deferred stock unit (“DSU”) award covering shares of Kemper common stock with a grant date value of $110,000 is automatically
granted at the conclusion of each annual meeting of Kemper stockholders to each non-employee director under Kemper’s 2011 Omnibus Equity
Plan (the “Kemper Plan”).

The non-employee directors are eligible to defer up to 100 percent of the fees earned for service on the Kemper Board and Kemper Board
committees under the Kemper Corporation Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“Deferred Compensation Plan”). See “Executive Officer
Compensation and Benefits—Deferred Compensation Plan” beginning on page 109.

Table of Contents

The DSUs granted to non-employee directors give the holder the right to receive one share of Kemper common stock for each DSU issued and are
fully vested on the date of grant. Holders of DSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents in cash in the amount and at the time that dividends would
have been payable if the DSUs were shares of Kemper common stock. Conversion of the DSUs into shares of Kemper common stock is deferred until
the date the holder’s service on the Kemper Board terminates.

All directors on the Kemper Board are entitled to reimbursement for travel expenses incurred in attending Kemper Board and Kemper Board
committee meetings and other Kemper business. Each of Kemper’s directors, including any director who is also a member of management, is a party to
an indemnification and expense advancement agreement with Kemper, as permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The provisions of these
agreements are substantially the same as the indemnification provisions applicable to the directors under the Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws,
except that the agreements may not be amended or terminated without the written consent of the respective director.

Effective in the second quarter of 2018, the Kemper Board increased the annual retainer for the Chairman of the Kemper Board to $165,000.

Director Compensation Table

The following table shows the compensation earned by directors on the Kemper Board in 2017 based on the annual non-employee director
compensation program in effect for 2017. The specific amount of fees earned and awards granted differs for individual directors based on the particular

KEMPER PROPOSAL 1: SHARE ISSUANCE PROPOSAL

As discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Kemper stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve the
issuance of shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “share issuance proposal”).

Kemper common stock is listed on the NYSE, and, as such, Kemper is subject to the rules and regulations of the NYSE, including NYSE Listed
Company Manual Section 312.03(c). In order to comply with the rules and regulations of the NYSE and to satisfy conditions under the Merger
Agreement, Kemper stockholders are being asked to approve the share issuance proposal.

The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that Kemper stockholders vote “FOR” the share issuance proposal.

If a Kemper stockholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such stockholder’s proxy card, such
stockholder’s shares of Kemper common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the share issuance proposal.

The approval by Kemper stockholders of the share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal,
provided that a quorum is present.

Under the current rules and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, a Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting on the share issuance
proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of this proposal. However, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or
her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other
nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the share issuance proposal because
these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”

KEMPER PROPOSAL 2: MEETING ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

Kemper stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the Kemper annual meeting to a later date or time, but for no longer than
twenty (20) business days in the aggregate, for the absence of a quorum or to allow reasonable additional time to solicit proxies in favor of the share
issuance proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Kemper annual meeting to approve the share issuance proposal (the “Kemper meeting
adjournment proposal”).

The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that Kemper stockholders vote “FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal.

If a Kemper stockholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such stockholder’s proxy card, such
stockholder’s shares of Kemper common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal.

The approval by Kemper stockholders of the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast
on such proposal, provided that a quorum is present. The approval by Kemper stockholders of the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal is not a
condition to the closing.

A Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through
a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record or any
other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of this proposal.

The Chairman of the Kemper annual meeting is entitled to adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time if a quorum is not present. At any
subsequent reconvening of the Kemper annual meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would have been voted at the
original convening of the Kemper annual meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent
meeting.

KEMPER PROPOSAL 3: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Kemper stockholders will be asked to elect the Nominees to the Kemper Board. Directors serve for a term of one year or until the election of their
successors, or as otherwise provided under the Kemper Bylaws. If any of the Nominees for election to the Kemper Board at the Kemper annual meeting
named below declines or is unable to serve as a director (which is not anticipated), the individuals designated as proxies on the proxy card reserve full
discretion to vote for any or all other persons who may be nominated. A Nominee will be elected if the number of votes cast “FOR” exceeds the number
of votes cast “AGAINST” his or her election.

The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the election of each of the Nominees.

If a Kemper stockholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such stockholder’s proxy card, such
stockholder’s shares of Kemper common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the election of each of the Nominees.

The election of each Nominee requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast, provided that a quorum is present, meaning that the
number of shares voting “FOR” a Nominee exceeds the number of shares voted “AGAINST” a nominee. A Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain
from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of
record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record or any other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will
have no effect on the election of Nominees.

The election of the Nominees to the Kemper Board is not a condition to the closing.

Business Experience of Nominees

The NCG Committee considers and recommends candidates for election to the Kemper Board. Each of the individuals selected to serve as a
Nominee meets the standards for Kemper Board nominees described in the section entitled “Kemper Corporate Governance—Selection of the Kemper
Board Nominees” beginning on page 60. The NCG Committee and the Kemper Board believe that each Nominee has demonstrated significant business
achievements, ethical principles and commitment to serve Kemper and its stockholders, and that the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and
skills of each Nominee add to the collective ability of the Kemper Board to perform its duties and discharge its responsibilities with competence,
professionalism and expertise.

The following is a summary of the background of and public-company directorships held by each Nominee over at least the past five years, as

KEMPER PROPOSAL 4: NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO RATIFY SELECTION OF
KEMPER’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT

Kemper stockholders will be asked to vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s
independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018.

The Audit Committee considered the performance and qualifications of Deloitte & Touche LLP and has reappointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to
serve as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018, and the Kemper Board is asking Kemper stockholders to ratify that
selection. Under applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and
oversight of Kemper’s independent registered public accountant. The Kemper Board believes that stockholder ratification of the appointment of the
independent registered public accountant, while not legally required, represents good governance practice in light of the significance of the independent
registered public accountant’s role in the process of ensuring the integrity of Kemper’s financial statements.

The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on Kemper, the Kemper Board or the Audit Committee. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast with respect to the non-binding advisory proposal is required to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s
independent registered public accountant for the 2018 fiscal year, provided a quorum is present. In the event that the appointment is not ratified, the
Audit Committee will consider whether the appointment of a different independent registered public accountant would better serve the interests of
Kemper and its stockholders. Despite stockholder ratification, the Audit Committee may appoint a new independent registered public accountant at any
time if it determines in its sole discretion that such appointment is appropriate and in the best interests of Kemper and its stockholders.

It is expected that representatives from Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Kemper annual meeting. Such representatives may make a
statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of
Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018.

If a Kemper stockholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such stockholder’s proxy card, such
stockholder’s shares of Kemper common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the
selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018.

The approval by Kemper stockholders of the non-binding advisory proposal to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s
independent registered public accountant for fiscal year 2018 is not a condition to the closing.

A Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting will have no effect on the approval of this proposal. Kemper does not expect there to be
any broker non-votes with respect to this proposal as the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant
for fiscal year 2018 is a “routine” matter on which a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record is permitted to vote without instructions from
the beneficial owner.

Audit Committee Report

This report concerns the Audit Committee and its activities regarding Kemper’s financial reporting and auditing processes. The role of the Audit
Committee is one of oversight, and does not include conducting audits or determining whether the financial statements are complete and accurate. The
responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of Kemper’s financial statements and the assessment of the effectiveness of Kemper’s internal control
over financial reporting rests with Kemper’s management. It is the responsibility of Kemper’s independent registered public accountant to perform an
audit of, and to express an opinion on whether, Kemper’s annual financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of Kemper’s internal control over financial reporting. The responsibility of the Audit
Committee is to review and monitor these processes on behalf of the Kemper Board.

In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed Kemper’s audited financial statements and the effectiveness of Kemper’s internal
control over financial reporting with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP, Kemper’s independent registered public accountant for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017. The Audit Committee has also discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee has
received from, and discussed with, Deloitte & Touche LLP its written disclosures and letter regarding its independence required by applicable
requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accountant’s communications with the Audit Committee regarding
independence and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence.

In reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Kemper’s independent registered public accountant, the
Audit Committee recommended to the Kemper Board that Kemper’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 be included in
Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC.

KEMPER PROPOSAL 5: NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION
OF KEMPER’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Kemper stockholders will be asked to vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to
approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in accordance with applicable
compensation disclosure rules (the “Say-On-Pay Vote”).

At Kemper’s previous annual meeting of stockholders, Kemper’s stockholders approved the Say-On-Pay Vote by 97.7% of the votes cast on the
proposal, and voted in favor of having Kemper provide future Say-On-Pay Vote opportunities every year.

In voting on the non-binding advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers, Kemper stockholders will be
voting on whether to approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that, Kemper’s stockholders approve the compensation paid to Kemper’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item
402 of SEC Regulation S-K in the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the Kemper annual meeting, including the section captioned Kemper
Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related narrative discussions.”

This proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of the Kemper named
executive officers as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. The vote is
advisory, which means the vote is not binding on Kemper, the Kemper Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee
will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.

The section entitled “Kemper Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 81 provides detailed information on the executive
compensation program and amounts paid to Kemper’s named executive officers in fiscal year 2017. Kemper encourages all stockholders to review the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis disclosure in considering whether to vote in favor of this proposal. Kemper believes the 2017 executive
compensation program has served as an effective means of attracting and retaining the new members of its leadership team and that the program’s
components, including Kemper’s 2017 Annual Incentive Program (described on page 90 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus), will serve as a key
supporting mechanism to drive Kemper’s improved financial performance.

The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that Kemper stockholders vote to approve the compensation of Kemper’s named executive officers
as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus by voting “FOR” the Say-On-Pay Vote.

If a Kemper stockholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such stockholder’s proxy card, such
stockholder’s shares of Kemper common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Say-On-Pay Vote.

The approval by Kemper stockholders of the Say-On-Pay Vote is not a condition to the closing.

A Kemper stockholder’s election to abstain from voting, the failure of a Kemper stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through
a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record or any
other failure of a Kemper stockholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of this proposal.

DISCUSSION OF KEMPER COMPENSATION COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE

Kemper Compensation Committee Authority and Delegation

The scope and authority of the Compensation Committee is described in the section entitled “Kemper Corporate Governance—Meetings and
Committees of the Kemper Board.” The Compensation Committee has authority to retain outside advisors to assist the committee in its evaluation of
executive compensation, and to approve the fees and other terms of retention of such advisors. Under the terms of its charter, the Compensation
Committee may delegate authority, consistent with applicable law, to subcommittees. However, the Compensation Committee does not presently have
any subcommittees and no such delegations have been made.

The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to Kemper’s CEO to grant a limited number of awards under the Kemper Plan, designate
the recipients of such awards, and determine the size, terms and conditions of such awards. The delegated authority covers only new hire, promotional
and retention awards to employees other than Kemper’s officers who are required to file reports of their beneficial ownership of shares of Kemper
common stock under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The delegated authority is regularly monitored by the Compensation Committee.

Compensation Committee Process Overview

The Compensation Committee performs an annual review of Kemper’s executive compensation policies, practices and programs, and of the
compensation provided to Kemper’s executive officers and directors. Annual reviews have historically started at the Compensation Committee meeting
held in the last quarter of each year, with compensation determinations for Kemper’s executive officers approved at its first quarter meeting of the
following year. At or prior to its first quarter meeting, the Compensation Committee makes decisions on:
 

 •  annual compensation of Kemper’s executive officers;
 

 
•  determination of the amounts of any annual cash incentives payable for the prior year, including validation of performance results for

determining any payouts under performance-based cash and equity-based compensation awards granted for prior years;
 

 •  any changes to Kemper’s executive compensation plans and programs; and
 

 •  determinations as to the current-year cash and equity-based compensation.

Kemper’s CEO plays a key role in the decision-making process with regard to annual compensation for the other executive officers by providing
performance assessments and making compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee on salary, annual cash incentives, and equity-
based compensation awards. The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations and meets with the CEO to discuss his rationale. The
Compensation Committee works collaboratively with the CEO, taking into account his knowledge and judgment to determine the appropriate
compensation for those executive officers.

Also at its first quarter meeting each year, the Compensation Committee approves recommendations to the Board for any changes to the
non-employee director compensation program. Kemper’s executive officers are not involved in the process of analyzing and determining compensation
for the non-employee members of the Kemper Board, except the CEO, who participates as a Kemper Board member when non-employee director
compensation is considered and determined by the Kemper Board.

The Role of Compensation Consultants

The Compensation Committee has engaged the services of independent compensation consultants to assist with its executive and non-employee
director compensation review and oversight, and for such additional services as it has requested from time to time. The Compensation Committee
engaged Pay Governance LLC

(“Pay Governance”) as its independent compensation consultant for 2017. The Compensation Committee requested Pay Governance provide the
committee with benchmarking data based on comparable companies in the insurance industry, as well as general benchmarking data, for the executive
officers, data and practices with respect to non-employee director compensation, advice on current trends and developments related to executive
compensation, and advice on other executive and director compensation matters that arose in the ordinary course. The involvement of Pay Governance
in the 2017 executive compensation decision-making process is described in more detail in the section entitled “Kemper Compensation Discussion and
Analysis—Benchmarking Analysis” beginning on page 87.

Before retaining Pay Governance as its consultant, the Compensation Committee considered the firm’s independence and concluded that no
factors existed that presented any independence issues or conflicts of interest under applicable rules of the NYSE or SEC.

Executive Summary

Background

During 2017, Kemper’s financial turnaround efforts that started in late 2015 began to show significant results. The turnaround began in November
2015 with the hiring of Mr. Lacher as President and CEO, and continued in 2016 with the hiring of a number of senior executives to lead key business
units and major functional areas. The new senior leadership team was focused on improving operating results and providing the foundation for long-
term profitable growth and stockholder returns. The management team spent much of 2016 laying the groundwork and taking specific actions to
improve Kemper’s financial performance. In addition, Mr. Lacher and the senior leadership team worked to institute a new performance-driven culture
in Kemper to support the goal of improved financial performance and stockholder returns. The success of these efforts are reflected in Kemper’s
financial performance and stockholder returns in 2017 as discussed in more detail below.

Financial and Stockholder Performance

Each business unit contributed to the financial turnaround in 2017:
 

 ✓  Property & Casualty division generated solid financial performance outcomes.
 

 ✓  Life & Health continued its solid results.
 

 ✓  Continued strong performance in the investment portfolio.

The improved financial performance led to significant gains for stockholders as follows:
 

 ✓  The price of Kemper common stock improved from $44.30 on December 31, 2016 to $68.90 on December 31, 2017, representing an annual
gain of 55.5%.

Overall, Kemper’s 2017 financial performance demonstrates management’s progress on Kemper’s initiatives aimed at improving financial results,
and yielded significant stockholder returns. In addition, Kemper laid the groundwork in 2017 for the announcement by Kemper in February 2018 that it
had signed the Merger Agreement to acquire Infinity, a non-standard auto insurance provider. The proposed transaction, expected to close in the third
quarter of 2018, reflects Kemper’s strategy to focus on acquiring businesses within the overall insurance industry that strategically enhance its business.

Executive Compensation Outcomes

Key features of and decisions made in Kemper executive compensation program during 2017 include the following:
 

 
•  Kemper’s philosophy is to provide salary adjustments for executives every 3-5 years. Kemper provided no salary increases to its executive

officers in 2017.
 

 

•  Kemper’s annual performance-based cash incentive program (“Annual Incentive Program”) rewards participants for significant
improvement and the overall performance results of Kemper and its business units. Further, the program then allocates the highest
compensation to the highest performing and most impactful participants. Awards increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 in light of
Kemper’s improved financial performance.

 

 

•  Kemper’s performance-based equity awards include stock options and performance share units (“PSUs”), with three-year performance
metrics tied to relative total stockholder return (“Relative TSR”) and adjusted return on equity (“Three-Year Adjusted ROE”). Equity
awards are tied to key measures we believe are valued by stockholders including share price and relative stockholder return compared to
similarly situated insurance companies, and adjusted return on equity, a key indication of performance in the insurance industry. Kemper’s
executives realize gains with the increase in the price of Kemper common stock in line with such gains by stockholders.

Comparisons of annual and equity incentives from 2016 to 2017 are not representative for Messrs. McKinney, Brooks and Green because they
were with Kemper for only a portion of 2016.

Overall, Kemper believes the financial results and stockholder returns achieved in 2017 provided a solid basis for the annual and equity incentive
awards provided to Kemper’s management team. Kemper believes the results and awards effectively link pay and performance and align with
stockholder interests.

Kemper took note of the 97.7% stockholder vote to approve the “say-on-pay” proposal at Kemper’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. Kemper
did not make any changes to its compensation program as a result of the strong favorable expression of support.

Executive Compensation Program

Summary of Executive Compensation Elements

Kemper provides both fixed (salary) and performance-based (cash and equity incentives) compensation to NEOs. The majority of compensation
awarded to each NEO in 2017 was “at-risk” to the executive because it was contingent on Kemper’s performance and individual performance, and, for
the performance share component, the number of shares ultimately paid out can vary from the initial award. Additionally, the value of the option grants
awarded will increase commensurately with the price of Kemper common stock. The amount of “at risk” compensation based on performance is
designed to be significantly more than salary. The following charts show each element of 2017 target NEO compensation, including the mix of annual
cash and long-term equity incentives, as well as the overall percentages of fixed versus performance-based compensation for the CEO and for the other
NEOs (on average):
 

 
 
CEO Average of All Other NEOs Fixed Pay 15% Performance-Based Pay 85% Fixed Pay 27% Performance-Based Pay 73%

Table of Contents

What Kemper Does
 

✓  Pay-for-Performance: The majority of NEO total compensation is
tied to Kemper, business unit and individual performance and is
considered by Kemper to be “at risk,” with actual value being
contingent upon performance metrics.

 

✓  Independence of Executive Compensation Consultant (Pay
Governance): The Compensation Committee has engaged an
independent executive compensation advisor, as required by the SEC
and NYSE rules. Pay Governance has no personal relationships with
members of the Kemper Board or Kemper’s executive officers.

✓  Clawback Rights: Kemper’s cash incentive and equity programs
include clawback rights with regard to paid incentives in the event of
certain accounting restatements or as otherwise required by applicable
law.  

✓  Independent Committee Members: All Compensation Committee
members are considered independent in accordance with SEC and
NYSE guidelines.

✓  Dividend Equivalents Paid Only on Earned Awards: Beginning
with the 2018 equity grants, dividend equivalents will accrue on
performance shares during the performance period, but will be paid
once shares are earned.  

✓  Stock Ownership Guidelines: Kemper maintains rigorous stock
ownership guidelines for directors and executive officers to reinforce
the alignment of its executives with stockholder interests.

✓  Double-Trigger Change-in-Control: Kemper’s policy provides for
change of control benefits only if there is a qualified termination of
employment following the change of control.

 

✓  Strive to Understand Stockholders’ Views on Executive
Compensation: The 97.7% approval of Kemper’s Say-on-Pay
proposal at Kemper’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders
demonstrates that its program aligns with stockholder expectations.

 
What Kemper Does Not Do

 

✗   No Tax Gross-Ups: NEOs and other executive officers are not entitled
to tax gross-ups in the event of a change-in-control and related
termination.  

✗   No Hedging or Pledging: Directors and employees who receive
equity awards are prohibited from hedging, pledging or otherwise
encumbering shares of the Kemper common stock.

✗   No Employment Contracts: Kemper does not have employment
contracts with any of its NEOs or other executive officers, who are all
employees “at will.”

 

✗   No Excessive Perquisites: Perquisites primarily include annual
executive physical and basic financial planning programs. Executives
also participate in broad-based company-sponsored benefits programs
on the same basis as other full-time employees.

Compensation Strategy and Analysis

General Strategy

In its deliberations on executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers whether the cash and equity-based awards are consistent
with Kemper’s underlying principles and objectives, including long-term stockholder interests, the total value to individual executives and the cost to
Kemper. Executive compensation decisions reflect the following approach by the Compensation Committee:
 

 
•  Obtain a clear understanding of the business strategies and objectives of Kemper, and the reasoning and recommendations of senior

management. The Compensation Committee believes it is necessary to give significant weight to the views of the CEO and senior
management;

Table of Contents

 

•  Consider, with the assistance of its compensation consultant, industry data on compensation levels for similar positions at similar companies
in the insurance and general industry to assess the comparability of Kemper’s pay practices and determine if any noted variances are
reasonable, appropriate and purposefully designed to successfully attract, motivate and retain skilled executives in a highly competitive
marketplace;

 

 
•  Provide an annual cash incentive program structured to incentivize and reward exceptional financial, business unit and individual

performance during the prior year;
 

 
•  Reward longer-term results through equity-based incentives, including PSUs with three-year performance metrics based on Relative TSR

and Three-Year Adjusted ROE, and stock options that gain value based on absolute share price appreciation; and
 

 •  Monitor compliance by the Kemper senior management team with Kemper’s stock ownership policy.

The following table summarizes the material elements of Kemper’s 2017 executive compensation program. Further details regarding each of the
elements are provided in the discussion that follows the table.

Benchmarking Analysis

As part of its executive compensation review for 2017, the Compensation Committee considered a benchmarking analysis provided by Pay
Governance comparing the compensation components of salary, annual incentives, long-term incentives, and total compensation of Kemper’s CEO and
other executive officers relative to pay programs at a selected peer group (“Proxy Group”). Where possible, each Kemper management position was
compared to industry data using functional counterparts or executives with similar roles at the peer companies, as well as compensation data disclosed in
proxy statements filed in 2016.

The Proxy Group, approved by the Compensation Committee after considering recommendations of Pay Governance and input from management,
consisted of 15 publicly-traded companies in the insurance industry with profiles similar to Kemper’s based on information disclosed in their annual
reports and proxy statements. The Proxy Group companies generally had a majority of operations in the property and casualty insurance industry, and
variations in their revenues, assets and market capitalization versus Kemper were considered when the group was selected.

The following companies were included in the Proxy Group:
 
Alleghany Corporation   Horace Mann Educators Corporation
American National Insurance Company   Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation
Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.   Mercury General Corporation
W.R. Berkley Corporation   RLI Corp.
Cincinnati Financial Corporation   Selective Insurance Group, Inc.
FBL Financial Group, Inc.   Torchmark Corporation
First American Financial Corporation   White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd.
The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc.   

To provide a broader context, Pay Governance also compared Kemper’s executive compensation levels against additional market references,
including published survey data from similarly-sized companies in the broader insurance industry, and general industry data from Willis Tower Watson
executive pay surveys. The Compensation Committee did not consider the individual companies included in these additional market references for the
CEO, and does not believe their identification to be material with respect to the compensation of the other NEOs.

The Compensation Committee used the benchmarking data as a test of the reasonability of the compensation paid to Kemper’s executive officers.
In evaluating the benchmarking data, the Compensation Committee did not follow a rigid process, establish specific pay objectives in evaluating the
benchmarking data (such as, for example, targeting different elements of compensation at the median), or use the data as part of specific formulas when
making compensation determinations for these executives. Instead, the Compensation Committee considered the benchmarking analysis as a means of
identifying any outliers and determining whether the levels of compensation provided to the CEO and other executive officers were within appropriate
ranges relative to comparable companies.

Table of Contents

The benchmarking data was also subjectively considered by the Compensation Committee as an additional point of reference in its deliberations
on compensation levels for these executives, along with other factors such as total company and business unit performance, individual performance and
Kemper’s compensation philosophy and objectives. The Compensation Committee believes that Kemper’s executive compensation program is fair,
competitive with marketplace practices and effective in enhancing stockholder value.

Annual Determination of Specific Compensation

The objective of Kemper’s executive compensation program is to attract, retain and motivate the performance of Kemper’s executives by
providing competitive compensation structured to incentivize performance in support of Kemper’s strategy, and reward executives for achieving the
desired financial results and increased stockholder value.

The annual compensation program for the NEOs consists of a fixed salary component, an annual cash incentive award component that varies
based on performance, and an equity award based on multi-year financial metrics and long-term stock price appreciation. For the NEOs other than the
CEO, the equity award value is at a target percentage of salary. The equity award value may be increased or decreased on occasion at the discretion of
the Compensation Committee to recognize outsized performance, underperformance or other significant factors.

As salary is the only component that is fixed and not based on performance, it represents a relatively small portion of total compensation, and is
not adjusted annually. The Compensation Committee believes compensation based on performance, including awards under the Annual Incentive
Program, stock options and PSUs, provide the most effective means of driving successful and stockholder-focused performance. Time-based RSUs are
used in limited circumstances, specifically in grants to certain executives to induce them to join or remain with Kemper.

Salaries

The Compensation Committee did not make any changes to NEO salaries for 2017. The 2017 salaries for NEOs were as follows:
 

Name   Salary ($)  
Joseph P. Lacher, Jr    750,000 
James J. McKinney    450,000 
John M. Boschelli    400,000 
Charles T. Brooks    400,000 
Mark A. Green    420,000 

Performance-Based Cash Incentives and Equity Awards

Since each NEO holds a position that provides strategic direction, requires critical decision-making and drives Kemper’s performance and
financial results, the Compensation Committee:
 

 •  A material percentage of the NEO’s compensation should be linked to Kemper’s performance; and
 

 •  Greater responsibilities should lead to greater opportunities for incentive compensation.

Accordingly, cash incentives and equity-based awards linked to the outcome of Kemper’s financial metrics comprise a significant portion of each
NEO’s compensation. As previously noted, the Annual Incentive Program provides awards to the highest performing and most impactful participants.

Annual Cash Incentives for 2017

Executive Performance Plan

The Executive Performance Plan (“EPP”) was intended to serve as an “umbrella” plan and funding vehicle for annual cash incentives to ensure
full tax deductibility of performance-based cash incentives. Annual incentives under the EPP for 2017 were determined using a multi-step process:
 

 
•  A total incentive pool was determined under the formula approved by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the EPP, which is

stockholder-approved and designed to allow maximum tax deductibility of the incentive payouts; and
 

 

•  Maximum payouts to EPP participants were set based on allocations of the incentive pool determined by performance under a pre-approved
formula, with actual payouts to the NEOs determined in accordance with the Annual Incentive Program based on achievement against key
performance results as well as the discretionary judgment of the Compensation Committee for the NEOs and, for the other executive
officers, the CEO.

The material terms of the performance goals under the EPP were approved by Kemper stockholders at the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders.
The EPP was intended to serve as an “umbrella” plan and funding vehicle for annual cash incentives to ensure full tax deductibility of performance-
based cash incentives paid to certain officers under Section 162(m) (“162(m)”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). For
2017, these officers include a company’s chief executive officer and the other three executive officers, other than the chief financial officer, identified as
NEOs in a company’s 2018 proxy statement based upon their compensation for the 2017 performance period.

At its meeting in February 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the formula determining the funding of the annual cash incentive pool
(“EPP Incentive Pool”) based on pre-tax operating income from continuing operations for the performance period ending on December 31, 2017, and
the maximum percentage of the pool that may be allocated to individual participants under the plan. The formula approved for the 2017 EPP Incentive
Pool was set as follows:

Formula for 2017 EPP Incentive Pool

7% of Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes as reported in Kemper’s financial statements for 2017, modified as follows to
account for items the Compensation Committee deems not indicative of Kemper’s core operating performance:
 

 (a) adjust Actual Catastrophe Losses and LAE to equal Expected Catastrophe Losses and LAE (italicized terms defined below);
 

 
(b) adjust Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings (italicized terms as reported in

Kemper’s 2017 financial statements) to equal Expected Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Expected Net Impairment Losses
Recognized in Earnings (italicized terms defined below);

 

 (c) exclude significant unusual judgments or settlements in connection with Kemper’s legal contingencies or defined benefit pension plans; and
 

 (d) exclude additional significant unusual or nonrecurring items as permitted by the EPP.

The terms as used above are defined as follows:
 

 
•  “Actual Catastrophe Losses and LAE” means the actual Catastrophe Losses and associated Loss Adjustment Expenses (as described on

page 118), including catastrophe reserve development, as reported in Kemper’s management reports for the relevant year.

Table of Contents

 

•  Expected Catastrophe Losses, Expected Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments, and Expected Net Impairment Losses Recognized in
Earnings means the amounts specified in Kemper’s management reports as “Planned” or “Expected” for the 2017 annual performance
period for, respectively: (a) Catastrophe Losses and associated Loss Adjustment Expenses, including catastrophe reserve development,
(b) Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments, and (c) Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings, as such terms are defined in
Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Also at its meeting in February 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following allocations of any resulting 2017 EPP Incentive Pool
to determine the maximum annual cash incentive payable to the plan participants:
 

 •  40% to the Chief Executive Officer; and
 

 •  20% to each of the other NEOs subject to 162(m).

At its meeting in February 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the performance results under the 2017 EPP Incentive Pool formula and
determined the amount of the 2017 EPP Incentive Pool to be $17,571,000. The Compensation Committee determined the maximum incentive amounts
for the participating NEOs pursuant to the previously-approved 2017 EPP Incentive Pool allocations, subject to an overall limitation of $3,000,000 per
individual officer, which applied to each of the NEOs subject to the EPP given the dollar value of the 2017 EPP Incentive Pool. The Compensation
Committee exercised negative discretion in approving the award for Mr. Lacher. Likewise, Mr. Lacher exercised negative discretion in recommending
awards less than the maximum amounts to Messrs. Boschelli, Brooks and Green, which awards were approved by the Compensation Committee.

2017 Annual Incentive Program

The Annual Incentive Program is a cash incentive program adopted in 2016 to replace Kemper’s prior cash incentive program that had included
both annual and multi-year components. Each year an initial pool is established for participating employee groups. The initial pool for 2017 was an
amount estimated to be comparable to amounts paid out under the prior year plan. The initial pool was then increased at year end for overall business
performance, after consideration of financial performance, qualitative metrics and the achievement of strategic projects.

The adjusted pool was allocated to the participating groups and distributed in individual awards based on performance. Initial recommendations
were reviewed for calibration across function, organizational level, business groups and other relevant metrics, to significantly differentiate based on the
results delivered and individual performance.

In determining awards under the Annual Incentive Program for Kemper’s NEOs, the Compensation Committee considered quantitative financial
performance measures and qualitative criteria. The Compensation Committee did not use a formula or assign any relative weighting to any performance
measure. The Compensation Committee believes a strictly formulaic approach to individual incentive payments is not an appropriate substitute for the
Compensation Committee’s deliberation and business judgment. The level of achievement of any financial or operational measure does not guarantee
nor preclude the payment of an annual cash incentive, but is given significant weight by the Compensation Committee as a factor along with any
additional information available to it at the time, including general market conditions.

The Compensation Committee applied its judgment to the following qualitative factors in its overall assessment:
 

 
•  Progress on the strategic re-positioning of Kemper, including progress toward achieving Kemper’s objective of improved financial

performance;

Table of Contents

 •  Progress toward effecting the cultural change needed to sustain high performance levels going forward;
 

 •  Achievement of certain key strategic projects;
 

 
•  Receipt of a favorable ruling in a confidential arbitration proceeding against a software vendor that resulted in an award of direct damages of

over $84 million plus interest and legal costs and expenses;
 

 •  Effective management of risk and expenses; and
 

 
•  Overall performance of the NEOs, based on the judgment of the committee and the Chairman of the Kemper Board, and of the CEO in the

case of the other NEOs, including perceptions on leadership, teamwork, effective management and oversight.

The Compensation Committee also reviewed quantitative factors and management’s progress toward improved financial and operating
performance in 2017. The quantitative factors reviewed include net income, combined ratio, return on equity, written and earned premiums, and net
investment income, by business segment and operating unit within each business segment. The committee analyzed reported results against plan, prior-
year and industry results and considered underlying trends. In addition, the committee reviewed results with various adjustments for items it deemed not
indicative of Kemper’s core operating performance.

The Compensation Committee reviewed results with and without certain adjustments, including the following:
 

 •  reported results including Actual Catastrophe Losses and LAE, and Actual Catastrophe Losses and LAE adjusted to expected losses;
 

 •  reported results with and without unusual charges or gains;
 

 
•  reported results including realized gains and losses and impairments, and results adjusted to expected realized gains and losses and

impairments.

In determining award payouts for the individual NEOs under the Annual Incentive Program, the Compensation Committee reviewed key business
results and factors considered critical to the success of their respective business units and functional areas, in addition to the qualitative and quantitative
factors described above.

The Compensation Committee considered net income and return on equity, with and without certain adjustments, although these measures were
not individually determinative nor given any specific weight in comparison with other measures considered in determining adjustments to the initial
pool and specific incentive awards for the 2017 Annual Incentive Program. The following table shows 2017 and 2016 actual net income and return on
equity, each as reported and as adjusted:

2017 versus 2016 Performance Comparisons
 

Measure   2017 Actual    2016 Actual

The aggregate total of incentive payouts for the Annual Incentive Program under the EPP was $3,825,000, significantly less than the maximum
amounts allocated under the 2017 EPP Incentive Pool. As previously noted,

the EPP applied only to Kemper’s NEOs who were subject to 162(m) during 2017 and so did not apply to Mr. McKinney, Kemper’s Chief Financial
Officer. The following table shows the 2017 EPP Incentive Pool allocations and maximum amounts payable for 2017 annual awards under the EPP and

The Compensation Committee believes that these awards reflect fairly the actual financial performance outcomes achieved during 2017 and the
qualitative factors considered by the Compensation Committee as described above and, more specifically, the following issues deemed most pertinent to
the individual officer’s responsibilities:
 

 

•  Mr. Lacher, with the Kemper Board’s direction and advice, and with the assistance of a new leadership team which he formed, was
responsible for establishing a new pay-for-performance culture, executed against the turnaround strategy which realized improved financial
results and generated significant value for stockholders. In addition, Mr. Lacher drove the leadership of the Property & Casualty segment to
strengthen its management team and enhance the separation of its non-standard auto and preferred lines units.

 

 
•  Mr. Boschelli continued to run a solid investment group that again produced strong results, leveraged the structure of Kemper’s two

operating divisions, and achieved industry-leading returns.
 

 
•  Mr. Brooks led the centralization of all operations initiatives, which significantly improved Kemper’s efficiencies and systems

infrastructure.
 

 
•  Mr. Green continued to produce solid results in the Life and Health business; he led the development and implementation of operating

tactics capable of generating long-term profitable growth for the segment’s business units and strengthened their leadership capabilities,
positioning the business for continued improvement and growth in the future.

Mr. McKinney was awarded an annual incentive award of $750,000 for 2017 pursuant to Kemper’s Annual Incentive Program, with the amount
based on the Compensation Committee’s judgment, considering in particular that he furthered his efforts in the chief financial officer transition by
implementing an automation strategy and strengthening leadership capabilities in the Finance organization.

2015 Multi-Year Award Under 2009 Performance Incentive Plan

Mr. Boschelli is the only NEO who was employed by Kemper in February 2015, when the Compensation Committee approved the 2015 multi-
year incentive awards to Kemper’s executive officers for the three-year performance period that ended on December 31, 2017 (“Multi-Year PIP
Awards”). These awards were granted pursuant to the 2009 Performance Incentive Plan (“PIP”), under which annual and multi-year cash incentive
awards were granted until 2016, when Kemper adopted the Annual Incentive Program and ended multi-year award grants. Performance results and the
payout amount under Mr. Boschelli’s 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award were determined at the Compensation Committee’s meeting in February 2018, as
described below.

Performance Levels, Target Incentive Percentage and Performance Criteria

At its meeting in February 2015, the Compensation Committee granted a Multi-Year PIP Award to Mr. Boschelli, and assigned a target incentive
percentage of 55 percent, representing a percentage of his annual salary (“Target Incentive Percentage”) for his award. The Compensation Committee
established threshold, target and maximum performance levels. The threshold performance level is the minimum level of performance that must be met
before a payout may occur, and the maximum performance level was set at twice the target level. Salary for these awards was the average of
Mr. Boschelli’s salary in effect as of the first pay period in April 2015, 2016 and 2017.

In determining the payout for Mr. Boschelli, the actual results under the applicable performance criteria for the performance period were
compared to the applicable performance grids previously approved by the Compensation Committee to determine a target multiplier percentage (“Target
Multiplier”). The Target Multiplier was then applied to the Target Incentive Percentage and salary to determine the amount of any payout. For
performance above or below preapproved target levels, the Target Multiplier was interpolated on a straight-line basis. The weighted Target Multiplier for
the applicable performance criteria was determined from the applicable performance grids.

Performance Results and Payout

At its meeting in February 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the performance results for the Company Performance Criteria (as
described on page 117) applicable to Mr. Boschelli’s 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award. The Company Performance Criteria results are shown below, and
definitions of the relevant terms are provided in the section entitled “Supplement to Kemper’s Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on
page 116. The actual performance results were as follows, based on multiple criteria that resulted in a weighted Target Multiplier of 104.2 percent, as
shown in the following table:

Equity-Based Compensation Awards

Equity-based compensation continues to be an integral part of Kemper’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee
believes that Kemper’s equity-based compensation program incentivizes performance and stock ownership by its executive officers, thereby aligning the
interests of Kemper’s management and stockholders.

Award Methodology

The 2017 annual executive compensation program continued the prior year’s mix of equity-based, long-term incentive compensation awards
consisting of both PSUs and stock options. Mr. Lacher’s 2017 annual equity award was $2,500,000 and allocated 75 percent in stock options and
25 percent in PSUs. The Compensation Committee followed a target-value approach and allocation methodology approved in 2016 for annual equity
awards to the NEOs other than Mr. Lacher. The value of each other NEO’s annual equity compensation was based on a set percentage of the NEO’s
annual salary. The value was allocated 50 percent in stock options and 50 percent in PSUs, with the number of shares subject to each grant determined
with reference to the Kemper common stock price on the date of grant.

The value of the long-term incentive awards granted in February 2017 was set at 120 percent of salary for Messrs. Boschelli, Green and
McKinney, and 90 percent for Mr. Brooks.

PSU Awards Granted in 2017

Fifty percent of the PSU awards granted to the NEOs in February 2017 were based on Relative TSR and 50 percent were based on Three-year
Adjusted ROE. These awards are subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions until vesting on the date the Compensation Committee certifies the
performance results (“Vesting Date”) in accordance with the award agreements. The number of PSU shares granted to each NEO in February 2017
(“Target Shares”) that will vest and be issued as Kemper common stock, if any, and the number of additional shares of Kemper common stock, if any,
that will be granted on the Vesting Date (“Additional Shares”), will be determined based on the applicable performance results for the performance
period, as described in detail below.

Shares Based on Relative TSR

For the 50 percent of PSUs based on Relative TSR, the determination of vesting will be based on Kemper’s total stockholder return (“TSR”) over
a three-year performance period ending on January 31, 2020 relative to a peer group comprised of all companies in the S&P 1500 Supercomposite
Insurance Index (“Peer Group”). In accordance with the award agreements, TSR is calculated based on the average of the closing stock prices for 20
consecutive trading days prior to the beginning and end of the performance period, and assumes all dividends issued over the performance period are
reinvested. The award agreements provide for grants of Additional Shares to the award recipient if Kemper’s relative performance exceeds the “target”
performance level, which is the 50th percentile based on TSR relative to the Peer Group (“Relative TSR Percentile Rank”). The number of Target
Shares that will vest, if any, and the number of Additional Shares, if any, that will be granted, will be determined in accordance with the following table:

Shares Based on ROE

For the 50 percent of PSUs based on Three-Year Adjusted ROE, the determination of vesting will be based on Kemper’s adjusted return on equity
over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2019. The award agreements provide for grants of Additional Shares to the award
recipient if Kemper’s ROE exceeds the “target” performance level of 6.5 percent. The number of Target Shares that will vest, if any, and the number of
Additional Shares, if any, that will be granted, will be determined in accordance with the following table:
 

Three-Year Adjusted ROE (%)   
Total PSUs to Vest and/or Shares to be Granted

on Vesting Date as Percentage of Target Shares (%)
At least 7.8   200

6.5   100
5.2   50

Below 5.2   —  

The applicable terms are calculated as follows:

Three-Year Adjusted ROE is computed by dividing the sum of Adjusted Net Income for each of the three years in the performance period by the
sum of the Adjusted Average Shareholders’ Equity for each of the three years.

Adjusted Net Income is defined as Net Income as reported in Kemper’s financial statements for the respective year, adjusted to account for the
after-tax impacts of the following items, to the extent the Compensation Committee deems them not indicative of Kemper’s core operating performance:
 

 •  adjust the amount of Actual Catastrophe Losses and LAE to equal Expected Catastrophe Losses (italicized terms defined below);
 

 
•  adjust Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings (italicized terms as reported in

Kemper’s financial statements) to equal Expected Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Expected Net Impairment Losses
Recognized in Earnings (italicized terms defined below);

 

 •  significant unusual judgments or settlements in connection with Kemper’s legal contingencies or benefit plans; and
 

 •  additional significant unusual or nonrecurring items as permitted by the Kemper Plan.

Adjusted Average Shareholders’ Equity is defined as the simple average of Total Shareholders’ Equity (as reported in Kemper’s financial
statements) for the beginning and end of year for each year in the performance period, adjusted to account for the after-tax impacts of the following
items, to the extent the Compensation Committee deems them not indicative of Kemper’s core operating performance:
 

 
•  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Fixed Maturity Securities from Adjusted Shareholders Equity (italicized terms as reported in Kemper’s

financial statements as defined above and below);
 

 •  the modifications made in calculating Adjusted Net Income; and
 

 •  additional significant, unusual or nonrecurring items as permitted by the Kemper Plan.

Actual Catastrophe Losses and LAE means the actual Catastrophe Losses and associated Loss Adjustment Expenses, including catastrophe reserve
development, as reported in Kemper’s management reports for the relevant time period.

Expected Catastrophe Losses, Expected Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments, and Expected Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings
means the amounts specified in Kemper’s management reports as “Planned” or “Expected” for, respectively, (a) Catastrophe Losses and associated Loss
Adjustment Expenses, including catastrophe reserve development, (b) Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments, and (c) Net Impairment Losses
Recognized in Earnings.

Table of Contents

Unrealized Gains and Losses on Fixed Maturity Securities means the Unrealized Gains and Losses on Fixed Maturity Securities as reported in
Kemper’s management reports.

Additional Information

For performance falling between the percentile levels specified in the first column of each table above, the number of shares that will vest and be
issued as Kemper common stock or be forfeited, and the number of Additional Shares, if any, that will be granted on the Vesting Date will be
determined by straight-line interpolation from the percentages specified in the table. Any Target Shares that do not vest in accordance with the table
above will be forfeited on the Vesting Date. Under the terms of the applicable award agreements in effect for 2017 and prior years, outstanding Target
Shares of PSUs and outstanding RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents on the same basis as dividends are paid to holders of outstanding
shares of Kemper common stock. This payment of dividends on a current basis was changed for PSU and RSU grants made in 2018 and beyond;
dividends will be paid only on the total number of earned shares after vesting.

The February 7, 2017 grant date fair value of the performance-based RSUs was estimated at $45.27 per share for the portion based on Relative
TSR and $40.32 for the portion based on Three-Year Adjusted ROE. For a discussion of valuation assumptions, see Note 10, “Long-term Equity-based
Compensation,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Performance Results for 2015 PSU Awards

Mr. Boschelli is the only NEO who was employed by Kemper in February 2015 when the Compensation Committee granted PSU awards for the
2015 – 2017 Performance Period (“2015 PSU Awards”). In February 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the performance results of Kemper’s
Relative TSR for the 2015 PSU Awards. The TSR for Kemper and each company in the Peer Group was calculated using the 20-day average trading
price preceding the beginning and the end of the performance period. Kemper’s TSR was determined to be 110 percent for the performance
period. Relative to the Peer Group, Kemper ranked 4 out of the 50 companies, or at the 94th percentile. By comparison, peer companies at the 90th
percentile (maximum level), 50th percentile (target level) and 25th percentile (threshold level), ranked approximately 6, 25, and 38, respectively, out of
the 50 companies. Since Kemper’s performance was above the maximum level, the final number of shares earned equals 200 percent of the Target
Shares granted in 2015. As a result, on the vesting date, February 4, 2018, all Target Shares vested and the same number of Additional Shares were
granted. Mr. Boschelli received 6,000 shares of Kemper common stock upon the vesting of his 2015 PSU Award on February 4, 2018.

Other Features and Practices Related to the Equity Incentive Program

Equity-Based Compensation Granting Process

The Compensation Committee follows an established process for the review, approval and timing of grants of equity-based compensation for all
eligible employees of Kemper, including its executive officers. In making his annual grant recommendations to the Compensation Committee, the CEO
follows an established grant cycle, with the exception of off-cycle grants made in connection with key new hire, promotion or retention awards which
may be made with Compensation Committee approval or under the CEO’s delegated authority, as described in the next section. Kemper’s executive
officers play no role in the timing of option or other grants except with regard to such new hire, promotion or retention awards, the timing of which is
driven by the circumstances of the underlying event.

Kemper provides administration of its equity-based compensation plans. Following Compensation Committee approval, Kemper delivers award
agreements for acceptance by the recipients. All forms of equity-based compensation award agreements are approved by the Compensation Committee
in advance of their initial use.

Delegated Authority

As previously mentioned, the Compensation Committee has delegated authority to the CEO to grant a limited number of shares of Kemper
common stock under the Kemper Plan in connection with new hire, promotional and retention awards to employees other than Section 16 officers. The
exercise price of each stock option award granted under the delegated authority is the closing price of a share of Kemper common stock on the grant
date. The Compensation Committee is periodically informed about the awards granted pursuant to the delegated authority and periodically replenishes
the share pool used in this program from the pool of shares available in the stockholder-approved Kemper Plan.

Stock Ownership Policy

The Compensation Committee believes equity-based compensation awards to the executive officers, along with their subsequent retention of the
acquired shares of Kemper common stock, further align their interests with those of Kemper’s stockholders.

Kemper’s stock ownership policy provides minimum ownership requirements for its non-employee directors and executive officers based on a
multiple of their base compensation. The minimum ownership level for Kemper’s CEO is shares valued at five times his annual salary, while the
minimum level for the other NEOs is two times their annual salaries. In calculating ownership for purposes of the policy, RSU and DSUs are included,
but not performance-based awards.

The Compensation Committee monitors shareholdings by executive officers annually, as of year-end. As of December 31, 2017, the NEOs subject
to the policy either exceeded the minimum levels required under the policy or were within the five-year grace period to attain the minimum required
share ownership level due to their recent hire dates. The amount of Kemper common stock beneficially owned by each NEO as of the Kemper record
date is disclosed in the section entitled “Ownership of Kemper common stock” beginning on page 231.

Changes Made to NEO Compensation for 2018

At its meeting on February 6, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved 2018 compensation for the NEOs reflecting:
 

 •  No salary increases were granted for 2018.
 

 
•  The allocation of the equity award to Mr. Lacher was comprised of 50 percent stock options and 50 percent PSUs, a modification from 2017

and consistent with the allocations of the equity awards to the other NEOs.
 

 
•  The Compensation Committee, after consultation with the CEO and the Chairman of the Kemper Board, approved increases in equity award

target values (representing respective percentages of salary) from 120% to 150% for Messrs. McKinney, Boschelli and Green, and from 90%
to 120% for Mr. Brooks.

 

 
•  The Compensation Committee exercised its discretion to grant equity awards in excess of target values in recognition of Kemper’s

achievements in 2017, including its significantly improved financial and operational performance in advance of anticipated milestones,
strategic plan progress and exceptional stock performance.

 

 

•  Mr. Lacher’s 2018 award was determined by the Compensation Committee, with input from the Chairman of the Kemper Board, based on,
among other factors, his overall performance in 2017, performance on the 2017 objectives, as approved by the Kemper Board, total
compensation for comparable CEOs, in light of Kemper’s philosophy that Mr. Lacher’s total compensation should be heavily weighted
towards performance-based compensation.

 

 •  The equity award agreements approved for the 2018 grants incorporate the following changes:
 

 
•  maximum, target and threshold performance levels were increased from the 2017 awards for the PSUs based on Three-Year Adjusted

ROE;
 

 
•  stock option and RSU awards will vest in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, instead of

four installments beginning 6 months from the grant date and then on the three anniversaries of the first vesting date;
 

 
•  dividend equivalents on PSUs and RSUs will accrue until vesting instead of paying out on a quarterly basis and will only be paid on

total shares actually earned; and

 •  new restrictive covenants were added related to confidentiality, nonsolicitation and nondisparagement.

The following table illustrates the total compensation for each of the NEOs based on the components included in the Summary Compensation
Table in the section entitled “Executive Officer Compensation and Benefits—Summary Compensation Table” beginning on page 102 (the “Summary
Compensation Table”), but with the values in the “Stock Awards” and “Option Awards” columns based on awards granted in February 2018 instead of
February 2017. As noted above, the equity awards granted to the NEOs in February 2018 exceeded target values as a result of Kemper’s 2017
performance and were greater than equity awards granted in February 2017. As a result, Kemper believes the following table better represents the total
compensation of the NEOs based on 2017 performance than the total compensation amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table.

in accordance with Kemper’s policies, and incidental personal use of cell phones, computer equipment and other resources provided primarily for
business purposes.

Table of Contents

Employee Welfare Benefit and Retirement Plans

The NEOs are eligible for the following plans:
 

 
•  Employee welfare benefits under plans generally available to all full-time salaried employees and which do not discriminate in scope, terms

or operation in favor of executive officers;
 

 

•  Deferred Compensation Plan (as described on page 109), which allows the NEOs to elect to defer a portion of their salaries and cash
incentives. Information about the Deferred Compensation Plan in general, and more specific information about participation therein by the
NEOs, is provided in the section entitled “Executive Officer Compensation and Benefits—Deferred Compensation Plan” beginning on page
109;

 

 

•  The 401(k) and Retirement Plan applicable to all full-time salaried employees, including executive officers, meeting age and service-based
eligibility requirements. Due to his hire date prior to 2006, Mr. Boschelli had been eligible for benefit accruals under Kemper’s Pension Plan
in lieu of the retirement contribution under the 401(k) and Retirement Plan until June 30, 2016 when Pension Plan benefit accruals were
frozen for all participants.

 

 

•  Nonqualified supplemental defined contribution retirement plan (“Retirement SERP”), available to key employees designated annually by
the Kemper Board to provide benefits using the same formulas used for the tax-qualified retirement plan but without regard to the limits
imposed under the Code. Mr. Boschelli had been eligible for a benefit accrual under Kemper’s nonqualified supplemental defined benefit
pension plan (“Pension SERP”) in lieu of the Retirement SERP until June 30, 2016 when Pension SERP benefit accruals ceased as a result
of the freezing of the Pension Plan accruals; and

 

 
•  Voluntary participation in the 401(k) portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan includes a matching contribution feature by Kemper offered

to all full-time salaried employees, including executive officers, meeting age and service-based eligibility requirements.

Additional information about Kemper’s retirement plans and participation therein by the NEOs is provided in the section entitled “Executive
Officer Compensation and Benefits—Retirement Plans” beginning on page 111.

Other Post-Employment Compensation

Change in control benefits applicable to the NEOs are described in more detail under the section entitled “Kemper Compensation Discussion and
Analysis—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” beginning on page 110. These benefits are provided under individual severance
agreements with the NEOs and provisions included in agreements with all grant recipients in applicable equity award agreements under the Kemper
Plan and the PIP under these plans. The NEOs are not entitled to other post-termination benefits except pursuant to the standard provisions of any of the
plans discussed above.

Tax Implications

Section 162(m) imposes an annual limit of $1 million per person on the corporate tax deduction for compensation paid by a company to its chief
executive officer and the other officers listed in its proxy compensation tables due to their compensation. Until 2018, the limit did not apply to a
company’s chief financial officer, or to certain performance-based compensation that met specific exemption requirements. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act signed into law in December 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”), the $1 million limit on deductibility will also apply to chief financial officers, and the
exemption for performance-based compensation has been eliminated, subject to applicable transition rules.

Prior to the Tax Reform Act, Kemper had generally intended most components of executive compensation to qualify as tax deductible for federal
income tax purposes, to the extent practicable in particular hiring and

compensation decisions, and consistent with the objectives and underlying philosophy of its executive compensation program. The EPP, as well as the
Kemper Plan and its predecessor equity plans, were designed to enable Kemper to grant awards qualified as performance-based compensation under
Section 162(m). As was required by Section 162(m), Kemper obtained stockholder approval of the EPP in 2014 and of the Kemper Plan in 2016. Due to
the Tax Reform Act, Kemper no longer expects most incentive compensation awarded after 2017 to be tax deductible due to the elimination of the
exception for performance-based compensation.

(1) Amounts for each officer are shown only for years in which he served as an NEO.
(2) These amounts represent salary earned for each of the years an individual was an NEO. Pursuant to Kemper’s regular compensation cycle, salary adjustments for

any year generally take effect in April of such year. As a result, for any year in which an individual officer’s salary was increased or decreased, a portion of the
amount of salary shown for such year was earned at the rate in effect prior to the adjustment.

(3) These amounts represent signing bonuses granted to Messrs. McKinney and Green in 2016.
(4) These amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair values of the equity awards (stock options, PSUs and RSUs) to the designated NEOs pursuant to the Kemper

Plan. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of each option (including its tandem stock appreciation rights) on the grant date. A
Monte Carlo simulation method was used to estimate the fair values on the grant date of the awards of the PSUs based on Relative TSR. PSUs based on ROE and
RSUs were valued using the closing price of a share of Kemper common stock on the grant date. For a discussion of valuation assumptions, see Note 10, “Long-
term Equity-based Compensation,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017. These equity awards are subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions until they vest in accordance with their respective grant agreements.

If achievement of the performance conditions at the maximum performance level is assumed, the aggregate number and market value of the

(5) These amounts were earned under Kemper’s annual cash incentive programs. With regard to the payments shown for Mr. Boschelli, for 2017, they were made under

the Annual Incentive Program and his 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award (and paid in 2018), for 2016, they were made under the Annual Incentive Program and his 2014
Multi-Year PIP Award (and paid in 2017), and for 2015, they were made under his 2015 Annual PIP Award and 2013 Multi-Year PIP Award (and paid in 2016). The
amounts shown for the other NEOs other than Mr. McKinney were made for 2017 and 2016 (and paid in 2018 and 2017, respectively), under the Annual Incentive
Program and the EPP. The amount shown for Mr. McKinney was made for 2017 (and paid in 2018) under the Annual Incentive Program.

(6) These amounts represent the change in actuarial present value for Mr. Boschelli under Kemper’s Pension Plan and Pension SERP as of December 31 of 2017, 2016
and 2015 from the end of the prior calendar year. No amounts are shown for the other NEOs because they were not eligible to participate in these plans due to their
hire dates; they instead became participants in the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan and Retirement SERP after meeting initial eligibility
requirements. Mr. Boschelli became eligible to participate in the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan and Retirement SERP after the Pension Plan
and Pension SERP were frozen as of June 30, 2016. For more information, see the section entitled “Executive Officer Compensation and Benefits—Retirement
Plans” beginning on page 102. The year-to-year changes in pension values is generally attributable to an increase in the present value of future payments due to a
decrease in the applicable discount rate in 2017.

(7) The amounts shown for 2017 for each NEO include perquisites and additional compensation of the types indicated in the following table:

Grant of Plan-Based Awards

PSU Awards

The PSUs awarded to the NEOs in February 2017 are subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions until the third anniversary of the grant date in
accordance with the award agreements. Determination of the number of shares of Kemper common stock that will vest or be forfeited, and of any
Additional Shares that will be granted, will be based, for half of the PSUs, on Kemper’s Relative TSR relative to the Peer Group, and for the other half
of the PSUs, on Kemper’s Three-Year Adjusted ROE, each based on a three-year performance period as described in more detail in the section entitled
“Annual Determination of Specific Compensation—PSU Awards Granted in 2017” beginning on page 94.

Stock Options

The stock options awarded to the NEOs in February 2017 are non-qualified options for federal income tax purposes, have an exercise price equal
to the closing price of a share of Kemper common stock on the grant date and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The stock options were
coupled with SARs and become exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning on the six-month anniversary of the grant date. References to
stock options in this proxy statement generally include tandem SARs.

Incentive Plan Awards

Annual incentive compensation award payouts for 2017 were approved and made under Kemper’s EPP and Annual Incentive Program in February
2018. The maximum potential amount for awards under the EPP shown in the table below is the maximum provided under the EPP for an annual award
to any participant. No maximum amount is shown for Mr. McKinney because, as Kemper’s Chief Financial Officer, he was not covered by the EPP due
to the pre-Tax Reform Act exclusion of chief financial officers from the deductibility limitations under Section 162(m). The performance criteria and
process of determining payouts under these awards are described in more detail in the section entitled “Kemper Compensation Discussion and Analysis
—Annual Cash Incentives for 2017” beginning on page 88.

Table of Contents

(1) No threshold or target amounts are provided under the EPP or the Annual Incentive Program. The amounts shown represent the annual maximum incentive to any participant under the
terms of the EPP because the amounts determined by the Compensation Committee at its meeting on February 6, 2018 based on the previously-approved formula and allocation
percentages exceeded the maximum. The maximum amounts payable to each participant could not have been determined at the beginning of the performance period. The process for
determining the awards for the NEOs and the amounts of the awards that were approved by the Compensation Committee for 2017 are detailed in the narrative descriptions about the
EPP and the Annual Incentive Program in the section entitled “Kemper Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Annual Cash Incentives for 2017” beginning on page 89, and the table
captioned “Annual Incentive Payouts – 2017 Annual EPP Awards” on page 92. No maximum amount is shown for Mr. McKinney because, as Kemper’s Chief Financial Officer, he was
not subject to the award maximum under the EPP due to the pre-Tax Reform Act exclusion of chief financial officers from the deductibility limitations under 162(m).

(2) These columns show a range of payouts possible under the PSU awards granted in 2017 under the Kemper Plan. The amount shown in the “Target” column for each award represents
100 percent of the PSUs granted, which equals the number of units that would vest if the “Target” performance level is achieved. The “Threshold” level is the minimum level of
performance that must be met before any payout may occur, and the amount shown in the “Threshold” column is 50 percent of the “Target” payout amount. The amount shown in the
“Maximum” column is 200 percent of the “Target” payout amount. Further information about these awards see the section entitled “Executive Officer Compensation and Benefits—PSU
Awards Granted in 2017”.

(3) These are non-qualified stock options granted under the Kemper Plan.
(4) The exercise price of the stock option awards is equal to the closing price of a share of Kemper common stock on the grant date.
(5) The amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair values of the 2017 stock option and PSU awards. For stock options, the grant date fair values were estimated based on the

Black-Scholes option pricing model. For PSUs based on Relative TSR, the grant date fair values were estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For PSUs based on ROE and
time-based RSUs, the grant date fair values were based on the closing price of a share of Kemper common stock on the grant date. For a discussion of valuation assumptions, see Note
10, “Long-term Equity-based Compensation,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Retirement Plans

Kemper sponsors two tax-qualified retirement plans, the Pension Plan and the 401(k) and Retirement Plan. In addition to other requirements,
eligibility for the Pension Plan had required a hire date prior to January 1, 2006. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are eligible to participate
in the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan. Effective June 30, 2016, the Pension Plan was frozen and its participants became eligible for
the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan. In general, eligibility under the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan requires
employees to be at least 21 years old with at least one year of service with Kemper (as defined in the plan). The NEOs are participants in the retirement
portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan. Based on his hire date, Mr. Boschelli had been a participant in the Pension Plan through June 30, 2016 when
his benefits were frozen and he became eligible for the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan. The NEOs are also eligible to defer on a
voluntary basis a portion of their salaries under the 401(k) portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan that includes a matching contribution feature by
Kemper offered to all employees meeting the age and service-based eligibility requirements.

Under the Pension Plan, a participant earned a benefit in an amount equal to a specified percentage of “Average Monthly Compensation” plus an
additional specified percentage of “Average Monthly Compensation” above the monthly “Social Security Covered Compensation,” multiplied by the
participant’s eligible years of service, up to a maximum of 30 years. “Average Monthly Compensation” is generally equal to the average of a
participant’s highest monthly compensation over a 60-consecutive-month period during the 120-month period that ends three calendar months prior to a
participant’s termination date, or for 2016, the date that the Pension Plan was frozen. The “Social Security Covered Compensation” amount is
determined from tables published by the Internal Revenue Service and changes each year. Mr. Boschelli is vested in the Pension Plan, as participants
were vested after completing five years of service with Kemper.

Under the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, Kemper makes an annual contribution, generally in February of the following
year, on behalf of a participant in an amount equal to the participant’s “Annual Compensation” multiplied by a specified contribution percentage based
on the participant’s years of vesting service with Kemper (as such terms are defined in the plan). Mr. Boschelli is vested under the retirement portion of
the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, as participants are vested after completing three years of service with Kemper.

Compensation covered by both the Pension Plan and the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan includes the participant’s salary and
annual bonus. Age 65 is the normal retirement age under the qualified retirement plans. The normal form of distribution under the Pension Plan is a life
annuity for a single retiree, or a joint and fifty-percent survivor annuity for a married retiree. Other forms of annuity are available to participants, but all
forms of payment are actuarially equivalent in value. The normal form of distribution under the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan is a
lump-sum payout.

The Pension SERP and Retirement SERP were established to provide benefits to certain individuals in excess of the limitations imposed on the
Pension Plan and the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement Plan, respectively, under the Code. The Pension SERP was effectively frozen as of
June 30, 2016 when the Pension Plan was frozen. The Retirement SERP benefit is, and the Pension SERP benefit previously was, computed using the
same formula used for the respective tax-qualified retirement plan, without regard to the limits imposed under the Code. An employee who earns
compensation over the qualified plan limitation may be eligible to participate in the Retirement SERP, or previously the Pension SERP, by designation
of the Kemper Board. For 2017, compensation to determine the benefit under the Pension Plan and the retirement portion of the 401(k) and Retirement
Plan was limited to $270,000.

As noted above, only Mr. Boschelli was eligible to participate in the Pension Plan and Pension SERP due to his date of hire. The following table

(1) A participant’s initial year of service as an employee is not used to determine credited service under the Pension Plan and Pension SERP. In
addition, benefits for all participants under the Pension Plan were frozen as of June 30, 2016. The number of years of credited service shown for
Mr. Boschelli are less than his actual years of service by eight years and six months due to the Pension Plan freeze date and a lump-sum payout of
six-years of accrued benefits he received because of a break in his service with Kemper in 1997.

(2) These accumulated benefit values are based on the years of credited service shown and the Average Monthly Compensation (as defined in the
Pension Plan) as of June 30, 2016, as described above in the narrative preceding this table. These present value amounts were determined on the
assumption that distribution of benefits under the plans will not begin until age 65, the age at which retirement may occur under the Pension Plan
and Pension SERP without any reduction in benefits, using the same measurement date, discount rate and actuarial assumptions described in Note
16, “Pension Benefits,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The discount rate assumption was derived from the AON Hewitt AA Bond Universe Curve as of 12/31/2017 with a single
equivalent rate of 3.55 percent and the mortality assumptions were based on the RP-2006 Table for Employees and Healthy Annuitants, Projected
Generationally with Scale MP-2017.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

Deferred Compensation Plan

The Deferred Compensation Plan was established to allow certain executives who are designated by the Kemper Board, as well as the
non-employee members of the Kemper Board, to elect to defer a portion of their current-year compensation to a future period. The NEOs are eligible to
participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan, but none elected to defer any of their 2017 compensation. The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded
and exempt from certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Kemper does not fund or make profit-
sharing or matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan, and participants have an unsecured contractual commitment by Kemper to
pay the amounts deferred, adjusted to recognize earnings or losses determined in accordance with their elections under the plan.

To participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan, an eligible individual must make an annual irrevocable election. The form and timing of the
distribution of deferrals made during any given year is chosen when a participant elects to participate for that year and generally cannot be altered or
revoked. The distribution for a particular year may be in the form of annual or quarterly installments payable up to a maximum of ten years or a

single lump-sum payment. All payments begin on January 1 of the year chosen by the participant when the election is made. A participant may elect to
defer up to 60 percent of his or her regular annual salary and up to 85 percent of each award earned under any incentive plan award or annual
discretionary bonus regardless of amount. Withdrawals are not permitted under the Deferred Compensation Plan other than regularly scheduled
distributions or upon Death or Disability if so chosen by the participant at the time of the annual election.

Each participant’s bookkeeping account is deemed to be invested in the hypothetical investment choice(s) selected by the participant from the
choices made available by Kemper. Investment choices may be changed by participants on a daily basis. Generally, the hypothetical investment
alternatives offered by Kemper include a range of retail mutual funds selected by the plan administrator, which is the Compensation Committee of the
Kemper Board. Investment choices selected by a participant are used only to determine the value of the participant’s account. Kemper is not required to
follow these investment selections in making actual investments of amounts deferred under the plan.

Retirement SERP

The Retirement SERP is discussed in the section entitled “Executive Officer Compensation and Benefits—Retirement Plans” beginning on page
108. Contribution credits for 2017 were made in February 2018 to the Retirement SERP accounts for the NEOs other than Mr. McKinney. The amounts
of these contributions are shown in the table below. Mr. McKinney became a participant in January 2018 and will be eligible for an initial contribution
for 2018 in February 2019.

The following table shows the aggregate earnings in 2017 and the balances as of December 31, 2017 for the NEOs under the Deferred
Compensation Plan and Retirement SERP.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control

The following narrative describes the applicable terms of the agreements or plans that would provide benefits to the NEOs if their employment
had terminated on December 31, 2017. The table below shows benefits that would have been payable to the NEOs as a direct result of either a change in
control of Kemper or the death or disability of the individual officer, had such an event occurred on December 31, 2017. The amounts shown in the table
would have been payable pursuant to individual severance agreements (“Severance Agreements”) between the NEOs and Kemper in the context of a
“change in control” of Kemper, as described below, or individual grant agreements executed with Kemper in connection with cash incentive, stock
option, PSU and/or RSU awards they received. None of the NEOs is a party to any other agreement with Kemper that would have entitled him to receive
any severance payments or other termination benefits from Kemper as of December 31, 2017.

Table of Contents

Retirement Plans

In addition to the amounts shown in the table entitled “Potential Payments Upon Termination From A Change In Control Or Death/Disability At
December 31, 2017” beginning on page 113, the NEOs would have been entitled to receive benefits to which they have vested rights upon retirement
under the Pension Plan and Pension SERP (or 401(k) and Retirement Plan and Retirement SERP), as described and/or quantified in the section entitled
“Executive Officer Compensation and Benefits—Retirement Plans” beginning on page 108 and in the “Pension Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation” tables and corresponding footnotes, beginning on pages 109 and 110, respectively. Any NEOs who had participated in the Deferred
Compensation Plan might have been entitled to receive distributions in accordance with their previously chosen elections under the plan, as described
above under the caption Nonqualified Deferred Compensation. In addition, the NEOs would have been entitled to receive benefits that are generally
available to employees of Kemper and do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of executive officers. These include benefits payable:
(a) upon termination of employment, such as payments of 401(k) and Retirement Plan distributions and accrued paid time off; and (b) upon death or
disability, under life, business travel or long-term disability insurance.

None of the NEOs had reached early retirement age as of December 31, 2017 and so none would have been eligible to begin receiving retirement
benefits as of December 31, 2017.

Severance Agreements

The Severance Agreements would provide various severance benefits to the NEOs in the event their employment terminates under certain
circumstances within two years after a “change in control.” Such benefits are also payable to such officers in the event their employment is involuntarily
terminated (other than for cause, disability or death) or voluntarily terminated with “good reason,” in either case in anticipation of a change in control.
Under the Severance Agreements, a “change in control” is deemed to occur if any person (excluding certain defined persons) is or becomes, directly or
indirectly, the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of the voting power of Kemper common stock, or the individuals who comprised the Kemper
Board on the date of the Severance Agreement, or any of the individuals they nominate, cease to comprise a majority of the Kemper Board, or if, under
the circumstances specified in the Severance Agreements, a merger or consolidation of Kemper or sale of substantially all of Kemper’s assets is
consummated or a liquidation or dissolution plan is approved by Kemper’s stockholders.

If applicable, each NEO would be entitled under the Severance Agreements to receive the following, subject to execution of a release and other
specified requirements:
 

 

•  a lump-sum severance payment based on a multiple of three (for Mr. Lacher) or two (for the other NEOs) of such officer’s annualized salary
and annual incentive, determined as of the higher of such officer’s prior-year annual incentive or a percentage of such officer’s salary
(150 percent for Mr. Lacher or 110 percent for the other NEOs) (“Annual Incentive”) plus a pro-rata portion of the Annual Incentive based
on the number of months such officer was employed during the year in which the change in control occurred;

 

 
•  continuation for three years (for Mr. Lacher) or two years (for the other NEOs) of the life insurance benefits being provided by Kemper to

such NEO and his dependents immediately prior to termination;
 

 
•  a lump-sum payment equal to the excess of cost for COBRA coverage over the employee-cost for health insurance benefits for thirty-six

months (for Mr. Lacher) or twenty-four months (for the other NEOs) being provided by Kemper to such NEO and his family immediately
prior to termination, regardless of whether COBRA coverage is elected by the NEO; and

 

 •  outplacement services at Kemper’s expense for up to fifty-two weeks.

Table of Contents

The Severance Agreements include a provision related to potential excise taxes payable by the NEOs under Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code
that would entitle them to receive either (a) the full benefits payable as a result of a qualifying termination related to a change of control, whether under
the Severance Agreements, equity award agreements or other applicable provisions (subject to such potential excise taxes), or (b) a reduced amount that
falls below the applicable safe harbor provided under Section 280G, whichever amount provides the greater after-tax value to the NEO.

Performance Incentive Plan Awards

Mr. Boschelli had one outstanding Multi-Year PIP Award as of December 31, 2017. If his employment had terminated as of December 31, 2017
due to a “change in control” of Kemper (as defined under the applicable award agreements), the applicable performance period for any outstanding
Multi-Year PIP Award would have ended on such date. The amount of the payout due under such award would have been the greater of the payout due:
(a) based on the actual results for the revised performance period relative to the applicable performance goal(s) for the award; or (b) at the target
performance level for the award.

If Mr. Boschelli’s employment had terminated as of December 31, 2017 due to death or disability, the applicable performance period for the
outstanding Multi-Year PIP Award would have ended on such date. The amount of the payout due under such award would have been the amount due at
the target performance level for such award, reduced pro-rata based on the number of months remaining in the performance period as of the date of
termination. If Mr. Boschelli’s employment had terminated as of December 31, 2017 for any other reason, such outstanding Multi-Year PIP Award
would have been forfeited on the termination date.

Equity-Based Awards

Stock Option Awards

If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017 due to death or disability or due to a change in control of Kemper, any
outstanding unvested stock option award would have vested on the termination date. For awards granted beginning in 2014, if the employment of an
NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017 and, as of such date, such officer was Retirement Eligible, any outstanding unvested stock option award
would remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting terms. If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of
December 31, 2017 for any other reason, such outstanding unvested stock option awards would have been forfeited on the termination date.

RSU Awards

If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017 due to death or disability or due to a change in control of Kemper, any
outstanding unvested RSU awards would have vested on the termination date. For awards granted beginning in 2014, if the employment of an NEO had
terminated as of December 31, 2017 and, as of such date, such officer was Retirement Eligible, any outstanding unvested RSU awards would remain
outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting terms. If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017
for any other reason, such outstanding unvested RSU awards would have been forfeited on the termination date.

PSU Awards

If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017 due to a change in control of Kemper, the performance period for any
outstanding performance-based RSU awards held by such officer would have ended on the termination date. The shares granted under each award would
have vested in an amount equal to the number of shares that would vest based on the greater of the target performance level or actual performance
results for the truncated performance period.

Table of Contents

If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017 due to death or disability, the performance period for any outstanding PSU
awards held by such officer would have ended on the termination date. The shares granted under each award would have vested in an amount equal to
the number of shares that would vest at the target performance level, reduced pro-rata based on the ratio of the number of months in the truncated
performance period to the total number months in the original performance period.

If the employment of an NEO had terminated as of December 31, 2017 and, as of such date, such officer was Retirement Eligible, any outstanding
PSU awards would remain outstanding until the end of the original performance period and then vest or be forfeited as determined based on actual
performance results, but reduced pro-rata based on the ratio of the number of months that such officer was employed during the performance period to
the total number months in the performance period. If, as of such termination date, such officer was not Retirement Eligible, any outstanding unvested
PSU awards would have been forfeited on the termination date.

The following table shows amounts that would have become payable to the NEOs in connection with their termination of employment as of
December 31, 2017 resulting from a change in control of Kemper or the death or disability of the individual officer.

(1) The amounts shown represent cash severance payable under the Severance Agreements assuming no reduction would be made under the provision in the agreements
related to potential excise taxes payable by the NEOs under Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code. Any such reduction would have been determined based on the
specific facts of the actual termination event.

(2) The amounts shown for a hypothetical termination due to a change in control assume the acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stock options, PSUs and RSUs as
of December 31, 2017. Acceleration of the vesting would occur automatically upon the death or disability of the NEO pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans
and grant agreements. The amounts shown represent the “in-the-money” value of the stock options and market value of PSUs and RSUs that would have been
subject to accelerated vesting as of December 31, 2017. The total numbers and market values of unvested PSUs and RSUs and the numbers of shares subject to
outstanding stock options, and the exercise prices thereof, are set forth in the “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2017 Fiscal Year-End” table on page 106. The
accelerated values shown were calculated using the closing price of $68.90 per share of Kemper common stock on December 29, 2017.

(3) The amounts shown represent the values of outstanding RSUs that would automatically vest from the hypothetical termination event.
(4) The amounts shown for a hypothetical termination due to a change in control represent estimated values of payouts under the 2015, 2016 and 2017 PSUs resulting

from such event as of December 31, 2017. In such event, the payout under outstanding PSUs would be based on the greater of performance at the target level or
actual performance results for a truncated performance period ending on the date of the change in control. Except for the 2016 PSUs based on Relative TSR, the
values included in the table represent a payout at the target performance level because the actual performance for the truncated period were below the target
performance level. For the 2016 PSUs based on Relative TSR, the values included in the table represent a payout at the maximum performance level because the
actual performance for the truncated period exceeded the performance level necessary to obtain a maximum payout.

(5) The amounts shown for a hypothetical death or disability represent estimated values of payouts under the 2015, 2016 and 2017 PSU awards resulting from such
event as of December 31, 2017. In such event, the amount of the payout for each award would have been determined at the target level but reduced pro-rata based
on the number of months in the Performance Period (as described on page 117 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) during which the NEO was an active
employee for at least fifteen days divided by the total number of months in the original Performance Period.

(6) The amounts shown for a hypothetical termination due to a change in control represent estimated values of payout to Mr. Boschelli under his 2015 Multi-Year PIP
Award resulting from such event as of December 31, 2017. In such event, the amount of the payout for the award would have been the greater of the payout due
based on the actual performance results or at the target performance level. The amount included in the table represents the amount of the payout for at the actual
performance level because the actual performance results were higher than target. The processes for determining Mr. Boschelli’s 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award payout
under possible termination events are described in the narrative preceding this table.

(7) The amount shown for a hypothetical death or disability represent estimated values of payouts under Mr. Boschelli’s 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award resulting from
such event as of December 31, 2017. In such event, the amount of the payout for the award would have been determined at the target level but reduced pro-rata
based on the number of full months in the Performance Period during which he was an active employee divided by the total number of months in the original
Performance Period. For the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2017, the value included in the table represents 100 percent of a payout at the
target performance level. The processes for determining Mr. Boschelli’s 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award payout under possible termination events are described in the
narrative preceding this table.

(8) The amounts shown are the estimated costs to Kemper to provide continuation of life insurance benefits for up to three years (in the case of Mr. Lacher) or two years
(for the other NEOs), lump-sum payments related to health insurance, and outplacement services for fifty-two weeks pursuant to the Severance Agreements, as
described in the narrative preceding this table. The lump-sum payment related to health insurance is equal to the amount that the COBRA-rate would exceed the
active-employee rate for the officer’s coverage for 36 months for Mr. Lacher and 24 months for all other NEOs regardless of whether such officer would elect to
continue coverage under COBRA.

Pay Ratio Disclosure

Kemper determined our median employee from our entire employee population to provide a ratio comparison of the total compensation of
Mr. Lacher, Kemper’s CEO, with the total compensation of the median employee for 2017. In doing so, Kemper annualized the compensation of all full-
time and part-time employees. The median employee’s compensation was determined as of October 1, 2017, in accordance with the methodology and
components used in the Summary Compensation Table for Kemper’s NEOs. The 2017 total compensation was determined to be $63,826 for Kemper’s
median employee, and $4,940,145 for Mr. Lacher. Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Lacher to that of the
median employee is estimated to be 77 to 1. The applicable SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow
companies to use different methodologies and assumptions, and as a result, our estimated pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratios disclosed by
other companies.

SUPPLEMENT TO KEMPER’S COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The following information supplements the disclosures in the section entitled “Kemper Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on
page 81.

Kemper reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, Kemper management believes evaluating Kemper’s ongoing operating
results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Kemper management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to
assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating Kemper’s financial performance over
time. Kemper also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the
comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of
Kemper’s revenue and expenses. Kemper management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from,
or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies.

The following table supplements the information in the table captioned “2017 Versus 2016 Performance Comparisons” in the section entitled

Table of Contents

The following supplements the information included in the section about the 2015 Multi-Year Awards under 2009 Performance Incentive Plan
under the subheading Performance Results and Payouts, beginning on page 93:

Definitions of Company Performance Criteria under 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award for Mr. Boschelli:

The Target Multiplier applicable to the 2015 Multi-Year PIP Award to Mr. Boschelli was determined by computing a weighted average of the
Target Multipliers derived for the following four performance criteria (the “Company Performance Criteria”) for the three-year performance period
ending December 31, 2017 (“Performance Period”). The Company Performance Criteria are referenced in the table entitled “Determination of
Weighted Target Multiplier” on page 93 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Performance Criterion 1
 

 
•  3-Year Excess Return from Corporate Investments (v. Weighted Average Peer Return) (weighted 20%). This is determined by

comparing the 3-year Kemper Total Investment Return to the results of a “Weighted Average Peer Return” for the Performance Period.
Excess Return is expressed in basis points. A simple average was calculated of the return for each year in the Performance Period.

Performance Criterion 2
 

 
•  3-Year Excess Return from Pension Investments (v. Benchmark) (weighted 5%). This was determined by comparing the 3-year Kemper

Total Pension Return for Kemper’s Pension Portfolio to the 3-Year Strategic Portfolio Return for the Performance Period. Excess Return is
expressed in basis points. A simple average was calculated of the return for each year in the Performance Period.

Performance Criterion 3
 

 
•  3-Year Pre-Tax Equivalent Net Investment Income Yield (weighted 50%). This was computed by taking a simple average of the Pre-Tax

Equivalent Net Investment Income Yield for the Performance Period. The calculation was determined as follows:

(a) Pre-Tax Equivalent Net Investment Income, divided by

(b) the average of Total Investments for the Performance Period.

Pre-Tax Equivalent Net Investment Income was computed by dividing:

(a) Net Investment Income on an after-tax basis taking into consideration tax deductions for tax-preferenced net investment income by

(b) the sum of 100% minus Kemper’s federal income tax rate.

Performance Criterion 4
 

 
•  The Performance Criteria are the three-year average of Kemper’s consolidated (1) Revenue Growth (weighted 20%); and (2) Return

on Equity (weighted 80%), as defined below. The Performance Criteria are subject to a Catastrophe Loss Collar as defined below:

Revenue Growth is defined as the three-year compound annual growth rate, calculated as (A/B)^(1/3)-1, where A = Total Revenues
excluding Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings as reported in Kemper’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and B = Total Revenues excluding Net Realized Gains on Sales of Investments
and Net Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings as reported in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2014.

Table of Contents

Return on Equity is defined as the return on average shareholders’ equity, which shall be computed by dividing the sum of GAAP Net
Income, subject to the Catastrophe Loss Collar, as reported in Kemper’s Annual Reports for each of the three years in the Performance
Period by the sum of the Average Shareholders’ Equity for each of the three years.

Average Shareholders’ Equity is defined as the simple average of Total Shareholders’ Equity as reported in Kemper’s Annual Reports,
subject to the Catastrophe Loss Collar, for the beginning and end of year for each year.

The Catastrophe Loss Collar shall be computed as follows:

(a) If Catastrophe Losses and associated Loss Adjustment Expenses (“LAE”) (including Catastrophe reserve development) reported by the
Property & Casualty Insurance segment (“Reported Catastrophe Losses and LAE”) are greater than 1.5 times the “Expected Catastrophe
Losses and LAE” (as defined below) for the Property & Casualty Insurance segment (“Maximum Catastrophe Losses and LAE”), Net
Income shall be increased by an amount equal to the after-tax difference between the Reported Catastrophe Losses and LAE and the
Maximum Catastrophe Losses and LAE;

(b) If Reported Catastrophe Losses and LAE are less than 0.5 times the Expected Catastrophe Losses and LAE for the Property & Casualty
Insurance segment (“Minimum Catastrophe Losses and LAE”), Net Income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the after-tax difference
between the Minimum Catastrophe Losses and LAE and the Reported Catastrophe Losses and LAE; or

(c) If Reported Catastrophe Losses and LAE are less than the Maximum Catastrophe Losses and LAE and greater than the Minimum
Catastrophe Loss and LAE, no adjustment shall be made to Net Income.

INFINITY PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

As discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, holders of shares of Infinity common stock will consider and vote on a proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “merger proposal”). The approval by such shareholders of this proposal is required under Ohio law and Infinity’s
Articles and is a condition to the closing. Infinity shareholders should read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety for more
detailed information concerning the Merger Agreement and the Merger. In particular, such shareholders should read in its entirety the Merger
Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as it is the legal document that governs the Merger. See “The Merger”
and “The Merger Agreement.”

The Infinity Board unanimously recommends that Infinity shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

If a holder of shares of Infinity common stock returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such shareholder’s
proxy card, such shareholder’s shares of Infinity common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal.

The approval by Infinity shareholders of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of Infinity shareholders entitled to exercise a majority
of the voting power of Infinity in favor of the proposal at the Infinity special meeting. Accordingly, an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the
failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give
voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record, or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.

INFINITY PROPOSAL 2: NON-BINDING COMPENSATION ADVISORY PROPOSAL

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of Dodd-Frank, Infinity is required to provide its shareholders the opportunity
to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Infinity’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger,” including the table entitled “‘Golden Parachute’ Compensation Disclosure” and accompanying footnotes. Accordingly, Infinity
shareholders are being provided the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on such payments (the “non-binding compensation advisory proposal”).

As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon Infinity or the Infinity Board, and approval of this proposal is not a condition to the closing.
Because the Merger-related executive compensation to be paid in connection with the Merger is based on the terms of the Merger Agreement as well as
the contractual arrangements with Infinity’s named executive officers, such compensation will be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory
vote, if the Merger Agreement is adopted (subject only to the contractual conditions applicable thereto). However, Infinity seeks the support of its
shareholders and believes that shareholder support is appropriate because Infinity has a comprehensive executive compensation program designed to
link the compensation of its executives with Infinity’s performance and the interests of Infinity shareholders. Accordingly, holders of Infinity common
stock are being asked to vote on the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation that is based on or otherwise relates
to the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” (which disclosure includes the Golden Parachute Compensation table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”

The Infinity Board unanimously recommends that Infinity shareholders vote “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

If an Infinity shareholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such shareholder’s proxy card, such
shareholder’s shares of Infinity common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

The approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast on the proposal,
provided that a quorum is present. Accordingly, an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds his or
her shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other
nominee holder of record or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the non-binding compensation
advisory proposal as these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast” with respect to the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

The vote on the non-binding compensation advisory proposal is advisory only and, therefore, not binding on Infinity or Kemper or any of their
respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Infinity shareholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to Infinity’s named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.

INFINITY PROPOSAL 3: MEETING ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

Holders of shares of Infinity common stock may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the Infinity special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
to a later date or time, but for no longer than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate, including to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement (the “Infinity meeting adjournment proposal”).

The Infinity Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

If an Infinity shareholder returns a properly executed proxy card, but does not indicate instructions on such shareholder’s proxy card, such
shareholder’s shares of Infinity common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.

The approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast on the proposal, provided that a
quorum is present. Accordingly, an Infinity shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of an Infinity shareholder who holds his or her shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee
holder of record or any other failure of an Infinity shareholder to vote will have no effect on the approval of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal.
The approval by Infinity shareholders of the Infinity meeting adjournment proposal is not a condition to the closing.

In addition, if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy or by use of communications equipment at the special meeting entitled to vote on such matter may adjourn the
meeting to another place, date or time. In this case, an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn
the meeting due to an absence of a quorum. At any subsequent reconvening of the Infinity special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner
as the proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Infinity special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked
or withdrawn prior to the subsequent meeting.

THE MERGER

The following is a description of the material aspects of the Merger. While the following description covers the material terms of the Merger, the
description may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You are encouraged to read carefully this entire joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the Merger Agreement attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, for a more complete understanding
of the Merger.

General

On February 13, 2018, the Kemper Board and the Infinity Board each approved the Merger Agreement, attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Infinity, with Infinity continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper. Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, as of the effective time, each share of Infinity common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than
shares owned by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common
stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares under Ohio law) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, upon the terms provided in the Merger Agreement and as described below under “The Merger Agreement—Merger
Consideration.”

Background of the Merger

Members of each of the Infinity Board and the Kemper Board and each of Infinity’s and Kemper’s respective senior management, acting
independently, regularly evaluate and consider the historical performance, future growth prospects, overall strategic goals and objectives and various
opportunities to enhance shareholder and stockholder value of Infinity and Kemper, respectively, in the context of developments in their respective
industries and the competitive landscape in the markets in which they respectively operate and elsewhere. As part of Infinity’s ongoing process, the
senior management of Infinity has at times presented to and discussed with the Infinity Board and individual members of the Infinity Board various
potential strategic alternatives involving possible business combinations that could complement and enhance Infinity’s competitive strengths and
strategic positions. As part of Kemper’s ongoing process, Kemper from time to time, both independently and with the input of various investment banks
and other advisors, evaluates potential transactions and other strategic actions, including strategic acquisitions, that could further its strategic objectives
and complement and enhance its competitive strengths and strategic positions, in addition to organic growth potential and other matters.

In this regard, various members of each of the Infinity Board and the Kemper Board and each of Infinity’s and Kemper’s respective senior
management, acting independently, have from time to time met or otherwise communicated informally with representatives of other financial and
property and casualty insurance institutions, including other companies in the property and casualty insurance industry, regarding industry trends and
issues, developments in the regulation of financial institutions and property and casualty insurance institutions, and the competitive insurance landscape
and the business strategy, strategic direction, performance and future growth prospects of their respective companies, including on occasion discussing
the possible benefits and issues arising from potential business combinations or other strategic transactions.

Infinity was among the institutions with which members of Kemper’s senior management had informal communications from time to time.
Specifically, Joseph P. Lacher, Jr., a member of the Kemper Board and the President and Chief Executive Officer of Kemper, and James R. Gober, the
Chairman of the Infinity Board and then the Chief Executive Officer of Infinity, met on an informal basis at industry events and otherwise to discuss
industry developments and other matters. On March 20, 2017, while attending one such industry event in New York, New York, at Mr. Lacher’s
suggestion, Mr. Lacher and Mr. Gober met prior to the beginning of the event

to discuss industry developments and their respective companies in general, as well as the possibility of their companies engaging in cross-selling or
cross-marketing activities in the future. The two did not specifically raise the possibility of or otherwise discuss any business combination transaction
between their respective companies.

Over the course of May, June and July 2017, as part of its ongoing evaluation process and the implementation of its corporate strategy, Kemper
completed internal analyses and solicited general input from, and had discussions with, eleven investment banks that were not then formally engaged for
such purposes, including Goldman Sachs, regarding possible strategic actions and other options to enhance near and long-term stockholder value.
Following review of the possible strategic actions and other options presented, Kemper’s senior management reached a preliminary consensus that a
relatively large-scale acquisition of a company or business focusing on non-standard automobile insurance had the potential to create the greatest
strategic advantage and the most stockholder value because it may provide, among other things, the same benefits of executing Kemper’s current
strategic plan while enhancing strategic positioning and presenting modest distraction risk.

Starting in July 2017, members of Kemper’s senior management began communicating regularly regarding such matters with representatives of
Goldman Sachs, with whom they had similar discussions in the preceding months. Kemper’s senior management also began reviewing potential targets
for a relatively large-scale complementary acquisition in the private passenger automobile insurance segment. In particular, Kemper discussed and
reviewed with Goldman Sachs the possibility of Infinity as a potential target for an acquisition opportunity. While Kemper reviewed numerous potential
targets, Infinity had consistently been presented by the participating investment banks as the leading choice for such an acquisition. In connection with
this review, Kemper’s senior management, after considering the advice of Kemper’s financial advisors, reached a preliminary consensus that Kemper
should explore Infinity as a potential target for an acquisition opportunity.

Over the course of July and early August 2017, prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the Kemper Board on August 2, 2017, Mr. Lacher held
informal discussions with various members of the Kemper Board regarding Kemper’s ongoing evaluation of various possible strategic actions and other
options, including a potential business combination involving Infinity.

On August 2, 2017, the Kemper Board held an in-person regularly scheduled meeting, attended also by members of Kemper’s senior management.
During the meeting, Kemper’s senior management led a discussion with the Kemper Board regarding corporate development opportunities, particularly
including Infinity. To begin, Mr. Lacher reviewed with the Kemper Board the progress to date on Kemper’s corporate strategy, including the
advancement or completion of various phases of such strategy. Mr. Lacher noted to the Kemper Board that, with such phases of the corporate strategy
underway or complete, Kemper had begun to review opportunities to enhance near and long-term stockholder value through strategic acquisitions.
Mr. Lacher provided an overview of the various possible strategic actions and other options presented to Kemper’s senior management and the criteria
used by Kemper’s senior management to evaluate them, as described above. Mr. Lacher reviewed with the Kemper Board factors that appeared to make
a potential complementary acquisition in the private passenger automobile insurance segment a good opportunity and Infinity a good fit as a potential
acquisition target, including: (i) increased scale if Kemper’s and Infinity’s respective existing non-standard automobile insurance businesses were
integrated; (ii) further access to growing segments; (iii) Infinity’s management and operational teams’ experience with respect to non-standard
automobile insurance; (iv) the appeal of non-standard automobile insurance as a space in which to compete and grow; and (v) expense synergy
opportunities. Mr. Lacher further noted reasons why Kemper should be seen as an attractive suiter for Infinity. James J. McKinney, the Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Kemper, then provided an overview of Infinity and certain aspects of a potential business combination,
including: (a) a review of Infinity’s recent financial performance; (b) a comparison of Kemper’s, Infinity’s and other companies’ non-standard
automobile insurance businesses in certain states; (c) a summary of areas of potential cost synergies; and (d) a presentation of the pro forma impact of
such a potential strategic transaction on Kemper common stock based on illustrative control premiums relative to the then current price of shares of
Infinity common stock. Mr. McKinney additionally reviewed with the

Kemper Board possibilities for financing such a business combination. The Kemper Board then discussed, with the input of Kemper’s senior
management, the impact of such a potential strategic transaction on Kemper’s short and long-term financial flexibility. Mr. Lacher then, at the request of
the Kemper Board, outlined his proposal for how to approach Infinity regarding discussions with respect to a potential strategic transaction, including by
reaching out to Infinity’s senior management and proposing an informal meeting to raise the possibility of a strategic transaction, which, if well
received, would be followed by a more detailed meeting and discussion between the parties. Kemper’s senior management then indicated that they were
inclined to have Kemper engage Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor to provide advice and assistance in connection with any such potential strategic
transaction because it would have industry and segment experience, among other things, and the Kemper Board indicated its support of such
engagement. Following discussion, the Kemper Board declared that Mr. Lacher had the support of the Kemper Board to initiate discussions with Infinity
regarding a potential business combination.

In mid-August 2017, members of Kemper’s senior management communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that Kemper intended to
engage Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor in connection with any potential strategic transaction between Kemper and Infinity in the event that
discussions and a process moved forward. Members of Kemper’s senior management subsequently worked together with representatives of Goldman
Sachs to plan reaching out to Infinity’s senior management. Goldman Sachs provided relationship disclosure on December 29, 2017 and February 12,
2018, which indicated that during the prior two-year period the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs did not perform any financial advisory
and/or underwriting services for Infinity or any of its affiliates for which Goldman Sachs received compensation. On February 11, 2018, Kemper entered
into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs for Goldman Sachs to provide financial advisory services with respect to a potential strategic transaction
between Kemper and Infinity.

On August 21 and 22, 2017, Mr. Lacher initiated a series of telephone conversations with Mr. Gober, who remained the Chairman of the Infinity
Board and had been succeeded as Chief Executive Officer of Infinity by Glen N. Godwin on August 1, 2017, to raise the possibility of a strategic
transaction between Kemper and Infinity and to gauge Infinity’s interest in taking part in such a potential strategic transaction. The two had not
previously specifically discussed the potential benefits of a strategic transaction or engaged in any formal merger discussions. Following these
conversations, Mr. Gober briefed members of Infinity senior management.

Mr. Lacher and Mr. Gober agreed to schedule a meeting in Florida in October 2017 to discuss industry developments and strategic opportunities in
the marketplace for Kemper and Infinity, including the possibility of a strategic transaction between Kemper and Infinity.

On October 9, 2017, Mr. Lacher had a dinner meeting with Messrs. Gober and Godwin in Doral, Florida to discuss trends in the property and
casualty insurance industry and the possibility of a strategic transaction between Kemper and Infinity. These discussions covered the respective
companies’ product lines, office locations, strategic opportunities in the marketplace, geographic focus and evolving requirements in technology and
analytics. The individuals agreed to meet again together with certain other members of their respective companies’ senior management teams to further
discuss the possibility of a strategic transaction between Kemper and Infinity and, in the meantime, to negotiate and enter into a confidentiality
agreement with respect thereto.

On October 16, 2017, following negotiations, the companies entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement, pursuant to which each company
would keep certain information regarding the other party confidential. The confidentiality agreement also included a standstill provision restricting each
party, for a period of eighteen months, from purchasing the other party’s capital stock or taking certain other actions that may lead to a business
combination, unless approved by the applicable company’s board of directors. The standstill provision was subject to a “fall away” term providing for
the expiration of such restrictions if the other party entered into a definitive agreement to consummate a change of control transaction.

On October 18, 2017, Mr. Lacher, Mr. McKinney, Mark A. Green, the Senior Vice President and President, Life and Health Division, of Kemper,
George D. Dufala, Jr., then the Senior Vice President and President, Property and Casualty Division, of Kemper, and C. Thomas Evans, Jr., the Senior
Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of Kemper, met in Atlanta, Georgia with Mr. Gober, Mr. Godwin, Samuel J. Simon, the President and
General Counsel of Infinity, and Robert H. Bateman, the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Infinity. At the meeting, Mr. Lacher set
forth his vision for growing Kemper’s non-standard automobile insurance business, including the possibility of Infinity and Kemper engaging in a
strategic transaction. While no material terms upon which a potential strategic transaction could be completed had been discussed in detail to date, the
parties briefly discussed in general terms the possibility of the addition of one or more members of the Infinity Board to the Kemper Board in
connection with the closing of any such potential strategic transaction. At the conclusion of the meeting, both parties expressed interest in continuing
discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction, and the representatives of Infinity noted that they would inform the Infinity Board of their
discussions in connection with its upcoming meeting.

Following the meeting, Mr. Lacher briefed the Chairman of the Kemper Board on the discussions and Messrs. Gober, Godwin, Simon and
Bateman briefed Mr. Samuel Weinhoff, the lead independent director of the Infinity Board, on the discussions.

On October 21, 2017, Mr. Lacher contacted Mr. Godwin to reiterate Kemper’s interest in continuing discussions regarding a potential strategic
transaction.

During the week of October 23, 2017, members of Infinity’s senior management discussed with Mr. Weinhoff Kemper’s continued interest and
Mr. Weinhoff agreed to schedule a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Infinity Board, comprised of Messrs. Weinhoff and Gober, Mr. Victor T.
Adamo, Mr. Richard J. Bielen and Ms. Teresa A. Canida (the “Executive Committee”), on October 25, 2017. Mr. Weinhoff also contacted
representatives of Deutsche Bank that week to discuss the possibility of having Infinity engage Deutsche Bank as a financial advisor in connection with
any potential strategic transaction between Infinity and Kemper in the event that discussions and a process moved forward, subject to Deutsche Bank
providing relationships disclosure to the Infinity Board that was satisfactory to the Infinity Board. As described below, on December 21, 2017, Deutsche
Bank provided relationships disclosure that indicated that, since January 1, 2015, Deutsche Bank or its affiliates had received less than €100,000 in fees
for investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Kemper or its affiliates.

On October 25, 2017, the Executive Committee of the Infinity Board met to discuss the potential strategic transaction and the discussions between
Kemper’s senior management and Infinity’s senior management. The Executive Committee agreed to put these discussions on the agenda for the formal
meeting of the Infinity Board on November 1 and 2.

On November 1 and 2, 2017, at an in-person regularly scheduled meeting of the Infinity Board in Orlando, Florida attended by members of
Infinity’s senior management, representatives of Keating Muething & Klekamp PLL, legal advisor to Infinity (“KMK”), and representatives of Deutsche
Bank, which, as described below, was eventually engaged as financial advisor to Infinity, Messrs. Gober, Godwin and Simon outlined for the Infinity
Board the communications between Infinity’s senior management and Kemper’s senior management in October 2017 regarding Kemper’s interest in a
potential strategic transaction with Infinity. After discussion of Infinity’s business prospects and the strategic plan that had previously been reviewed by
the Infinity Board earlier in 2017, the Infinity Board requested that Infinity’s senior management update Infinity’s strategic plan and that Deutsche Bank
also review. Infinity’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed with the Infinity Board Infinity’s and Kemper’s respective
businesses, current stock market valuations of the companies and other preliminary financial information. The Infinity Board asked questions, including
whether other indications of interest had been solicited or received. Senior management confirmed that no other indications of interest had been solicited
or received. Representatives of KMK reviewed with the Infinity Board the fiduciary duties under Ohio law with respect to the consideration of a
potential strategic transaction between Infinity and Kemper.

Following discussion, the Infinity Board authorized Infinity’s senior management to work with Deutsche Bank and KMK to engage in further
exploratory discussions with Kemper and to prepare for Kemper’s due diligence of Infinity.

On November 1, 2017, the Kemper Board held an in-person regularly scheduled meeting, attended also by members of Kemper’s senior
management. At the meeting, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board with an update of the status of recent developments and discussions regarding a
potential strategic transaction with Infinity. Mr. McKinney then provided a preliminary overview of certain financial considerations in connection with
such a potential strategic transaction based on publicly available information. Mr. Lacher and Mr. McKinney then reviewed the terms of a draft written
initial non-binding offer letter for the proposed acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Infinity at a proposed purchase price in the range of
$112.92 to $122.33 per share of Infinity common stock to be payable in a combination of cash (in an amount between 40% and 50% of the total
consideration) and shares of Kemper common stock determined pursuant to a fixed exchange ratio (in an amount between 50% and 60% of the total
consideration), which was prepared by Kemper’s senior management with the assistance of Kemper’s advisors. The Kemper Board then discussed, with
the input of Kemper’s senior management, the potential benefits of such a potential strategic transaction, the relative merits of acquisitions and organic
growth, the execution risks involved in completing such a potential strategic transaction and the requirements of successfully integrating the operations
and achieving the potential synergies outlined in the preliminary overview. The Kemper Board indicated its support of the delivery to Infinity of the
initial non-binding offer letter. Mr. McKinney then provided an overview of possible next steps in discussions with Infinity and discussed with the
Kemper Board the engagement by Kemper of Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor and Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley Austin”) as legal advisor to provide
advice and assistance in connection with the potential strategic transaction, with respect to which the Kemper Board again indicated its support. The
Kemper Board then discussed the potential changes to the composition of the Kemper Board, including the addition of one or more members of the
Infinity Board, that could result in connection with such a potential strategic transaction.

On November 2, 2017, Kemper delivered a written initial non-binding offer letter to Infinity. This initial non-binding offer letter was for the
proposed acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Infinity and reflected a proposed purchase price in the range of $112.92 to $122.33 per share
of Infinity common stock, which Kemper indicated represented a total approximate value in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.36 billion (based on an
assumption of the number of fully diluted outstanding shares, including outstanding unvested restricted and performance shares), to be payable in a
combination of cash (in an amount between 40% and 50% of the total consideration) and shares of Kemper common stock (in an amount between 50%
and 60% of the total consideration), with the stock component to be determined pursuant to a fixed exchange ratio and likely to be tax-free to Infinity
shareholders, subject to the election of each Infinity shareholder and with customary adjustments if either form of consideration became oversubscribed.
The initial non-binding offer letter additionally specified that such a potential strategic transaction would not be subject to any Kemper financing
contingencies, but would be subject to customary closing conditions for a public company transaction, including receipt of applicable insurance
regulatory approvals. In the initial non-binding offer letter, Kemper further noted that it would be open to discussions at an appropriate time regarding
adding one or more members of the Infinity Board to the Kemper Board following the closing of the potential strategic transaction.

The Executive Committee of the Infinity Board formed a committee of the Infinity Board to remain in contact with senior management with
respect to developments regarding Kemper’s initial non-binding offer letter (the “Term Sheet Committee”). The Term Sheet Committee consisted of
Mr. Weinhoff (Chair), Mr. Adamo, Mr. Bielen, Ms. Canida and Mr. James L. Weidner. Members of the Term Sheet Committee were selected by the
Infinity Board because of their independence and experience with strategic transactions generally. The Term Sheet Committee was responsible for
remaining in contact with Infinity’s senior management and Infinity’s advisors with respect to developments in Kemper’s non-binding offer letter.
Infinity senior management would inform Mr. Weinhoff of the thoughts of Infinity’s senior management and financial and legal advisors regarding
Kemper’s non-binding indications of interest and negotiations of the Merger Agreement. Mr. Weinhoff would

keep the Term Sheet Committee members informed and relay the Term Sheet Committee’s thoughts on certain developments and issues of the Merger
Agreement to Infinity’s senior management.

During the period from November 4 to 9, 2017, Mr. Bateman and representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke regarding Infinity’s updated business
plan, as developed by Infinity’s senior management, and the Infinity Board informally discussed the initial non-binding offer letter, including the range
of the proposed purchase price.

On November 8, 2017, a representative of Deutsche Bank provided Infinity’s reaction to Kemper’s initial non-binding offer letter to both
Mr. Lacher and representatives of Goldman Sachs. At the Infinity Board’s direction, the representative of Deutsche Bank expressed Infinity’s desire for,
and indicated that the provision of substantive due diligence information and materials by Infinity was conditioned upon, Kemper narrowing the range
and increasing the amounts set forth therein for its proposed purchase price, noting the strong stock price reaction to the release of Infinity’s earnings
with respect to the third quarter of 2017 on November 6, 2017.

On November 14, 2017, following informal discussions between members of Kemper’s senior management and various members of the Kemper
Board, Kemper delivered to Infinity a written revised non-binding offer letter for the proposed acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Infinity.
This revised non-binding offer letter proposed a purchase price at least in the range of $120.61 to $125.16 per share of Infinity common stock, which
Kemper indicated represented a total approximate value at least in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.375 billion (based on an assumption of the number
of fully diluted outstanding shares, including outstanding unvested restricted and performance shares), and reaffirmed that the consideration would be
payable in a combination of cash (in an amount between 40% and 50% of the total consideration) and shares of Kemper common stock (in an amount
between 50% and 60% of the total consideration), with the stock component to be determined pursuant to a fixed exchange ratio determined at or near
the time of announcement of the potential strategic transaction and likely to be tax-free to Infinity shareholders, subject to election of each Infinity
shareholder and with customary adjustments if either form of consideration became oversubscribed. The revised non-binding offer letter reaffirmed that
such potential strategic transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions for a public company transaction, including receipt of applicable
insurance regulatory approvals, and that Kemper would be open to discussions at an appropriate time regarding adding one or more members of the
Infinity Board to the Kemper Board following the closing of the potential strategic transaction.

On November 21, 2017, at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Infinity Board also attended by representatives of Deutsche Bank and
Infinity’s senior management, Infinity’s senior management presented its updated business plan to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee
discussed the updated business plan with representatives of Deutsche Bank and asked questions of senior management. Infinity’s senior management
also briefed the Executive Committee of the Infinity Board regarding the status of negotiations with Kemper, and the Executive Committee of the
Infinity Board decided to request a special meeting of the full Infinity Board to discuss how to proceed with the revised non-binding offer letter and a
potential strategic transaction with Kemper. The Infinity Board and representatives of Deutsche Bank also discussed certain preliminary financial
information relating to Infinity.

On November 30, 2017, at a special in-person meeting called in response to the request from the Executive Committee, the Infinity Board
discussed developments regarding a potential strategic transaction with Kemper since the November 1, 2017 Infinity Board meeting, strategic
considerations related to the updated business plan and Infinity’s response to certain points in Kemper’s revised non-binding offer letter, including
Kemper’s proposed purchase price and the exchanging of information with Kemper related to its due diligence of Infinity and the need for reverse due
diligence of Kemper at an appropriate point in time. Representatives of Deutsche Bank were also present. Infinity’s management and the Infinity Board
then reviewed a draft of the Infinity financial projections with a view to sharing them with Kemper and approved the engagement of Deutsche Bank as
financial advisor to Infinity. Infinity management and the Infinity Board agreed that it would not be appropriate for Kemper representatives to meet or
speak with Infinity management below the senior management level until discussions between Infinity and Kemper progressed further.

On December 5, 2017, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board a written update of the status of recent developments and discussions regarding a
potential strategic transaction with Infinity. The written update noted that Goldman Sachs had received and answered a number of questions from
Deutsche Bank since the revised non-binding offer letter was delivered by Kemper on November 14, 2017 and that Deutsche Bank had informed
Goldman Sachs that Kemper would receive a counter-offer from Infinity, after which discussions between Mr. Lacher and Mr. Weinhoff, the Lead
Director of Infinity and Chair of the Term Sheet Committee, and a meeting of the Kemper Board, were contemplated.

Also on December 5, 2017, at the request of the Term Sheet Committee, with the support of the Infinity Board, Deutsche Bank prepared, on behalf
of Infinity, a draft written preliminary non-binding term sheet for the proposed acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Infinity that
contemplated a proposed purchase price of $132.00 per share of Infinity common stock. The preliminary non-binding term sheet also proposed that 50%
to 60% of the consideration would be payable in cash and 40% to 50% of the consideration would be payable in shares of Kemper common stock, with
the stock component to be determined based on a fixed exchange ratio with respect to the volume-weighted average trading price of Kemper common
stock during the 20 trading days prior to the announcement of such a potential strategic transaction subject to a 15% collar and likely to be tax-free to
Infinity shareholders. The preliminary non-binding term sheet further specified that the definitive agreement would not include any closing condition
related to Kemper’s ability to obtain acquisition financing and would include customary break-up and reverse break-up fees and customary “fiduciary
out” provisions. Infinity received and considered input on the preliminary non-binding term sheet from the Term Sheet Committee, KMK and Deutsche
Bank. On December 7, 2017, with the support of the Infinity Board, Deutsche Bank delivered Infinity’s preliminary non-binding term sheet to Kemper.

Later on December 5, 2017, following receipt of the preliminary non-binding term sheet delivered on behalf of Infinity on December 7, 2017,
members of Kemper’s senior management held informal discussions with various members of the Kemper Board.

On December 8, 2017, Deutsche Bank delivered to Infinity a draft engagement letter pursuant to which Infinity would engage Deutsche Bank as
Infinity’s exclusive financial advisor with respect to an exploration of strategic alternatives, including a potential strategic transaction with Kemper. In
connection with finalizing the engagement letter, on December 21, 2017, Deutsche Bank provided a relationships disclosure to the Infinity Board as of
December 21, 2017 that indicated that, since January 1, 2015, Deutsche Bank or its affiliates had received less than €100,000 in fees for investment
banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Kemper or its affiliates. Deutsche Bank again provided relationships disclosure on
February 9, 2018, which similarly indicated that Deutsche Bank or its affiliates had received less than €100,000 in fees for investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to Kemper or its affiliates. Infinity agreed to the final terms of, and the parties executed, the
engagement letter on December 21, 2017.

On December 12, 2017, following a discussion between Mr. Lacher and a representative of Deutsche Bank, Mr. Lacher and Mr. Weinhoff had a
telephone conversation, during which Mr. Weinhoff requested that Kemper consider increasing the amounts in the range for the purchase price per share
of Infinity common stock that was previously proposed by Kemper. Mr. Lacher indicated that more detailed due diligence of Infinity, including the
provision of additional due diligence information and materials by Infinity, would be required before Kemper would consider increasing the amounts in
its proposed purchase price range. Mr. Lacher and Mr. Weinhoff also briefly discussed in general terms the possibility of the addition of one or more
members of the Infinity Board to the Kemper Board in connection with the closing of any such potential strategic transaction. Mr. Lacher and
Mr. Weinhoff agreed that the management of each company should meet in person to review Infinity’s financial plan and reserves, as well as potential
synergies that could be realized from a potential strategic transaction and the value that such a potential strategic transaction could offer to the
companies’ respective stockholders.

On December 13, 2017, the Kemper Board held a telephonic special meeting to discuss a potential strategic transaction with Infinity and recent
related developments, attended also by members of Kemper’s senior

management and representatives of Sidley Austin. At the meeting, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board with an update of the status of recent
developments and discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with Infinity, including his conversation on December 12, 2017 with
Mr. Weinhoff. The materials senior management provided the Kemper Board prior to the meeting included a proposed timeline with respect to the
proposed execution of a definitive agreement for such a potential strategic transaction in the event the process and discussions continued to move
forward. The Kemper Board then discussed, with the input of Kemper’s senior management, the preliminary non-binding term sheet delivered on behalf
of Infinity on December 7, 2017 and potential responses thereto, the financing of such a potential strategic transaction and the potential impact that
proposed changes in federal tax law could have on such a potential strategic transaction. At the request of the Kemper Board, representatives of Sidley
Austin then reviewed with the Kemper Board the proposed structure of such a potential strategic transaction, the fiduciary duties of directors in
considering such a potential strategic transaction and various regulatory matters involved in completing such a potential strategic transaction. The
meeting was concluded with Mr. Lacher noting to the Kemper Board that Kemper’s senior management would continue to provide updates regarding
developments and discussions with Infinity.

On December 19, 2017, Infinity provided Kemper with various due diligence materials and information regarding the topics to be discussed the
following day at a meeting involving Infinity and Kemper.

On December 20, 2017, Mr. Gober, Mr. Godwin, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bateman and representatives of Deutsche Bank met in Atlanta, Georgia with
Mr. Lacher, Mr. McKinney, Mr. Green, Kim Leggette, the Chief Claims Officer and then the co-interim President, Property and Casualty Division, of
Kemper, Mr. Evans and representatives of Goldman Sachs. While no material terms upon which a potential strategic transaction could be based were
discussed in detail at the meeting, Kemper reiterated at the outset that more detailed due diligence of Infinity would be required before Kemper would
consider an increase in the proposed purchase price, including in particular with respect to Infinity’s growth plans and projections. At the meeting, the
parties reviewed Infinity’s business, financial plan and reserves, as well as potential synergies that could be realized from a strategic transaction and the
value that such a potential strategic transaction could offer to the companies’ respective stockholders. Following the meeting, at the direction of Infinity,
a representative of Deutsche Bank provided Kemper, through Goldman Sachs, with additional information and materials regarding Infinity’s projected
growth in premiums and underwriting profitability of new and renewal business on a state-by-state basis, Infinity’s investment portfolio and a potential
repositioning of such portfolio and Infinity’s excess capital with respect to rating agency capital requirements. At the direction of Infinity, a
representative of Deutsche Bank also provided Kemper, through Goldman Sachs, with a copy of an Infinity product plan reviewed at the meeting.

On December 22, 2017, following further informal discussions between members of Kemper’s senior management and the Chairman of the
Kemper Board and with the assistance of Kemper’s advisors, Kemper delivered to Infinity a written revised preliminary non-binding term sheet for the
proposed acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of Infinity that contemplated a proposed purchase price in the range of $128.00 to $130.00 per
share of Infinity common stock, which Kemper indicated represented a total approximate value in the range of $1.406 billion to $1.428 billion (based on
an assumption of the number of fully diluted outstanding shares, including outstanding unvested restricted and performance shares). As set forth in the
revised preliminary non-binding term sheet, 40% of the consideration was proposed to be payable in cash and 60% of the consideration was proposed to
be payable in shares of Kemper common stock, with the stock component to be determined pursuant to a fixed exchange ratio without a collar and likely
to be taxable to Infinity shareholders, subject to election of each Infinity shareholder and with customary adjustments if either form of consideration
became oversubscribed. The revised preliminary non-binding term sheet confirmed that such a potential strategic transaction would not be subject to any
Kemper financing contingencies and further specified that the definitive agreement would include a customary break-up fee and a customary “fiduciary
out” provision, but no reverse break-up fee. Kemper proposed a targeted announcement date, subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation of a
definitive agreement and approval of the companies’ respective boards of directors, to coincide with Kemper’s targeted date for release of its fiscal year
2017 earnings in the event the process and discussions

continued to move forward. Kemper also proposed that the parties enter into an exclusivity arrangement effective through the targeted announcement
date.

On December 23, 2017, Mr. Weinhoff, Mr. Gober, Mr. Godwin, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bateman and representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed by
telephone Infinity’s response to the revised preliminary non-binding term sheet delivered by Kemper. Later that same day, a representatives of Deutsche
Bank contacted Mr. Lacher to propose a purchase price of $129.00 per share of Infinity common stock, representing the midpoint of Kemper’s
previously proposed purchase price range, with the other terms proposed in the revised preliminary non-binding term sheet delivered by Kemper on
December 22, 2017. The representative from Deutsche Bank indicated that Infinity desired to tentatively agree on a specific purchase price, rather than a
range with respect thereto, in order to proceed with further due diligence. The representative of Deutsche Bank and Mr. Lacher also further discussed the
completion of due diligence of both companies and the timing of the targeted announcement date with respect to the potential strategic transaction,
subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval of the companies’ respective boards of directors, in the event
the process and discussions continued to move forward.

Following the discussion on December 23, 2017, members of Kemper’s senior management briefed various members of the Kemper Board and
discussed Kemper’s response.

On December 27, 2017, Mr. Lacher informed a representative of Deutsche Bank that Infinity’s proposed purchase price of $129.00 per share of
Infinity common stock, with the other terms proposed in the revised preliminary non-binding term sheet delivered by Kemper on December 22, 2017,
was tentatively acceptable to Kemper based upon the companies’ discussions and due diligence completed to date, subject to completion of due
diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval of the companies’ respective boards of directors, and that Kemper desired to proceed with
further due diligence and negotiation of a definitive agreement for such a potential strategic transaction.

Also on December 27, 2017, the Infinity Board held a telephonic special meeting also attended by representatives of Deutsche Bank and
representatives of KMK. Representatives of Deutsche Bank reported that Mr. Lacher had informed them that a purchase price of $129.00 per share, with

subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval of the companies’ respective boards of directors. At the
Infinity Board’s request, representatives of KMK provided an overview of the fiduciary duties of the Infinity Board to Infinity and Infinity shareholders
regarding the potential strategic transaction and representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed certain preliminary financial information relating to Infinity.
The Infinity Board determined that Infinity should move to the next phase of Kemper’s due diligence investigation of Infinity and should commence
reverse due diligence of Kemper, so long as an agreement with respect to non-solicitation of employees was in place between Infinity and Kemper.
Finally, the Infinity Board approved entering into exclusive negotiations with Kemper regarding a potential strategic transaction.

On December 28, 2017, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board a written update of the status of recent developments and discussions regarding a

their respective fiscal year 2017 earnings. Mr. Lacher separately requested that Kemper be given access to additional Infinity employees for Kemper’s
due diligence of Infinity.

Between January 2 and 10, 2018, representatives of KMK and representatives of Sidley Austin negotiated the terms of (i) an exclusivity
agreement to be entered into between Infinity and Kemper under which Infinity would not solicit, negotiate or take other actions regarding certain
strategic transactions with any person other than Kemper for a specified time period (but providing for the ability of Infinity to engage in certain
discussions with third parties and provide third parties with certain confidential information about Infinity, in each case under certain circumstances) and
(ii) an amendment to the confidentiality agreement to be entered into between Infinity and Kemper under which the companies would not solicit for hire
the directors and certain of the employees of one another for a specified time period. On January 10, 2018, Infinity and Kemper entered into the
exclusivity agreement, which contemplated an exclusivity term expiring 10 days following Infinity’s release of its fiscal year 2017 earnings, subject to
the expiration of such term if Kemper proposed a purchase price for a potential strategic transaction that is less than $129.00 per share of Infinity
common stock or material modifications to other specified terms set forth in the revised preliminary non-binding term sheet delivered by Kemper on
December 22, 2017. Also on January 10, 2018, Infinity and Kemper entered into the amendment to the confidentiality agreement, which provided for an
employee and director non-solicitation term ending on the date that is 18 months following the date of the confidentiality agreement, subject to certain
customary exceptions. The parties also tentatively agreed on a targeted announcement date with respect to the potential strategic transaction, subject to
completion of due diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval of the companies’ respective boards of directors, to coincide with the
companies’ targeted date for release of their respective fiscal year 2017 earnings.

On January 11, 2018, in connection with the completion of due diligence, Infinity made available an electronic data room containing information
and materials to representatives of Kemper, Goldman Sachs, Sidley Austin and a consulting firm engaged by Kemper for such purposes.

On January 12, 2018, following negotiation, Infinity and Kemper entered into an addendum to the confidentiality agreement to further limit the
representatives of each party and their financial and legal advisors who would have access to certain to-be-specified confidential and sensitive
information of one another and to provide for redaction and aggregation of such information, in connection with the due diligence and reverse due
diligence processes. Such addendum was later amended and restated on January 29, 2018 to provide for redaction and aggregation of such information
to be completed by a single specified third party.

Later on January 12, 2018, Infinity began providing additional information and materials requested by Kemper to assist in its due diligence of
Infinity. Infinity and Kemper, with the assistance of their financial and legal advisors, continued to conduct, through February 13, 2018, mutual due
diligence through their respective electronic data rooms and otherwise, as applicable. Also during this period, the two companies and their financial
advisors continued to discuss the various sources for and amounts of synergy opportunities and the ability to realize those opportunities over time, while
continuing to consider the validation of the expected long-term, positive synergies of a combination and the ability to achieve cost savings at the
combined company.

On January 17, 2018, the Kemper Board held a telephonic special meeting to discuss the proposed Merger and the draft Merger Agreement and
recent related developments, attended also by members of Kemper’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of
Sidley Austin. At the meeting, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board with an update of the status of recent developments and discussions regarding the
proposed Merger and potential next steps and timing. At the request of Kemper’s senior management, representatives of Sidley Austin reviewed with the
Kemper Board a summary of the key non-price provisions of a draft Merger Agreement that might be proposed to Infinity and areas of potential
negotiation with Infinity, including with respect to structure, regulatory closing conditions and the scope of each party’s commitment to seek and obtain

terms, treatment of Infinity’s outstanding equity awards and voting agreements. Representatives of Sidley Austin also discussed with the Kemper Board
the timing and various regulatory matters involved in completing such a potential strategic transaction. The Kemper Board indicated its support of
Kemper’s senior management delivering to Infinity a draft Merger Agreement containing key non-price provisions substantially consistent with the
summary of key non-price provisions presented to the Kemper Board and engage in negotiations with Infinity on its terms. The Kemper Board then
discussed the potential changes to the composition of the Kemper Board that could result in connection with the proposed Merger and declared that
Kemper’s senior management had the support of the Kemper Board to discuss with Infinity, at the appropriate time in the context of negotiations, the
addition of one member of the Infinity Board to the Kemper Board after the closing of the proposed Merger. The meeting was concluded with
Mr. Lacher noting to the Kemper Board that Kemper’s senior management would continue to provide updates regarding developments and discussions
with Infinity.

In the evening on January 19, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to KMK. Among
other provisions, the draft Merger Agreement provided for the structure of the proposed Merger, exceptions to Kemper’s commitment to seek and obtain
regulatory approvals (including as reflected the initial definition of a “materially burdensome condition”), “fiduciary out” exceptions to the non-
solicitation covenant, a termination fee equal to 4.50% of the total equity value of the proposed Merger payable by either party upon termination of the
Merger Agreement in certain specified circumstances, the conversion in the Merger of Infinity’s outstanding equity awards into Kemper equity awards,
conditions to Kemper’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the proposed Merger with respect to certain Infinity employee retention matters and the
tangible net worth of Infinity and other matters and an expectation that voting agreements would be requested from certain of each party’s directors and
officers. Prior to Sidley Austin sending such draft Merger Agreement to KMK, on January 19, 2018, members of Kemper’s senior management sent
communications to Mr. Simon to preview the closing condition with respect to Infinity employee retention matters contained in such draft Merger
Agreement. Such draft Merger Agreement did not contain any undertaking on the part of Kemper with respect to the addition of any members of the
Infinity Board to the Kemper Board after the closing of the proposed Merger.

On January 20, 2018, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bateman, representatives of KMK and representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke by telephone to discuss the
proposed closing conditions with respect to Infinity employee retention matters contained in Kemper’s draft Merger Agreement. On January 21, 2018,
KMK delivered to Sidley Austin a letter regarding such closing conditions, which proposed that such closing conditions be removed and replaced by
certain covenants regarding entry into employment agreements with certain Infinity employees and notification of any termination of employment of
certain Infinity employees, in each case following entry into the Merger Agreement. The letter also noted that Infinity would be willing to coordinate
meetings to allow Kemper to enter into retention agreements with certain Infinity employees. The delivery of the letter was followed by discussions
between members of Infinity’s senior management and members of Kemper’s senior management regarding the matters addressed therein.

On January 24 and 25, 2018, Mr. Gober, Mr. Godwin, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bateman, approximately 37 other members of Infinity’s management and
representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Mr. Lacher, Mr. McKinney, Mr. Green, Mr. Evans, approximately 22 other members of Kemper’s
management, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of a consulting firm engaged by Kemper for due diligence purposes in Atlanta,
Georgia to further due diligence efforts through discussions of Infinity’s operations, financial condition and other matters. Representatives of both KMK
and Sidley Austin participated in certain of such meetings by telephone. In connection with the meetings, Infinity’s management provided to Kemper’s
management the Infinity financial projections.

On January 25, 2018, in connection with the completion of reverse due diligence, Kemper made available an electronic data room containing

Mr. McKinney, Mr. Green, Mr. Evans, other members of Kemper’s management, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Sidley Austin

During the meetings, members of Infinity’s senior management additionally discussed with members of Kemper’s senior management material issues in
and related to Kemper’s initial draft of the Merger Agreement.

Later on January 30, 2018, KMK, on behalf of Infinity, delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley Austin. Such revised draft
provided for limited exceptions to Kemper’s commitment to seek and obtain regulatory approvals (including as reflected in the definition of a
“materially burdensome condition”), expanded “fiduciary out” exceptions to the non-solicitation covenant, a termination fee equal to 2.00% of the total
equity value of the proposed Merger, a reverse termination fee payable by Kemper in the event that Infinity terminated the Merger Agreement upon the
occurrence of the outside date and Kemper failing to comply with its commitment to seek and obtain regulatory approvals and the automatic vesting of
Infinity’s outstanding equity awards consistent with the terms of the equity plan pursuant to which such awards were granted. Such revised draft
reflected the removal of the closing conditions with respect to Infinity employee retention matters and the tangible net worth of Infinity and did not
include any provisions relating to the addition of any members of the Infinity Board to the Kemper Board after the closing of the proposed Merger.

During the period from January 30, 2018 through the first week of February 2018, Kemper’s management provided to Infinity’s senior
management and representatives of Deutsche Bank certain key items from the Kemper financial projections and certain updated financial information
relating thereto, as more fully described in the section entitled “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 269.

On February 2, 2018, Sidley Austin sent a non-exhaustive list of the material open issues in Infinity’s revised draft of the Merger Agreement to
KMK. Later on February 2, 2018, representatives of Sidley Austin and KMK, together with general counsels of both Infinity and Kemper, spoke by
telephone to discuss material open issues in Infinity’s revised draft of the Merger Agreement.

On February 5, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to KMK. Such revised draft
provided for a termination fee equal to 3.50% of the total equity value of the proposed Merger, no reverse termination fee and closing conditions with
respect to Infinity employee retention matters and the tangible net worth of Infinity. Such revised draft expressly reserved any revisions with respect to
the treatment of Infinity’s outstanding equity awards pending further discussion between the parties.

On February 7, 2018, Infinity’s Executive Committee held a telephonic special meeting to discuss with Mr. Gober, other senior management and
KMK the ongoing negotiations surrounding the draft Merger Agreement. Mr. Gober reported on the progress of due diligence meetings and the
remaining open issues in the draft Merger Agreement.

Also on February 7, 2018, the Kemper Board held an in-person regularly scheduled meeting, attended also by members of Kemper’s senior
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Sidley Austin. At the meeting, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board with
an update of the status of developments and discussions regarding the proposed Merger, including the parties’ due diligence efforts and negotiations
with respect to open issues in and related to the draft Merger Agreement regarding closing certainty, employee retention, treatment of Infinity’s
outstanding equity awards and other matters. Mr. Lacher also led a discussion with the Kemper Board regarding proposed next steps and timing and
considerations related to the proposed Merger, including with respect to contemplated integration efforts. Mr. McKinney again provided the Kemper
Board with a summary of the key economic terms of the proposed Merger before providing an overview of certain financial considerations in

(without synergies), the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (with synergies) and the combined company financial projections, as more fully
described in the section entitled “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 269, and the Kemper Board indicated its
support of Goldman Sachs’ use of such financial projections in connection with its financial analysis relating to the proposed Merger Consideration.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Kemper Board Goldman Sachs’ preliminary financial analysis relating to the proposed
Merger Consideration. Mr. McKinney also discussed with the Kemper Board communications considerations in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the request of Kemper’s senior management, representatives of Sidley Austin then reviewed with the Kemper Board a summary of the key non-price
provisions of the draft Merger Agreement. During this review, representatives of Sidley Austin discussed with the Kemper Board the status of
negotiations between the parties with respect to open issues in the draft Merger Agreement and highlighted revisions to the draft Merger Agreement as a
result thereof. Representatives of Sidley Austin also reviewed with the Kemper Board an initial draft of the Infinity voting agreement, which was
proposed to reflect substantially similar obligations as those that would be set forth in the Kemper voting agreement. The Kemper Board then further
discussed, with the input of Kemper’s senior management and representatives from Goldman Sachs and Sidley Austin, proposed next steps and timing
with respect to the proposed Merger. The Kemper Board indicated its support of Kemper’s senior management continuing to negotiate the open issues in
the draft Merger Agreement and other draft transaction documents.

Later on February 7, 2018, following discussions between representatives of Deutsche Bank and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Lacher,
other members of Kemper’s senior management and representatives of Sidley Austin and Mr. Gober, Mr. Godwin, Mr. Simon, Mr. Bateman, other
members of Infinity’s senior management and representatives of KMK discussed by telephone the material open issues in the draft Merger Agreement.
During the discussion, the members of senior management tentatively agreed to certain conceptual terms regarding closing certainty and deal
protections. The members of senior management also discussed treatment of Infinity’s outstanding equity awards and certain other issues regarding
closing certainty, including with respect to the amount of the termination fee and Infinity employee retention. The members of senior management
additionally noted that each of the parties desired to work diligently to remain on schedule for the targeted announcement date with respect to the
proposed Merger, subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval of the companies’ respective boards of
directors, to coincide with the companies’ targeted dates for release of their respective fiscal year 2017 earnings.

Following the discussion, further to the negotiations regarding the open issues with respect to Infinity employee retention, Mr. Lacher contacted
Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Simon to discuss the possibility of such executives and certain other members of Infinity’s management entering into
retention agreements with Kemper or Infinity prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the addition of one member of the Infinity Board to the
Kemper Board after the closing of the proposed Merger, which member would be chosen by Kemper subject to the Kemper Board’s policies and
applicable rules and regulations. Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Simon tentatively agreed to the proposals and, after the discussion, members of
Kemper’s management delivered to them proposed term sheets with respect to such retention agreements. Such proposed term sheets regarding the
retention agreements between Kemper and each of Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Simon contemplated commitments with respect to each such
executive for the continuation of his employment with Infinity for a period of two years following the closing of the proposed Merger at an annual base
salary not less than such executive’s current annual base salary, the payment to such executive at the expiration of the retention agreement of a retention
bonus in the form of a lump-sum amount equal to the amount that would have been received by such executive had such executive been terminated for a
reason other than “Cause,” as set forth in such executive’s current employment agreement, and the granting to such executive after the completion of the
proposed Merger of a one-time award of time-vested restricted stock units with respect to Kemper common stock having a grant date value of
$1,000,000 that will vest in full provided that such executive has been continuously employed by Kemper or its subsidiaries at the expiration of the
retention agreement. Over the course of the next several days, Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Simon individually negotiated the terms of their
retention agreements with Kemper, as more fully described below and in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger,” in conjunction with the negotiation of, and agreement

on, the forms of the retention agreements between Infinity and certain other members of Infinity’s management and other covenants and the closing
condition with respect to Infinity employee retention in the draft Merger Agreement. These matters were of utmost importance to Kemper’s senior
management because of the value they attributed to Infinity’s personnel in the proposed Merger and ordinary course concerns regarding employee
retention during the pendency of the proposed Merger, including that Infinity’s existing arrangements did not sufficiently address this scenario from the
perspective of Kemper’s senior management.

Later on February 7, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered an initial draft of the Infinity voting agreement to KMK. The draft
Infinity voting agreement, which was contemplated by the parties to be requested to be entered into by each of Infinity’s directors and currently
employed named executive officers, provided for each of Infinity’s directors and currently employed named executive officers to vote his or her Infinity
common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby and not otherwise oppose
the proposed Merger in his or her capacity as an Infinity shareholder, along with certain transfer restrictions on Infinity common stock and other terms.
The parties agreed that Kemper’s directors and currently employed named executive officers would be requested to enter into Kemper voting
agreements reflecting substantially similar obligations as those set forth in the Infinity voting agreement.

On February 8, 2018, the Infinity Board held a telephonic special meeting with senior management of Infinity, representatives of Deutsche Bank
and KMK to discuss Infinity’s reverse due diligence of Kemper, to provide a status update on the draft Merger Agreement negotiations and for
representatives of Deutsche Bank to discuss with the Infinity Board the financial terms and provisions of the draft Merger Agreement. The Infinity
Board asked questions and received answers from the others attending the telephonic meeting and discussed the reasons that entering into the proposed
Merger with Kemper were in the best interests of Infinity and Infinity shareholders, including the value of the proposed consideration to be received by
Infinity shareholders in the proposed Merger.

Later on February 8, 2018, KMK, on behalf of Infinity, delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley Austin. Such revised draft
largely reflected the terms agreed upon by the parties during their discussion by telephone on February 7, 2018, while also providing for a termination
fee equal to 3.00% of the total equity value of the proposed Merger, a covenant regarding the addition of one member of the Infinity Board to the
Kemper Board after the closing of the proposed Merger, which member would be chosen by Kemper subject to the Kemper Board’s policies and
applicable rules and regulations, and the removal of the closing condition with respect to Infinity’s tangible net worth. In addition, such revised draft
expressly reserved any revisions with respect to the Infinity employee retention matters and the treatment of Infinity’s outstanding equity awards
pending further discussion between the parties.

Between the January 19, 2018 initial draft of the Merger Agreement through the February 8, 2018 draft of the Merger Agreement, Infinity’s senior
management and Deutsche Bank kept Mr. Weinhoff informed of negotiations of the various drafts of the Merger Agreement and Mr. Weinhoff kept the
Term Sheet Committee informed and relayed the Term Sheet Committee’s thoughts to Infinity’s senior management and Deutsche Bank.

Also on February 8, 2018, members of Kemper’s management delivered initial drafts of forms of the retention agreements between Infinity and
certain members of Infinity’s management (not including Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman or Mr. Simon) to members of Infinity’s senior management. On
February 9, 2018, members of Kemper’s management delivered initial drafts of retention agreements between Kemper and Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman
and Mr. Simon to members of Infinity’s senior management.

Over the course of February 9, 2018, members of each of Infinity’s senior management and Kemper’s senior management and representatives of
each of KMK and Sidley Austin held respective discussions by telephone concerning, and reached tentative agreement regarding, a termination fee
equal to 3.50% of the total equity value of the proposed Merger (or $49,598,810), certain Infinity employee retention matters in the draft Merger
Agreement, the treatment of Infinity’s outstanding equity awards and the forms of the retention

agreements between Infinity and certain members of Infinity’s management (not including Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman or Mr. Simon). Several of the
other remaining open issues in the draft Merger Agreement and the retention agreements between Kemper and Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and
Mr. Simon were also discussed between the parties.

Also on February 9, 2018, each of KMK, on behalf of Infinity, and Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered a revised draft of the Infinity
voting agreement to the other party, in each case reflecting limited changes. The latter of these drafts of the Infinity voting agreement reflected
substantial agreement on all material terms.

Additionally, on February 9, 2018 and continuing on February 12, 2018, members of Kemper’s management held discussions with certain rating
agencies regarding the potential effects of the proposed Merger on the combined company’s credit rating.

Later on February 9, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered an initial draft of the Kemper voting agreement to KMK. The draft
Kemper voting agreement, which was contemplated by the parties to be requested to be entered into by each of Kemper’s directors and currently
employed named executive officers, provided for each of Kemper’s directors and currently employed named executive officers to vote his or her
Kemper common stock in favor of the approval of the stock issuance in the proposed Merger and not otherwise oppose the approval of the stock
issuance in the proposed Merger in his or her capacity as a Kemper stockholder, along with certain transfer restrictions on Kemper common stock and
other terms. This draft Kemper voting agreement reflected substantially similar obligations as those set forth in the draft Infinity voting agreement and
accordingly reflected substantial agreement on all material terms.

Early in the morning on February 10, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to KMK. Such
revised draft reflected the terms tentatively agreed upon by the parties during their calls over the course of the previous day.

Later in the morning on February 10, 2018, representatives of KMK and Sidley Austin held a discussion by telephone to further negotiate the
remaining open issues in the draft Merger Agreement. Shortly thereafter on February 10, 2018, KMK, on behalf of Infinity, delivered a revised draft of
the Merger Agreement to Sidley Austin. Such revised draft reflected substantial acceptance of the revisions proposed by Kemper in its previous draft,
with the exception of the scope of certain aspects of the closing condition with respect to Infinity employee retention matters and the removal of the
closing condition with respect to Infinity’s tangible net worth.

On February 10, 2018, Infinity’s revised draft of the Merger Agreement, along with a summary of the terms and conditions of the draft Merger
Agreement reflecting discussions between the parties since the delivery of such draft, were provided by KMK to the Infinity Board. The Infinity Board
reviewed the draft Merger Agreement and the summary.

In the evening on February 10, 2018 and in the afternoon on February 11, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, and KMK, on behalf of
Infinity, respectively, delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to the other party’s legal advisor, neither of which included a closing condition
with respect to Infinity’s tangible net worth. Over the course of February 10 and 11, 2018, KMK and Sidley Austin continued to hold discussions by
telephone to further negotiate the scope of certain aspects of the closing condition with respect to Infinity employee retention matters.

Also over the course of February 10 and 11, 2018, members of Kemper’s senior management and Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Simon
negotiated and tentatively agreed on the remaining open issues in the retention agreements between Kemper and Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman and
Mr. Simon.

Infinity’s senior management kept Mr. Weinhoff informed of negotiations of the various drafts of the Merger Agreement circulated between

senior management.

In the evening on February 11, 2018, the Infinity Board, Infinity’s senior management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met for dinner and
discussed various aspects of the proposed Merger.

On February 12, 2018, the Infinity Board held an in-person special meeting in Birmingham, Alabama which was attended by members of
Infinity’s senior management, representatives of KMK, representatives of Deutsche Bank and, telephonically at the request of the Infinity Board and
solely for the portion of the meeting described below, Mr. Lacher and Mr. Green. The Executive Committee of the Infinity Board met initially to
approve the compensation of the Term Sheet Committee and to approve independent director compensation. Prior to the meeting, the Infinity Board was
provided with a summary that described the terms of the draft Merger Agreement based on the draft previously circulated by KMK on behalf of Infinity
on February 10, 2018. Representatives of KMK reviewed the material terms of the proposed Merger and described the provisions of the draft Merger
Agreement including the various closing conditions. KMK discussed with the Infinity Board the legal framework for the Infinity Board’s consideration
of the proposed Merger, including the fiduciary duties applicable to the directors of Infinity and related matters. The members of the Infinity Board
asked questions and discussed various provisions of the draft Merger Agreement. Representatives of Deutsche Bank provided an overview of the
material financial terms of the draft Merger Agreement, including the proposed consideration, reviewed Deutsche Bank’s financial analysis relating to
the Merger Consideration, as more fully described below under the heading “The Merger—Opinion of Infinity’s Financial Advisor,” and rendered to the
Infinity Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 13, 2018, to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the Merger
Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Infinity common stock (excluding Kemper and its affiliates). Mr. Lacher and
Mr. Green were introduced and presented to the Infinity Board their views of the proposed Merger and the potential benefits that may be realized by
shareholders of Infinity and stockholders of Kemper from the perspective of Kemper’s senior management.

Following the meeting of the Infinity Board, Mr. Lacher and Mr. Weinhoff further discussed and reaffirmed the parties’ tentative agreement
regarding the provision in the draft Merger Agreement with respect to the addition of one member of the Infinity Board to the Kemper Board after the
closing of the proposed Merger, which member would be chosen by Kemper subject to the Kemper Board’s policies and applicable rules and
regulations.

Also on February 12, 2018, the Kemper Board held a telephonic special meeting to discuss the proposed Merger and the draft Merger Agreement
and recent related developments, attended also by members of Kemper’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives
of Sidley Austin. At the meeting, Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board with an update of the status of developments and discussions regarding the
proposed Merger since the meeting of the Kemper Board on February 7, 2018, including negotiations between the parties with respect to the remaining
open issues in the draft Merger Agreement and Mr. Lacher’s and Mr. Green’s aforementioned discussion with the Infinity Board, and proposed next
steps and timing. Mr. Lacher also summarized for the Kemper Board the key terms of the retention agreements between Kemper and Mr. Godwin,
Mr. Bateman and Mr. Simon and the Kemper Board indicated its support of such arrangements. Mr. McKinney then reviewed with the Kemper Board
the results of the due diligence review of Infinity conducted by Kemper’s management and advisors. At the request of the Kemper Board,
representatives of Sidley Austin then again reviewed with the Kemper Board the fiduciary duties of the directors in considering the proposed Merger.
Representatives of Sidley Austin also reviewed with the Kemper Board a summary of key non-price provisions of the draft Merger Agreement and draft
voting agreements. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Kemper Board Goldman Sachs’ preliminary financial analysis relating to
the proposed Merger Consideration. The Kemper Board then discussed, with the input of Kemper’s senior management and representatives from
Goldman Sachs and Sidley Austin, a number of considerations related to the proposed Merger and the assessment thereof provided by Kemper’s senior
management. In an executive session of the non-employee directors following such discussion, the non-employee directors discussed, with the input of
representatives from Goldman Sachs and Sidley Austin, additional considerations related to the proposed

Merger. Following further discussion, the Kemper Board indicated its support of, and instructed Kemper’s senior management to work towards,
finalizing the forms of the transaction documents with Infinity for its consideration.

Over the course of February 12, 2018, members of each of Infinity’s senior management and Kemper’s senior management and representatives of
each of KMK and Sidley Austin negotiated and tentatively agreed on the remaining open issues in the draft Merger Agreement. Throughout this process,
Infinity’s senior management and Deutsche Bank kept Mr. Weinhoff informed of such remaining open issues and Mr. Weinhoff kept the Term Sheet
Committee informed and relayed the Term Sheet Committee’s thoughts to Infinity’s senior management and Deutsche Bank.

In the early hours of February 13, 2018, Sidley Austin, on behalf of Kemper, delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to KMK reflecting
substantial agreement on all material terms. Later in the morning on February 13, 2018, members of Infinity’s senior management and representatives of
KMK and members of Kemper’s senior management and representatives of Sidley Austin held respective discussions by telephone during which
Infinity gauged Kemper’s willingness to negotiate an increase in the number of Infinity Board members that would serve on the Kemper Board after the
closing of the proposed Merger, but which number remained at one after confirmation by the parties.

On February 13, 2018, the Infinity Board held a telephonic special meeting to discuss various matters related to the proposed Merger, including
the number of Infinity directors that would serve on the Kemper Board following the proposed Merger. After discussion and the recommendation by
Infinity’s management that the Infinity Board approve the Merger Agreement, and in light of the Infinity Board’s review and consideration of the factors
described under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Infinity Board and Its Reasons for the Merger,” the Infinity Board unanimously determined that
the proposed Merger and the Merger Agreement were consistent with, and would further, Infinity’s business strategies and goals and approved the
proposed Merger and Merger Agreement. The Infinity Board also unanimously determined that the proposed Merger and Merger Agreement were in the
best interests of Infinity and Infinity’s shareholders and unanimously recommended that Infinity shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

Also on February 13, 2018, the Kemper Board held a telephonic special meeting to consider the proposed Merger and the Merger Agreement,
attended also by members of Kemper’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Sidley Austin. At the meeting,
Mr. Lacher provided the Kemper Board with an update of the status of discussions regarding the proposed Merger since the meeting of the Kemper
Board on February 12, 2018. Mr. McKinney then again provided an overview of the consideration proposed to be paid by Kemper in the proposed
Merger. Mr. McKinney also provided the Kemper Board with an update of other developments regarding the proposed Merger. At the request of the
Kemper Board, representatives of Sidley Austin then reviewed with the Kemper Board the status of negotiations between the parties with respect to any
remaining open issues in the Merger Agreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Kemper Board Goldman Sachs’ financial
analysis summarized in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Kemper’s Financial Advisor” and delivered the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs,
subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated February 13, 2018, to the Kemper Board that, as of February 13, 2018, and based on
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such written opinion, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid by Kemper for all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to Kemper.
Following discussion of considerations related to the proposed Merger, members of Kemper’s senior management then indicated that it was the
recommendation of Kemper’s management that the Kemper Board approve the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby. Following discussion, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions approving the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby and resolved to recommend that the Kemper stockholders vote “FOR” the share issuance proposal and “FOR” the
approval of the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal.

In connection with such approvals by the Infinity Board and the Kemper Board, which occurred after the closing of trading on the U.S. stock
markets for the day, Infinity’s senior management and representatives of KMK worked with Kemper’s senior management and representatives of Sidley
Austin to finalize the Merger Agreement on the terms approved by the Infinity Board and the Kemper Board.

Later on February 13, 2018, each of Infinity and Kemper and their respective directors and currently employed named executive officers executed
and delivered their respective voting agreements. In addition, each of Mr. Godwin, Mr. Bateman, Mr. Simon and certain other members of Infinity’s
management, on the one hand, and Kemper and Infinity, as applicable, on the other hand, executed and delivered each of such Infinity employees’
retention agreements.

Each of Infinity, Kemper and Merger Sub then executed and delivered the Merger Agreement.

Shortly thereafter on February 13, 2018, Infinity and Kemper issued a joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement.

Recommendation of the Kemper Board and Its Reasons for the Merger

After careful consideration, on February 13, 2018, the Kemper Board unanimously adopted resolutions approving the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the share issuance, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that Kemper stockholders vote “FOR” the share
issuance proposal and “FOR” the Kemper meeting adjournment proposal at the Kemper annual meeting.

In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and recommend the
approval of the share issuance proposal, the Kemper Board consulted with the members of Kemper’s senior management, as well as Kemper’s financial
and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

Strategic Considerations. The Kemper Board considered that the Merger is expected to provide a number of significant strategic opportunities,
including the following:
 

 
•  the view that the Merger would lead to increased scale and diversification in non-standard auto insurance, including a more diversified

portfolio with approximately $2.2 billion in non-standard auto insurance premiums, an expanded customer reach through deeper agency
relationships and greater efficiencies;

 

 
•  the view that the combined company would have further access to growing segments through an expanded product offering and broader

customer base, while at the same time offering a more targeted yet better diversified suite of products across life, health, auto and
homeowner insurance, providing customers with greater choice at more competitive prices;

 

 
•  the view that the combined company would have the ability to leverage unique operational strengths, platforms and demographic insights to

drive enhanced growth and provide a unique set of products to its policyholders;
 

 
•  the view that the Merger would further Kemper’s corporate strategy by enhancing near and long-term stockholder value through strategic

acquisitions;
 

 •  the view that the combined company would have an increased ability to attract and retain key employees;

Table of Contents

 
•  the experience with respect to non-standard automobile insurance of Infinity’s management and operational teams and the complimentary

cultures of Kemper and Infinity; and
 

 •  the view that the combined company would have improved data and analytical capabilities.

Financial Considerations. The Kemper Board considered that the Merger is expected to provide a number of significant financial opportunities
for Kemper stockholders and the combined company, including the following:
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger would be accretive to Kemper’s EPS in 2019, excluding VOBA and one-time items, and was expected to be

accretive to Kemper’s EPS in 2020 by more than 10%, excluding restructuring and one-time items;
 

 

•  the mix of cash and stock consideration, the fixed exchange ratio for the stock component of the Merger Consideration and the fact that
because of the fixed exchange ratio (i.e., it will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the market price of Kemper common stock or Infinity
common stock), Kemper would have certainty as to the number of shares of Kemper common stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger, while noting that the value of Kemper common stock to be paid to Infinity shareholders upon the closing could be significantly
more or less than its implied value prior to the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement as a result of any difference in the
market price of Kemper common stock between prior to or at the time of announcement and the closing;

 

 
•  the course of negotiations between the parties in arriving at the amount and mix of consideration to be paid in the Merger, while taking note

of the historic and current market prices of Kemper common stock and Infinity common stock;
 

 
•  the expectation that the Merger would be accretive to return on average common equity by more than 30 basis points and accretive to return

on average tangible common equity by more than 400 basis points in 2020;
 

 
•  the view that the combined company would have increased revenue and enhanced cash flow, which would be expected to increase financial

stability and provide additional resources to accelerate investments in growth; and
 

 
•  the expectation of annual pre-tax cost savings of approximately $55 million, and an additional $5 to $10 million of pre-tax earnings resulting

from the repositioning of Infinity’s investment portfolio, through 2020 achieved through the consolidation of redundant corporate functions
and the optimization of the combined company’s systems, business processes and reinsurance programs.

Other Factors Considered by the Kemper Board. In addition to considering the strategic and financial opportunities described above, the Kemper
Board considered the following additional factors, which it viewed as supporting and informing its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and recommend the approval of the share issuance proposal:
 

 

•  taking into account the report the Kemper Board had received regarding past fees received by Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division
for services provided to Kemper and Infinity, and fees payable to Goldman Sachs in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the financial analyses presented to the Kemper Board by Goldman Sachs and the oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
in writing, of Goldman Sachs delivered to the Kemper Board that, as of February 13, 2018 and based on and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid by Kemper for all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to Kemper. See
“The Merger—Opinion of Kemper’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 146;

 

 
•  the scope of the due diligence investigation conducted by Kemper’s management, financial advisor, legal counsel and other outside

consultants and the substantive results thereof, including various oral

and written reports provided to the Kemper Board and the fact that the due diligence investigations set the stage for pre-closing integration
and transition planning and post-closing implementation;

 

 •  the general terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related documentation, including:
 

 •  the customary nature of the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants;
 

 •  the generally reciprocal deal protection provisions, including:
 

 

◾  the ability to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a Kemper superior proposal (as described on page 196 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus), so long as Kemper has complied with its obligations with respect to not soliciting Kemper
acquisition proposals (as described on page 196 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) in all material respects and enters
into such definitive agreement concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement and pays a termination fee of
$49,598,810;

 

 
◾  the amount of the termination fee (as described on page 218 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) and the view that it

would not prevent a potentially interested party from making a Kemper competing proposal (as described on page 196 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus); and

 

 

◾  the fact the Kemper Board may, solely in response to a Kemper superior proposal received on or after the date of the Merger
Agreement that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, make a
Kemper adverse recommendation change (as described on page 196 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) in order to cause
Kemper to terminate the Merger Agreement and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Kemper
superior proposal if Kemper has taken certain actions and the Kemper Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
Kemper’s outside legal counsel) that such Kemper acquisition proposal continues to constitute a Kemper superior proposal;

 

 

•  the provisions related to regulatory approvals and clearances, including that each party is obligated to use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, but that none of Kemper or any of its subsidiaries will be
obligated to, and neither Infinity nor any of its subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of Kemper, consent to, take or
refrain from taking, or offer or commit or consent to take or refrain from taking any action that involves a materially burdensome
condition (See “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Complete the Merger” beginning on page 201); and

 

 
•  the entry by the directors and certain of the executive officers of each of Kemper and Infinity into the Kemper Voting and Support

Agreements and Infinity Voting and Support Agreements, respectively;
 

 •  the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated and the anticipated timing of closing based on, among other things:
 

 
•  the scope of the conditions precedent to the closing generally, including regulatory approvals and the Infinity shareholder approval

(as described on page 190 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) and the Kemper stockholder approval (as described on page 190
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus);

 

 •  the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the possibility that a third party would make an offer to acquire or otherwise enter into an extraordinary transaction with Infinity or

Kemper; and
 

 
•  the likelihood that the Merger, the issuance of shares of Kemper common stock to Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger

Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the

Merger Agreement would be completed on a timely basis, including the likelihood that the Merger would receive all necessary
regulatory clearances and approvals without the imposition of materially burdensome conditions or otherwise unacceptable
conditions; and

 

 
•  Kemper management’s recommendation in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

contemplated thereby.

The Kemper Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  the need to retain and recruit talented employees, a key strategic benefit and driver of anticipated cost synergies, but that the Merger

Agreement contains conditions precedent to Kemper’s obligation to close the Merger related thereto and the retention agreements entered
into with certain members of Infinity’s management contain obligations related thereto;

 

 
•  the fact that upon the closing, current Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders are expected to own approximately 80% and 20%,

respectively, of the combined company based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock and other equity securities of Kemper
and Infinity on the date of the Merger Agreement;

 

 
•  the potential risk of not capturing all the anticipated cost savings and synergies between Infinity and Kemper and the risk that other

anticipated benefits of the Merger might not be realized or not realized in the expected timeframe;
 

 
•  the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the share issuance and

the substantial time and effort of Kemper management required to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which
may disrupt Kemper’s business operations;

 

 

•  the rights of Infinity shareholders to demand appraisal of their shares of Infinity common stock in connection with the Merger and the
potential effect of such demands to increase the cash paid by Kemper, but that the Merger Agreement contains a condition precedent to
Kemper’s obligation to close the Merger that Infinity shareholders holding not more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Infinity common
stock have demanded appraisal rights;

 

 
•  risks related to Infinity’s business, as described in the risk factors discussion in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Infinity” beginning on

page 45; and
 

 
•  the other risks described under the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements”

beginning on pages 38 and 1, respectively.

The Kemper Board determined that, overall, these potential risks and uncertainties were outweighed by the benefits that the Kemper Board
expects to achieve for Kemper stockholders as a result of the Merger. The Kemper Board was aware that there can be no assurance about future results,
including results considered or expected as disclosed in the foregoing reasons.

This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Kemper Board includes material factors considered by the Kemper Board, but it
is not intended to be exhaustive and may not include all factors considered by the Kemper Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered, and
the complexity of these matters, the Kemper Board did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors that it considered in
reaching its determination to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the
Merger. Rather, the Kemper Board viewed its position and recommendation as being based on the totality of the information presented to and factors
considered by it, including discussions with, and questioning of, Kemper’s management and its financial and legal advisors. In

addition, individual members of the Kemper Board may have given differing weights to different factors. It should be noted that this explanation of the
reasoning of the Kemper Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, that information should be
read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

The Kemper Board unanimously recommends that Kemper stockholders vote “FOR” the share issuance proposal and “FOR” the
Kemper meeting adjournment proposal at the Kemper annual meeting.

Recommendation of the Infinity Board and Its Reasons for the Merger

After consideration, the Infinity Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Infinity and its shareholders, and approved and adopted the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. The Infinity Board unanimously recommends that
Infinity shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and recommend the
approval of the merger proposal, the Infinity Board consulted with the members of Infinity’s senior management, as well as Infinity’s financial and legal
advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

Strategic Considerations. The Infinity Board considered that the Merger is expected to provide a number of significant strategic opportunities,
including the following:
 

 

•  the potential for Infinity’s shareholders, as future Kemper stockholders, to benefit to the extent of their interest in the combined company
from the synergies of the Merger and the anticipated pro forma impact of the Merger, and the expectation that the Merger will be accretive to
Kemper’s earnings per share on an adjusted basis in the first full fiscal year following the Merger and accretive to earnings per share on an
adjusted basis on a double-digit basis within two years after the closing;

 

 
•  the view that the shared strategies of Infinity and Kemper would assist in integration and operating the combined company post-closing to

the benefit of Infinity shareholders as future Kemper stockholders;
 

 
•  the view that the combined company will create a leader in non-standard automobile insurance, with enhanced growth and a more

diversified product mix providing for greater choices for customers at more competitive prices, which factors are expected to significantly
enhance policyholder retention;

 

 
•  the view that the combined company may be considered a growth company with complementary operational strengths, platforms, analytical

capabilities and demographic insights driving new growth opportunities;
 

 •  the belief that the scale of operations of the combined company will benefit shareholders by increasing profit margins; and
 

 
•  the belief that the Merger would accelerate the accomplishment of several key elements of Infinity’s strategic plan and strengthen Infinity’s

value proposition and reduce the risk of pursuing Infinity’s strategic plan by drawing upon the combined company’s competencies and
resources.

Other Factors Considered by the Infinity Board. In addition to considering the strategic opportunities described above, the Infinity Board
considered the following additional factors, most of which it viewed as supporting and informing its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and recommend the approval of the merger proposal:
 

 
•  the fact that the value of the per share Cash Consideration of $129.00 represented an approximately 33 percent (33%) premium to the

closing price of Infinity common stock of $97.05 on February 12, 2018;

Table of Contents

 
•  the fact that the per share Mixed Consideration had an implied value of $121.01 based on the closing price of Kemper common stock of

$57.75 on February 12, 2018, representing an approximately 25 percent (25%) premium to the closing price of Infinity common stock of
$97.05 on February 12, 2018;

 

 
•  the fact that the cash component of the Merger Consideration offers Infinity shareholders the opportunity to realize immediate cash valued at

more than 50 percent (50%) of the February 12, 2018 closing price of Infinity common stock;
 

 
•  the fact that the stock component of the Merger Consideration offers Infinity shareholders the opportunity to participate in the future growth

and opportunities of the combined company;
 

 

•  the financial presentation of Infinity’s financial advisor, Deutsche Bank, to the Infinity Board on February 12, 2018, and the oral opinion of
Deutsche Bank delivered to the Infinity Board on February 12, 2018, subsequently confirmed in writing on February 13, 2018, to the effect
that as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in
Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Infinity common stock (excluding
Kemper and its affiliates), as further described in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Infinity’s Financial Advisor” beginning on
page 156;

 

 
•  the results of the due diligence review of Kemper’s businesses and operations, including the information and discussions regarding

Kemper’s business, results of operations, financial and market positions and future earnings and prospects;
 

 •  the historical and then-current trading prices and volumes of each of Infinity common stock and Kemper common stock;
 

 
•  the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the Merger, and the expectation that such approvals could be received in a

reasonably timely manner;
 

 

•  the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the course of negotiations of the Merger Agreement, including, among other things,
the per share Merger Consideration (see “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration” and “The Merger—Background of the Merger”
beginning on pages 178 and 122, respectively), the cash and stock mix and the exchange ratio, the ability of the Infinity Board, under certain
circumstances to change the Infinity recommendation (see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning
on page 188), the conditions to the closing (see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger”), the ability of Infinity
to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances (see “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”
(beginning on page 216) and that Infinity’s shareholders will have an opportunity to vote on the Merger and that their approval is a condition
to the closing (see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger”);

 

 •  the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated and the anticipated timing of closing based on, among other things:
 

 •  the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  the scope of the conditions to the closing; and
 

 •  the level of commitment by both companies to obtain applicable regulatory approvals.
 

 
•  the fact that the combined company will continue to use the Infinity brand (see “The Merger Agreement—Structure and Completion of the

Merger” beginning on page 178);
 

 
•  the fact that Infinity’s headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama will house a substantial portion of the combined company’s non-standard

automobile insurance operations for the foreseeable future;
 

 
•  the Infinity Board’s familiarity with and understanding of Infinity’s business, results of operations, financial and market position and its

expectations concerning Infinity’s future earnings and prospects; and

•  the Infinity Board’s familiarity with and understanding of the industry and the current and prospective environment in which each of Infinity

and Kemper operate, including national and local economic conditions, the competitive and regulatory environments for insurance
companies generally and the likely effect of these factors on Infinity both with and without the Merger.

The Infinity Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  the risk that the Merger may not be consummated or that the closing may be unduly delayed, including as a result of factors outside of either

party’s control;
 

 
•  the challenges inherent in the Merger of two businesses of the size, geographical diversity and scope of Infinity and Kemper and the size of

the companies relative to each other, including the risk that integration costs may be greater than anticipated and the possible diversion of
management attention for an extended period;

 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Infinity’s business to the Merger, and the possibility

of employee attrition or adverse effects on client and business relationships as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Merger;
 

 
•  the potential risk that Infinity shareholders or Kemper stockholders may object to and challenge the Merger and take actions that may

prevent or delay the closing, including to vote against proposals at the Infinity special meeting or Kemper annual meeting;
 

 
•  the potential risk associated with Infinity shareholders not having proportional representation on the Kemper Board, as, following the

closing, Infinity shareholders will own approximately 20 percent of the outstanding common stock of Kemper, but only one Infinity director
will become a member of the Kemper Board;

 

 
•  the potential risk of not capturing all the anticipated cost savings and synergies between Infinity and Kemper and the risk that other

anticipated benefits of the Merger might not be realized or not realized in the expected timeframe;
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger is taxable to Infinity shareholders as described under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax

Consequences” beginning on page 166;
 

 
•  the terms of the Merger Agreement that restrict Infinity’s ability to solicit alternative transactions, as discussed under “The Merger

Agreement—Infinity Acquisition Proposals” beginning on page 191;
 

 
•  the requirement that Infinity pay Kemper a termination fee of $49,598,810 and reimburse Kemper for its expenses incurred in connection

with the Merger in an aggregate amount not to exceed $14,171,089 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances;
 

 
•  the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of Infinity’s business during the period between execution of the Merger Agreement

and the closing;
 

 •  the potential risks and costs associated with successfully integrating Infinity’s business, operations and workforce with those of Kemper; and
 

 
•  the other risks described under the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements”

beginning on pages 38 and 1, respectively.

The Infinity Board determined that overall these potential risks and uncertainties were outweighed by the benefits that the Infinity Board expects
to achieve for Infinity shareholders as a result of the Merger. The Infinity Board was aware that there can be no assurance about future results, including
results considered or expected as disclosed in the foregoing reasons.

In considering the recommendation of the Infinity Board, Infinity shareholders should be aware that certain directors and officers of Infinity may
have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, interests of shareholders of Infinity generally and may create potential conflicts of
interest. The Infinity Board was aware of these interests and considered them when evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and in recommending to Infinity’s shareholders that they vote in favor of the merger
proposal. See “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Infinity Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, that information should be read in light of
the factors discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

After consideration and evaluation of the Merger in consultation with Infinity management and advisors, the Infinity Board unanimously
determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interest
of the Infinity shareholders and unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

For the reasons set forth above, the Infinity Board unanimously recommends that the Infinity shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

Opinion of Kemper’s Financial Advisor

At a meeting of the Kemper Board held on February 13, 2018, Goldman Sachs delivered to the Kemper Board its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that, as of February 13, 2018 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written
opinion, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid by Kemper for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Kemper.

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Kemper and Infinity, regarding their assessment of the past and
current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Infinity and with the members of the senior management of Kemper regarding
their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Kemper and the strategic rationale for, and the
potential benefits of, the proposed Merger; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Kemper common stock and the shares of
Infinity common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Kemper and Infinity with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the property and casualty
insurance industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Kemper Board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and

(including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Kemper or Infinity or any of their respective subsidiaries and
Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs is not an actuary and its services did not include any actuarial
determination or evaluation by Goldman Sachs or any attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions and Goldman Sachs relied on Kemper’s actuaries with
respect to reserve adequacy. In that regard, Goldman Sachs made no analysis of, and expressed no opinion as to, the adequacy of the loss and loss
adjustments expenses reserves or the future policy benefit reserves of Kemper or the adequacy of the loss and loss adjustments expenses reserves of
Infinity. Goldman Sachs assumed that all

Analysis of Implied Premiums and Multiples

Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain premiums and multiples using the closing price for shares of Kemper common stock on
February 12, 2018, the last completed trading day before Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to the Kemper Board, and the implied value of the price
to be paid by Kemper for each share of issued and outstanding Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement based on the Mixed
Consideration of 1.2019 shares of Kemper common stock and $51.60 in cash.

Goldman Sachs calculated the implied value of the Merger Consideration as equal to $121.01 per share of Infinity common stock by adding
(a) the product of $57.75, the closing price of shares of Kemper common stock on February 12, 2018, multiplied by 1.2019 shares of Kemper common
stock (such product deriving an implied value of the stock portion of the Mixed Consideration of $69.41) plus (b) $51.60, the cash portion of the Mixed
Consideration. Goldman Sachs calculated the implied value of the aggregate Merger Consideration as equal to $1.329 billion by multiplying $121.01 by
the total number of fully diluted shares of Infinity common stock outstanding as of February 6, 2018, as provided by Infinity management.

Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the following:
 

 
•  the implied premiums represented by the implied value of the Merger Consideration of $121.01 per share of Infinity common stock relative

to
 

 •  $97.05, the closing price for shares of Infinity common stock on February 12, 2018,
 

 
•  $103.25, the closing price for shares of Infinity common stock on January 10, 2018, the date on which Kemper and Infinity entered

into an exclusivity agreement in connection with the potential Merger,
 

 
•  $102.27, the volume-weighted average trading price (“VWAP”) of shares of Infinity common stock over the 30-trading day time

period ended February 12, 2018,
 

 •  $104.79, the VWAP of shares of Infinity common stock over the 60-trading day time period ended February 12, 2018,
 

 •  $103.16, the VWAP of shares of Infinity common stock over the 90-trading day time period ended February 12, 2018,
 

 •  $108.85, the highest trading price of shares of Infinity common stock over the 52-week period ended February 12, 2018, and
 

 •  $83.55, the lowest trading price of shares of Infinity common stock over the 52-week period ended February 12, 2018;
 

 

•  the implied value of the aggregate Merger Consideration of $1.329 billion (based on the implied value of the Mixed Consideration of
$121.01 per share of Infinity common stock) as a multiple of the book value (“BV”) and tangible book value (“TBV”) of Infinity, in each
case as of December 31, 2017, both including and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) calculated based on
information provided in the Infinity financial projections and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Kemper; and

 

 

•  the $121.01 implied value of the merger consideration per Infinity share as a multiple of the estimated earnings per share (“EPS”) for
calendar years 2018 and 2019 for Infinity, calculated using the EPS estimates for Infinity for such years, both with and without Operating
Synergies, as reflected in the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (without synergies) and the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial
projections (with synergies), and using the median EPS estimates for Infinity for such years published by the Institutional Broker Estimate
System (“IBES”) as of February 12, 2018.

All trading prices of shares of Kemper common stock were as reported by the NYSE and all trading prices of Infinity common stock were as
reported by NASDAQ.

Illustrative Discounted Dividend Analyses for Infinity

Using the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (without synergies) and the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (with
synergies), Goldman Sachs performed illustrative discounted dividend analyses for Infinity, on a standalone basis, to derive a range of illustrative
present values per share of Infinity common stock, on a standalone basis, without and with Operating Synergies, respectively.

Without Synergies. Using a range of discount rates from 9.02% to 11.09%, reflecting estimates of Infinity’s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs derived
an illustrative equity value per share of Infinity common stock, on a standalone basis, excluding Synergies, by discounting to present value as of
December 31, 2017, (a) the estimated total available distributions to Infinity shareholders for the years 2018 through 2020, as reflected in the Kemper-
prepared Infinity financial projections (without synergies), and (b) a range of illustrative terminal values for Infinity, as of December 31, 2020,
calculated by applying exit terminal year price to book value (“P/BV”) multiples ranging from 1.61x to 1.86x to the estimate of the post-distribution
book value (including AOCI) of Infinity as of December 31, 2020, as reflected in the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (without synergies)
(which analysis implied 2021 price to earnings (“P/E”) multiples ranging from 15.5x to 17.9x). Goldman Sachs derived the range of discount rates by
application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally (the “CAPM”). The range of P/BV multiples used by Goldman Sachs reflected, on the
low-end, the P/BV multiple of 1.61x on the regression line (derived from the regression analysis performed based on the estimated 2018 return on equity
(“ROE”) and the P/BV multiples for the selected companies as described below) corresponding to the estimated ROE for Infinity without Synergies of

Table of Contents

10.1% for 2021, as reflected in the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (without synergies) and, on the high-end, a P/BV multiple of 1.86x,
reflecting a 15.6% premium to the regression line multiple (the same premium to the regression line multiple at which shares of Infinity common stock
traded based on IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018). Goldman Sachs then divided the ranges of illustrative equity values it derived for
Infinity on a standalone basis by the total number of fully diluted shares of Infinity common stock outstanding as of February 6, 2018, as provided by
Infinity management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Infinity common stock of $93.40 to $111.06.

With Operating Synergies. Goldman Sachs performed the same discounted dividend analysis described above for Infinity, on a standalone basis,
including Operating Synergies, using the same discount rates range of 9.02% to 11.09% used above but applying exit terminal year P/BV multiples
ranging from 3.00x to 3.47x (which reflected, on the low-end, the P/BV multiple of 3.00x on the regression line (derived from the regression analysis
performed based on the estimated 2018 ROE and the P/BV multiples for the selected companies as described below) corresponding to the estimated
ROE for Infinity, with Operating Synergies, of 20.3% for 2021, as reflected in the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (with synergies) and,
on the high-end, a P/BV multiple of 3.47x, reflecting a 15.6% premium to the regression line multiple (the same premium to the regression line multiple
at which shares of Infinity common stock traded based on IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018). In addition, using the same discount rate
range as specified above, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2017 (x) the Incremental Systems Conversions Synergies
estimated by management of Kemper to be realized in 2021 and (y) an illustrative terminal value for the Incremental Systems Conversions Synergies as
of December 31, 2021, calculated by applying an exit terminal year P/E multiple of 15.6x to the run-rate Incremental Systems Conversions Synergies
estimated by Kemper management to be first realized in full in 2022. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of Infinity
common stock of $159.64 to $189.18.

Illustrative Discounted Dividend Analyses for Kemper

Using the Kemper financial projections and the combined company financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed illustrative discounted
dividend analyses for Kemper, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Kemper common stock, on a standalone basis and on a
combined company basis, giving effect to the proposed Merger, respectively.

Kemper on a Standalone Basis

Using a range of discount rates of 11.77% to 13.84%, reflecting estimates of Kemper’s cost of equity on a standalone basis, derived by application
of the CAPM, Goldman Sachs derived an illustrative equity value per share of Kemper common stock, on a standalone basis, by discounting to present
value as of December 31, 2017, (a) the estimated total available distributions to Kemper stockholders for the years 2018 through 2020, as provided in
the Kemper financial projections and (b) a range of illustrative terminal values for Kemper, as of December 31, 2021, calculated by applying exit
terminal year P/BV multiples ranging from 1.65x to 1.88x to the estimate of the post-distributions book value (including AOCI) of Kemper as of
December 31, 2020, as reflected in the Kemper financial projections (which analysis implied exit 2021 P/E multiples ranging from 15.2x to 17.3x). The
range of P/BV multiples used by Goldman Sachs reflected, on the low-end, the P/BV multiple of 1.65x on the regression line (derived from the
regression analysis performed based on the estimated 2018 ROE and the P/BV multiples for the selected companies described below) corresponding to
the estimated ROE for Kemper of 10.4% for 2021, as reflected in the Kemper financial projections and, on the high-end, a P/BV multiple of 1.88x,
reflecting a 14.0% premium to the regression line multiple (the same premium to the regression line multiple at which shares of Kemper common stock
traded based on IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018). Goldman Sachs then divided these ranges of illustrative equity values it derived for
Kemper on a standalone basis by the total number of fully diluted shares of Kemper common stock outstanding as of February 9, 2018, as provided by
Kemper management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Kemper common stock of $58.73 to $70.32.

Kemper on a Combined Company Basis

Using a range of discount rates of 10.90% to 12.97%, reflecting estimates of Kemper’s cost of equity on a combined company basis, derived by
application of the CAPM, Goldman Sachs derived an illustrative equity value per share of Kemper common stock, on a combined company basis, by
discounting to present value as of December 31, 2017, (a) the estimated total available distributions to Kemper stockholders for the years 2018 through
2020, as provided in the combined company financial projections, (b) a range of illustrative terminal values for Kemper, as of December 31, 2020,
calculated by applying exit terminal year P/BV multiples ranging from 1.70x to 1.93x to the estimate of the post-distributions book value (including
AOCI) of Kemper as of December 31, 2020, as reflected in the combined company financial projections (which analysis implied 2021 P/E multiples
ranging from 15.1x to 17.2x), (c) estimates of the benefits to be derived by Kemper on a combined company basis from Operating Synergies in 2018
through 2020, as reflected in the combined company financial projections, and (d) (x) the Incremental Systems Conversions Synergies estimated by
management of Kemper to be realized in 2021 and (y) an illustrative terminal value for the Incremental Systems Conversions Synergies as of
December 31, 2021, calculated by applying an exit terminal year P/E multiple of 16.0x to the run-rate Incremental Systems Conversions Synergies
estimated by Kemper management to be first realized in full in 2022. The range of P/BV multiples used by Goldman Sachs reflected, on the low-end,
the P/BV multiple of 1.70x on the regression line (derived from the regression analysis performed based on the estimated 2018 ROE and the P/BV
multiples for the selected companies described below) corresponding to the estimated ROE for Kemper of 10.4% for 2021, as reflected in the combined
company financial projections and, on the high-end, a P/BV multiple of 1.93x reflecting a 14% premium to the regression line multiple (the same
premium to the regression line multiple at which shares of Kemper common stock traded based on IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018).
Goldman Sachs then divided these ranges of illustrative equity values it derived for Kemper on a combined company basis by the total number of fully
diluted shares of Kemper common stock expected to be outstanding after the proposed Merger, as provided by Kemper management, to derive a range
of illustrative present values per share of Kemper common stock of $67.87 to $81.18, which, compared to the range of illustrative present values per
share of Kemper common stock on a standalone basis derived based on the discounted dividend analysis for Kemper on a standalone basis described
above, implied an increase in equity value per share of Kemper common stock ranging from $9.14 to $10.86.

Illustrative Regression Analysis

Goldman Sachs performed a regression analysis using the P/BV per share multiples for Kemper, Infinity and the selected publicly traded
companies in the personal lines insurance industry listed below compared to the median estimates of 2018 ROE for Kemper, Infinity and the selected
companies published by IBES as of February 12, 2018 to derive a regression line reflecting a range of P/BV per share multiples at a range of estimated
2018 ROE for Kemper, Infinity and the selected companies. Goldman Sachs calculated the P/BV multiples for Kemper, Infinity and the selected
companies based on the closing prices per share for such companies and the respective book values per share for such companies based on information
reflected in the companies’ respective public filings and IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018. The names of the

Goldman Sachs applied to the regression line (i) the estimated 2019 and 2020 ROE for Kemper on a standalone basis and on a combined company
basis giving effect to the proposed Merger, as reflected in the Kemper financial projections and the combined company financial projections,
respectively, to derive corresponding P/BV multiples on the regression line and at a premium of 14% to the regression line (reflecting the premium to
the regression line at which shares of Kemper common stock traded based on IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018) and (ii) the estimated
2019 and 2020 ROE for Infinity on a standalone basis, without and with Operating Synergies, as reflected in the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial
projections (without synergies) and the Kemper-prepared Infinity financial projections (with synergies), respectively, to derive corresponding P/BV
multiples on the regression line and at a premium of 15.6% to the regression line (reflecting the premium to the regression line multiple at which shares
of Infinity common stock traded based on IBES median estimates as of February 12, 2018).

The 2019 ROE for Kemper on a standalone basis of 9.8% corresponded to P/BV per share multiples of 1.57x on the regression line and 1.79x at a
14% premium to the regression line. The 2020 ROE for Kemper on a standalone basis of 10.3% corresponded to P/BV per share multiples of 1.63x on
the regression line and 1.86x at a 14% premium to the regression line. Goldman Sachs applied these illustrative P/BV per share multiples to the book
value per share (including AOCI) of Kemper on a standalone basis as of December 31 of 2018 and 2019, respectively, as reflected in the Kemper
financial projections and discounted the results to present value as of December 31, 2017 using a discount rate of 12.81%, reflecting the midpoint
estimate of Kemper’s cost of equity on a standalone basis, derived by application of the CAPM, to derive illustrative values per share of Kemper
common stock on a standalone basis ranging from $59.63 to $68.28.

The 2019 ROE for Kemper on a combined company basis of 9.5% corresponded to P/BV per share multiples of 1.53x on the regression line and
1.74x at a 14% premium to the regression line. The 2020 ROE for Kemper on a combined company basis of 10.7% corresponded to P/BV per share
multiples of 1.69x on the regression line and 1.93x at a 14% premium to the regression line. Goldman Sachs applied these illustrative P/BV per share
multiples to the book value per share (including AOCI) of Kemper on a combined company basis as of December 31 of 2018 and 2019, respectively, as
reflected in the combined company financial projections and discounted the results to present value as of December 31, 2017 using a discount rate of
11.93%, reflecting the midpoint estimate of Kemper’s cost of equity on a combined company basis, derived by application of the CAPM, to derive
illustrative values per share of Kemper common stock on a combined company basis ranging from $63.86 to $76.60, which, compared to the range of
illustrative values per share of Kemper common stock derived based on the regression analysis for Kemper on a standalone basis described above,
implied an increase in equity value per share of Kemper common stock ranging from $4.23 to $8.32.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Stock Price Analyses for Kemper

Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future value per share of Kemper common stock on a
standalone basis and on a combined company basis giving effect to the proposed Merger.

Kemper on a Standalone Basis. Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share of Kemper common stock on a standalone
basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 by applying illustrative one year forward price to EPS multiples of 15.0x and 17.0x to the estimates of
Kemper’s EPS for the following fiscal year, based on Kemper’s EPS as reflected in the Kemper financial projections. Goldman Sachs derived such
multiples by adding or subtracting approximately 5% to or from, as applicable, Kemper’s one year forward price to EPS multiple of 16.0x based on the
IBES median 2018 EPS estimate for Kemper as of February 12, 2018 and the blended one year forward price to EPS multiple of Kemper and Infinity,
based on the combined company’s EPS as reflected in the combined company financial projections. By applying a discount rate of 12.81%, reflecting an
estimate of Kemper’s cost of equity on a standalone basis, derived by application of the CAPM, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of
December 31, 2017 both the range of theoretical future values per share it derived for Kemper on a standalone basis and the estimated dividends to be
paid per share of Kemper common stock on a standalone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the Kemper financial projections, to
yield illustrative present values per share of Kemper common stock on a standalone basis ranging from $59.34 to $68.26.

Kemper on a Combined Company Basis. Goldman Sachs also derived a range of theoretical future values per share of Kemper common stock on a
combined company basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 by applying illustrative one year forward price to EPS multiples of 15.0x and 17.0x
(derived as described above) to the estimates of Kemper’s EPS for the following fiscal year, as reflected in the combined company financial projections,
including the Operating Synergies. By applying a discount rate of 11.93%, reflecting an estimate of Kemper’s cost of equity on a combined company
basis, derived by application of the CAPM, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2017 both the range of theoretical future
values per share it derived for Kemper on a combined company basis and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of Kemper common stock on a
combined company basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the combined company financial projections, to yield illustrative present
values per share of Kemper common stock on a combined company basis ranging from $62.48 to $77.36, which, compared to the range of illustrative
values per share of Kemper common stock on a standalone basis derived based on the present value of future stock price analysis for Kemper on a
standalone basis described above, implied an increase in equity value per share of Kemper common stock ranging from $3.15 to $9.10.

General

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the
basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Kemper or Infinity or the proposed Merger.

Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Kemper Board that, as of February 13, 2018, the date of its
written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid by Kemper for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to Kemper. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect

the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon projections of future results are not necessarily indicative of
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject
to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Kemper, Goldman
Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted.

The aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid by Kemper for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Kemper and Infinity and was approved by the Kemper Board. Goldman
Sachs provided advice to Kemper during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to
Kemper or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed Merger.

As described in “The Merger—Recommendation of the Kemper Board and Its Reasons for the Merger,” Goldman Sachs’ opinion was one of
many factors taken into consideration by the Kemper Board in making its determination to approve the proposed Merger and recommend that the
Kemper stockholders approve the share issuance proposal. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the delivery of its fairness opinion to the Kemper Board and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any
time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments of Kemper, Infinity and any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the proposed Merger for the accounts of Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees and their customers. Goldman Sachs has acted as
financial advisor to Kemper in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the proposed Merger. Goldman Sachs has
provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Kemper and/or its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment
Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a joint book-running manager with respect to a public
offering of Kemper’s 4.350% Senior Notes due 2025 (aggregate principal amount $200,000,000) in June 2017. In addition, Goldman Sachs and Kemper
are discussing Goldman Sachs’ potential participation as a co-lender in any amendment to Kemper’s current unsecured, revolving credit agreement.
During the two-year period ended February 12, 2018, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services
provided by its Investment Banking Division to Kemper and/or its affiliates of approximately $325,000. During the two-year period ended February 12,
2018, Goldman Sachs did not recognize compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division
to Infinity and/or its affiliates. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Kemper, Infinity and
their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.

The Kemper Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has
substantial experience in transactions similar to the proposed Merger. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Kemper and Goldman Sachs, dated
February 11, 2018, Kemper engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger. The engagement letter
between Kemper and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of $13 million, all of which is contingent upon the closing. In addition, Kemper
agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including certain reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws arising out of Goldman
Sachs’ engagement on the terms set forth in the engagement letter.

Opinion of Infinity’s Financial Advisor

At the February 12, 2018 meeting of the Infinity Board, Deutsche Bank, financial advisor to Infinity, rendered its oral opinion to the Infinity
Board, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 13, 2018, to the effect that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject
to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Infinity common stock (excluding Kemper and its affiliates). Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion as to the
proration and election procedures in the Merger Agreement.

The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated February 13, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex
E and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A summary of Deutsche Bank’s opinion is set forth in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Infinity’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 156 and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was approved and authorized for issuance by a
Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Infinity Board in connection with
and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Merger. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was limited to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Infinity common stock (excluding Kemper and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion. The opinion
did not address any other terms of the Merger or the Merger Agreement. Nor did the opinion address the terms of any other agreement entered
into or to be entered into in connection with the Merger. The Infinity Board did not ask Deutsche Bank to, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did
not, address the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of Infinity, nor did it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Merger. Deutsche Bank’s opinion
did not address the allocation of the Merger Consideration among the holders of Infinity common stock who receive the Mixed Consideration,
the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by Infinity
to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor did
Deutsche Bank express an opinion, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of Infinity
common stock should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter, including whether any such holder should elect to receive the
Mixed Consideration, the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration. In addition, Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to
the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the officers, directors,
or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Merger whether relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not in any manner address the prices at which the Kemper common stock or the
Infinity common stock will trade at any time.

In connection with its role as a financial advisor to Infinity, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available
financial and other information concerning Infinity and Kemper; certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to Infinity
prepared by management of Infinity (including the Infinity financial projections described on page 269 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus); and
certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to Kemper and the combined company prepared by management of Kemper
and approved for Deutsche Bank’s use by Infinity (including the Kemper financial projections described on page 269 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus). Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers, other representatives and advisors of Infinity regarding the
business and prospects of Infinity and with certain senior officers, other representatives and advisors of Kemper regarding the business and prospects
Kemper and the combined company. In addition, Deutsche Bank:
 

 •  reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Infinity common stock and Kemper common stock;

•  compared certain financial and stock market information for Infinity and Kemper with, to the extent publicly available, similar information

for certain other companies it considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded;
 

 •  reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of recent business combinations which it deemed relevant;
 

 •  reviewed the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.

Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify any information, whether publicly
available or furnished to it, concerning Infinity or Kemper, including without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the
rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Infinity Board, assumed
and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or
assets, and did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of Infinity, Kemper or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the
solvency or fair value of Infinity, Kemper, or any of their respective subsidiaries (or the impact of the Merger thereon) under any law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the Infinity financial projections and Kemper financial projections made available to Deutsche
Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed with the knowledge and permission of the Infinity Board that such Infinity financial projections
and Kemper financial projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Infinity as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such
Infinity financial projections and Kemper financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was necessarily
based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Deutsche Bank
expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which it becomes
aware of after the date of its opinion.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Infinity Board, that in all respects
material to its analysis, the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or
amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank also assumed with the knowledge and permission
of the Infinity Board, that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the closing would be
obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or
conditions would be imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting expert and relied on the
assessments made by Infinity and its other advisors with respect to such issues.

Infinity selected Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on Deutsche Bank’s qualifications, expertise,
reputation, experience in mergers and acquisitions. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Infinity and Deutsche Bank, dated December 21, 2017,
Infinity has agreed to pay Deutsche Bank a transaction fee equal to 1% of the value of the aggregate consideration (as defined in the engagement letter),
which equaled approximately $13 million as of March 29, 2018, for its services as financial advisor to Infinity in connection with the Merger, of which
$1.0 million became payable upon the delivery of Deutsche Bank’s opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Infinity
Board that it was unable to render the opinion) and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Infinity also agreed to
reimburse Deutsche Bank for all reasonable documented fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and all of Deutsche Bank’s reasonable travel
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger or otherwise arising out of its engagement, in each case on the terms set forth
in its engagement

letter. Infinity has also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and its affiliates to the full extent lawful against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities
arising out of its engagement or the Merger on the terms set forth in its engagement letter.

Deutsche Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and
acquisitions and related transactions. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the “DB Group”). One or more
members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, investment banking, commercial banking (including extension of credit) and other
financial services to Kemper or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, compensation. Based upon a review of its
internal management information systems as of February 9, 2018, the DB Group had received less than €100,000 in fees for such services from Kemper
since January 1, 2015. The DB Group may also provide investment and commercial banking services to Kemper, Infinity, and their respective affiliates
in the future, for which Deutsche Bank would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of business, members of the DB
Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Kemper and Infinity and their respective affiliates for their own
accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities,
instruments and obligations.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Infinity Board at its meeting held on
February 12, 2018, and that were used in connection with rendering its opinion described above.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Deutsche Bank, nor does
the order in which the analyses are described represent the relative importance or weight given to the analyses by Deutsche Bank. Some of the
summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the analyses, the tables must be read

Infinity Material Financial Analyses

Selected Companies Analysis

Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for Infinity with corresponding
financial information and valuation measurements for the following four publicly traded companies, referred to in this section as the “Infinity selected
companies”:
 

 •  Kemper
 

 •  Mercury General Corporation
 

 •  National General Insurance Co.
 

 •  Safety Insurance Group, Inc.

Although none of the Infinity selected companies is directly comparable to Infinity, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly
traded companies with financial and operating characteristics that, for purpose of analysis, may be considered similar to certain financial or operating
characteristics of Infinity. Accordingly, the analysis of the Infinity selected companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it involved complex
considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the Infinity selected companies and other factors that could affect the public trading values of such companies.

Based on the closing prices of the common stock of the Infinity selected companies on February 9, 2018, information contained in the most recent
public filings of the Infinity selected companies and analyst consensus estimates of operating earnings per share for calendar years 2018 and 2019 for
the Infinity selected companies, Deutsche Bank calculated the following multiples for each of the Infinity selected companies:
 

 •  the ratio of stock price to tangible book value per share, referred to as “TBVPS”, as of September 30, 2017;
 

 •  the ratio of stock price to book value per share, referred to as “BVPS”, as of September 30, 2017;
 

 •  the ratio of stock price to estimated earnings per share (“EPS”) for calendar year 2018, referred to as “CY18E P/E”; and
 

 •  the ratio of stock price to estimated EPS for calendar year 2019, referred to as “CY19E P/E”.

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:
 

Infinity Selected Companies   

Price to
9/30/17
TBVPS    

Price to
9/30/17
BVPS    CY 18E P/E   CY 19E P/E 

Kemper    1.69x    1.43x    14.2x    13.0x 
Mercury General Corporation    1.41x    1.35x    14.4x    12.8x 
National General Insurance Co.    2.09x    1.29x    8.1x    7.1x

Median    1.63x    1.39x    14.3x    12.9x 

Based in part upon the multiples of the Infinity selected companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment and
experience, Deutsche Bank then calculated the following ranges of implied values per share of Infinity common stock on a fully diluted basis:
 

 •  approximately $93.85 to $105.58 per share by applying multiples of 1.60x to 1.80x to Infinity’s TBVPS as of September 30, 2017;
 

 •  approximately $85.17 to $98.28 per share by applying multiples of 1.30x to 1.50x to Infinity’s BVPS as of September 30, 2017;
 

 •  approximately $86.19 to $106.08 per share by applying multiples of 13.0x to 16.0x to Infinity management estimates of 2018 EPS; and
 

 •  approximately $88.44 to $111.51 per share by applying multiples of 11.5x to 14.5x to Infinity management estimates of 2019 EPS.

Selected Transaction Analysis

Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available information relating to the following seven personal auto insurance control transactions
announced since January 1, 2009 with transaction equity values greater than $150 million, referred to herein as the “selected transactions”:
 

Date Announced   Acquirer   Target
06/24/2016   National General Insurance Co.   Elara Holdings Inc./Direct General Corporation
06/10/2013   Travelers Co TRV   Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.

02/02/2010   Tower Group Inc.   OneBeacon Insurance Group—Personal Lines Business
04/16/2009   Farmers Group Inc.   21st century (AIG Personal Auto)

The analysis of selected transactions was not simply mathematical, rather, it involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected
in the opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the target companies involved in the selected
transactions and other factors that could affect the acquisition value of such companies.

With respect to each selected transaction and based on publicly available information, Deutsche Bank reviewed the publicly reported multiples or,
as applicable, calculated the multiple of price to the target company’s reported book value per share as of the last completed quarter prior to
announcement.

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:
 

Selected Transactions   P/BV  
National General Insurance Co. /
Elara Holdings Inc./Direct General
Corporation    0.96x 
Travelers Co TRV / Dominion of
Canada General Insurance Co.    1.27x

Farmers Group Inc. / 21st century
(AIG Personal Auto)    0.85x 
Mean    1.28x 
Median    1.27x 

Based in part upon the multiples for the selected transactions described above and taking into account its professional judgment and experience,
Deutsche Bank applied a range of multiples of price to book value per share of 1.00x to 1.80x to Infinity’s book value per share as of December 31,
2017 to derive a range of implied values per share of Infinity common stock of approximately $65.87 to $118.57 per share.

Dividend Discount Analysis

Deutsche Bank performed a dividend discount analysis pursuant to which the value of Infinity common stock was estimated by adding (1) the
estimated net present value of Infinity’s future stream of dividend payments to Infinity shareholders for the years 2018 through 2020 plus (2) the
estimated net present value of the terminal value of Infinity at the end of 2020 based upon certain operating and financial assumptions, forecasts and
other information provided to Deutsche Bank by the management of Infinity. For purposes of such analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized discount rates of
10.5% to 12.5% and terminal values based on multiples of 1.60x to 1.80x projected tangible book value at the end of 2020 and 13.0x to 16.0x projected
net income for 2021. For purposes of its analysis, at the direction of Infinity’s management, Deutsche Bank derived Infinity’s tangible book value by
subtracting Infinity’s publicly reported goodwill as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from Infinity’s estimated ending book value for calendar
years 2018 and 2019, in each case as provided by Infinity management.

This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Infinity common stock of approximately $89.07 to $129.08 per share as of
December 31, 2017.

Additional Information

Deutsche Bank observed certain additional information that was not considered part of Deutsche Bank’s financial analysis with respect to its
opinion but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:
 

 
•  the historical trading performance of the Infinity common stock over the 52-week period ended February 9, 2018, which indicated low to

high intraday stock prices for the Infinity common stock during such period of $83.00 to $110.63 per share; and
 

 
•  publicly available one-year forward Wall Street research analysts’ stock price targets for the Infinity common stock, which ranged from a

low of $92.00 per share to a high of $115.00 per share.

Kemper Material Financial Analyses

Selected Companies Analysis

Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for Kemper with corresponding
financial information and valuation measurements for the following four publicly traded companies, referred to in this section as the “Kemper selected
companies”:
 

 •  Mercury General Corporation
 

 •  National General Insurance Co.
 

 •  Safety Insurance Group, Inc.
 

 •  Infinity

Although none of the Kemper selected companies is directly comparable to Kemper, the companies included were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with financial and operating characteristics that, for purpose of analysis, may be considered similar to certain financial or
operating characteristics of Kemper. Accordingly, the analysis of the Kemper selected companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it involved
complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the Kemper selected companies and other factors that could affect the public trading values of such companies.

Based on the closing prices of the common stock of the Kemper selected companies on February 9, 2018, information contained in the most recent
public filings of the Kemper selected companies, and analyst consensus estimates of operating earnings per share for calendar years 2018 and 2019 for
the Kemper selected companies, Deutsche Bank calculated the following multiples for each of the Kemper selected companies:
 

 •  the ratio of stock price to TBVPS as of September 30, 2017;
 

 •  the ratio of stock price to BVPS as of September 30, 2017;

Based in part upon the multiples of the Kemper selected companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment and
experience, Deutsche Bank then calculated the following ranges of implied values per share of Kemper common stock on a fully diluted basis:
 

 •  approximately $51.30 to $58.14 per share by applying multiples of 1.50x to 1.70x to Kemper’s TBVPS as of September 30, 2017;
 

 •  approximately $52.62 to $60.71 per share by applying multiples of 1.30x to 1.50x to Kemper’s BVPS as of September 2017;
 

 
•  approximately $54.79 to $66.96 per share by applying multiples of 13.5x to 16.5x to estimates of Kemper’s 2018 EPS as derived by

Deutsche Bank as described below; and
 

 
•  approximately $55.27 to $68.54 per share by applying multiples of 12.5x to 15.5x to estimates of Kemper’s 2019 EPS as derived by

Deutsche Bank as described below.

For purposes of this analysis, at the direction of Infinity’s management, Deutsche Bank derived Kemper’s estimated 2018 and 2019 EPS by
dividing the estimates of Kemper’s 2018 and 2019 net income provided by Infinity’s management by Kemper’s fully diluted share count (using the
treasury stock method).

Dividend Discount Analysis

Deutsche Bank performed a dividend discount analysis pursuant to which the value of Kemper common stock was estimated by adding (1) the
estimated net present value of Kemper’s future stream of dividend payments to Kemper stockholders for the years 2018 through 2020 plus (2) the
estimated net present value of the terminal value of Kemper at the end of 2020 based upon certain operating and financial assumptions, forecasts and
other information provided to Deutsche Bank by the management of Infinity. For purposes of such analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized discount rates of
9.5% to 11.5% and terminal values based on multiples of 1.60x to 1.80x projected tangible book value at the end of 2020 and 13.0x to 16.0x projected
net income for 2021. For purposes of its analysis, at the direction of Infinity’s management, Deutsche Bank derived Kemper’s tangible book value by
subtracting Kemper’s publicly reported goodwill as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from Kemper’s estimated ending book value for
calendar years 2018 and 2019, in each case as provided by Infinity’s management. In addition, also at the direction of Infinity’s management Deutsche
Bank derived Kemper’s estimated 2021 net income by applying a growth rate of 11% (representing the average net income growth rate for the prior two
years) to Kemper’s estimated 2020 net income as provided by Infinity’s management.

This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Kemper common stock of approximately $54.31 to $70.02 per share as of
December 31, 2017.

Additional Information

Deutsche Bank observed certain additional information that was not considered part of Deutsche Bank’s financial analysis with respect to its
opinion but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:
 

 
•  the historical trading performance of the Kemper common stock over the 52-week period ended February 9, 2018, which indicated low to

high intraday stock prices for the Kemper common stock during such period of approximately $36.35 to $71.52 per share; and
 

 
•  publicly available one-year forward Wall Street research analysts’ stock price targets for the Kemper common stock, which ranged from a

low of $70.00 to a high of $75.00 per share.

Hypothetical Value to Infinity Shareholders

Deutsche Bank also presented a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the hypothetical value to holders of Infinity common stock of the Mixed
Consideration assuming $51.60 per share in cash and 1.1903 shares of Kemper common stock per share of Infinity common stock (which was the
implied exchange ratio for 60% of the nominal $129.00 agreed value per share of Infinity common stock based on the 20-trading day volume-weighted
average price of the Kemper common stock on February 9, 2018):

Miscellaneous

This summary is not a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s opinion or the underlying analyses and factors considered in connection with
Deutsche Bank’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business and financial
judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses described
above must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses
and factors could create a misleading view of the process underlying its opinion. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the Deutsche Bank opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Deutsche Bank considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, it
made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company
or transaction in the analyses described above is identical to Infinity, Kemper or the Merger.

In conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses
were prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Infinity common stock (excluding Kemper and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion and do not purport to be
appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty. As
described above, in connection with its analyses, Deutsche Bank made, and was provided by the management of Infinity with, numerous assumptions
with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Deutsche

Bank, Infinity or Kemper. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual past or future values or
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Infinity, Kemper or their respective advisors, Deutsche Bank does not assume
responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.

The terms of the Merger, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Infinity and Kemper
and were approved by the Infinity Board. Although Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Infinity Board during the course of these negotiations, the
decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Infinity Board. Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration to
Infinity or the Infinity Board, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. As
described above, the opinion of Deutsche Bank and its presentation to the Infinity Board were among a number of factors taken into consideration by the
Infinity Board in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

Kemper’s Dividend Policy

Each share of Kemper common stock is entitled to receive a dividend when declared by the Kemper Board. Kemper has paid quarterly dividends
since September 5, 1990 and intends to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to its stockholders. However, any decision to pay dividends on its
common stock will be at the discretion of the Kemper Board, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at an amount less than it has
historically paid. The Kemper Board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon Kemper’s profitability and financial condition, contractual
restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC and other factors that the Kemper Board deems relevant. As a holding company with no
significant business operations of its own, Kemper relies on dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its
stockholders. Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations that limit their
ability to declare and pay dividends. These laws and regulations impose minimum solvency and liquidity requirements on dividends between affiliated
companies and require prior notice to, and may require approval from, state insurance regulators before dividends can be paid. In addition, third-party
rating agencies monitor statutory capital and surplus levels for capital adequacy. Even though a dividend may be payable to Kemper from one of its
insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval, such insurance subsidiary may forgo paying a dividend to Kemper and retain the capital to maintain
or improve the ratings of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries, or to offset increases in required capital from increases in premium volume or investment
risk. The inability of one or more of Kemper’s insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to Kemper may materially affect Kemper’s ability to
pay dividends to its stockholders.

Regulatory Approvals

U.S. Antitrust Clearance

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the Merger may not be completed until notification and report forms have
been filed with the FTC and the DOJ and the applicable waiting periods have expired. On February 28, 2018, Kemper and Infinity each filed a
notification and report form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the DOJ. Early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act was granted by
the FTC on March 12, 2018.

Insurance Regulatory Approvals

The insurance laws and regulations of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia generally require that before the acquisition of control of an
insurance company, either through the acquisition of or merger with the insurance company or a holding company of that insurance company, the
acquiring party must obtain approval from the state insurance regulatory authority of the insurance company’s state of domicile (or state of commercial
domicile, if applicable). In addition, many U.S. state insurance laws require prior notification to state

Table of Contents

insurance regulatory authorities of an acquisition of control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state if the acquisition would
result in specified levels of market concentration. While these prior-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulatory authorities to
disapprove the acquisition of control, they authorize regulatory action in the affected state, including requiring the insurance company to cease and
desist from doing certain types of business in the affected state or denying an application for a license to do business in the affected state, if particular
conditions exist, such as substantially lessening of competition in any line of business in such state.

Applications or notifications in connection with the Merger or the changes in control of various subsidiaries of Infinity that may be deemed to
occur as a result of the Merger have been filed, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, with various U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities, including the
California Department of Insurance, the Indiana Department of Insurance, the Ohio Department of Insurance and the Texas Department of Insurance.

Although Kemper and Infinity do not expect those insurance regulatory authorities to raise any significant concerns in connection with their
review of the Merger, there is no assurance that Kemper and Infinity will obtain all required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.

Other than the approvals and notifications described above, neither Kemper nor Infinity is aware of any material regulatory approvals required to
be obtained, or waiting periods required to expire, after the making of a filing. If the parties discover that other approvals or filings and waiting periods
are necessary, they will seek to obtain or comply with them, although, as is the case with the regulatory approvals described above, there can be no
assurance that they will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. However, if any such regulatory approvals shall impose a materially burdensome
condition, Kemper and Merger Sub will not be obligated to complete the Merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the
Merger” beginning on page 188.

Commitment to Obtain Third-Party Approvals

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Kemper and Infinity have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including: (i) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and
approvals from governmental entities and making all necessary registrations, filings and notifications and taking all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, non-action letter, waiver or exemption from any governmental entity (including under the HSR Act and the
requisite regulatory approvals); (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-governmental third
parties; (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other governmental entity vacated or reversed, but excluding any lawsuits or other legal proceedings brought by or against any insurance
regulator; and (iv) executing and delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and to carry out the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kemper and its subsidiaries will not be obligated to, and
Infinity and its subsidiaries will not, without the prior written consent of Kemper, consent to, take or refrain from taking any action that shall constitute a
materially burdensome condition. See “The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Complete the Merger” beginning on page 201.

Other than the approvals and notifications described above, neither Kemper nor Infinity is aware of any material regulatory approvals required to
be obtained, or waiting periods required to expire, after the making of a filing. If the parties discover that other approvals or filings and waiting periods
are necessary, they will seek to obtain or comply with them, although, as is the case with the regulatory approvals described above, there can be no
assurance that they will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. While Kemper and Infinity believe that they will receive the requisite regulatory
approvals for the Merger, there can be no assurances regarding the timing of

the approvals, their ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of litigation challenging these approvals. There can likewise be
no assurance that U.S. federal or state regulatory authorities including state insurance regulators will not attempt to challenge the Merger on antitrust
grounds or for other reasons, or, if a challenge is made, as to the results of the challenge. Kemper’s and Infinity’s obligation to complete the Merger is
conditioned upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals from regulators and other governmental authorities. However, if any such regulatory
approvals shall impose a materially burdensome condition, Kemper and Merger Sub will not be obligated to complete the Merger. See “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 188.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (in each case, as
defined below) of (i) the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger and (ii) the
ownership and disposition of any shares of Kemper common stock received in the Merger in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock. This
discussion is based upon the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative authorities, rulings and
decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These authorities may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any
such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any state, local or
non-U.S. tax consequences, the Medicare tax on net investment income (under Section 1411 of the Code) or any U.S. federal tax consequences other
than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), or the courts and,
therefore, could be subject to challenge, which could be sustained.

This discussion applies only to holders (as defined below) that hold shares of Infinity common stock as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and to non-U.S. holders that will hold any shares of Kemper common stock received
in the Merger in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock as capital assets. Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that might be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances and does not apply to holders subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as, but not limited to, dealers or brokers in securities, commodities or non-U.S. currencies,
traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, banks and certain other financial institutions, insurance companies,
mutual funds, tax-exempt organizations, holders liable for the alternative minimum tax, partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities or
investors in partnerships, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
companies, former citizens or residents of the United States, U.S. expatriates, non-U.S. governments and their controlled entities, U.S. holders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, holders who hold shares of Infinity common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
transaction or other integrated investment, or holders who acquired shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options,
through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation).

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of Infinity common stock, the tax treatment
of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any such entity should consult its
own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of (i) the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock pursuant
to the Merger and (ii) the ownership and disposition of any shares of Kemper common stock received in the Merger in exchange for shares of Infinity
common stock.

Holders of shares of Infinity common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of (i) the receipt of the
Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger and (ii) the ownership and disposition of any shares of
Kemper common stock received in the Merger in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock, in each case including the applicability

and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. and other tax laws, in light of their particular circumstances.

Tax Consequences to U.S. holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Infinity common stock that is:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, as defined in the Code;
 

 
•  a corporation (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under

the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S.

persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it was in existence on August 20, 1996 and it has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

 

 •  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

Receipt of the Merger Consideration in Exchange for Shares of Infinity Common Stock pursuant to the Merger by U.S. holders

The receipt of the Merger Consideration by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder who receives the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of Infinity
common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between (i) the amount of any cash received (including any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Kemper common stock) and the fair market
value (as of the closing) of any shares of Kemper common stock received in such exchange and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares of
Infinity common stock. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of shares of Infinity common stock (i.e., shares acquired for the same
cost in a single transaction) disposed of pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares of Infinity common stock is more than one year as of the date of the Merger.
Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in any shares of Kemper common stock received in
the Merger will equal the fair market value of such shares as of the closing. The holding period of any shares of Kemper common stock received in the
Merger will begin on the day after the Merger.

Ownership of Shares of Kemper Common Stock Received in the Merger by U.S. holders

A distribution of cash or other property (other than certain pro rata distributions of shares of Kemper common stock or rights to acquire shares of
Kemper common stock) made to a U.S. holder with respect to a share of Kemper common stock received in the Merger generally will be treated as a
dividend to the extent it is paid from Kemper’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). If
the amount of such distribution exceeds Kemper’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess generally will be treated first as a tax-free
return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such share of Kemper common stock, and then as capital gain (which will be
treated in the manner described below under “—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Shares of Kemper Common Stock by U.S. holders”).

Distributions treated as dividends that are received by non-corporate holders of Kemper common stock generally will be subject to a reduced U.S.
federal income tax rate if such holders meet certain holding period
 

167



9/30/2019 DEFM14A

Table of Contents

and other applicable requirements. If a dividend received by a non-corporate holder that qualifies for the rate reduction is an “extraordinary dividend”
within the meaning of Section 1059 of the Code, any loss recognized by such non-corporate holder on a subsequent disposition of the stock will be
treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such “extraordinary dividend,” irrespective of such holder’s holding period for the stock.

Subject to certain limitations (including holding period requirements), distributions on Kemper common stock constituting dividends paid out of
earnings and profits to U.S. holders that are corporations generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction. Any distribution (or the portion of
any distribution) that exceeds Kemper’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction.

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Shares of Kemper Common Stock by U.S. holders

U.S. holders generally will recognize capital gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of Kemper common stock equal to the difference between
the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition and the adjusted tax basis in the shares sold or exchanged. Such capital gain or loss generally will
be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the shares sold or exchanged is more than one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals
generally are subject to a reduced rate of taxation. The deductibility of net capital losses is subject to limitations.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for U.S. holders

The receipt of the Merger Consideration by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger, the amount of
dividends paid to U.S. holders on shares of Kemper common stock, and proceeds received from the disposition of Kemper common stock generally will
be subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder
should timely complete and return IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a “United States person” as defined under the Code, the taxpayer
identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. Certain types of U.S. holders (including, with
respect to certain types of payments, corporations) generally are not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability if the required information is furnished by such holder on a timely basis to the IRS.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. holder” means (i) a beneficial owner of shares of Infinity common stock that is not a U.S.
holder and is not an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) after the closing, a beneficial owner
described in clause (i) that beneficially owns shares of Kemper common stock received in the Merger in exchange for his or her shares of Infinity
common stock.

Receipt of the Merger Consideration in Exchange for Shares of Infinity Common Stock Pursuant to the Merger by non-U.S. holders

Subject to the discussion below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for non-U.S. holders,” the receipt of the Merger
Consideration by non-U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Infinity common stock pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:
 

 

•  the gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States), in
which event (i) the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in substantially the same manner as if it were a U.S.
holder and (ii) if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as
may be specified under an applicable

income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the United States for the taxable year, subject to
certain adjustments;

 

 

•  the non-U.S. holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares
of Infinity common stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which event the
non-U.S. holder will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on the
gain from the exchange of shares of Infinity common stock net of applicable U.S. capital losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets
recognized during the year; or

 

 
•  Infinity is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”), as defined in Section 897 of the Code at any time within the

five-year period preceding the Merger and certain other conditions are satisfied (Infinity believes that, as of the effective time, Infinity will
not have been a USRPHC at any time within the five-year period ending on the date thereof).

Ownership of Shares of Kemper Common Stock Received in the Merger by non-U.S. holders

A distribution of cash or other property (other than certain pro rata distributions of shares of Kemper common stock or rights to acquire shares of
Kemper common stock) made to a non-U.S. holder with respect to a share of Kemper common stock received in the Merger generally will be treated as
a dividend to the extent it is paid from Kemper’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). If
the amount of such distribution exceeds Kemper’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess generally will be treated first as a tax-free
return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such share of Kemper common stock, and then as capital gain (which will be
treated in the manner described below under “—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Shares of Kemper Common Stock by non-U.S. holders”).

A distribution treated as a dividend on a share of Kemper common stock that is paid to or for the account of a non-U.S. holder generally will be
subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30%, or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty if the non-U.S.
holder provides the documentation (generally IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) required to claim benefits under such tax treaty to the applicable
withholding agent. Even if Kemper’s current or accumulated earnings and profits are less than the amount of the distribution, the applicable withholding
agent may elect to treat the entire distribution as a dividend for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes. Each non-U.S. holder should consult its own tax
advisor regarding U.S. federal withholding tax on distributions, including such non-U.S. holder’s eligibility for a lower rate and the availability of a
refund of any excess U.S. federal tax withheld.

If, however, a dividend is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States), such dividend
generally will not be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax if such non-U.S. holder provides the appropriate documentation (generally, IRS
Form W-8ECI) to the applicable withholding agent. Instead, such non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such dividend
in substantially the same manner as a U.S. person. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively
connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the United States for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

The foregoing discussion is subject to the discussion below under “—FATCA Withholding” and “—Information Reporting and Backup
Withholding for non-U.S. holders.”

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Shares of Kemper Common Stock by non-U.S. holders

A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of
shares of Kemper common stock received in the Merger unless:
 

 

•  such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States), in which event such
non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain in substantially the same manner as a U.S. person and, if it
is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower
rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits that are not reinvested in the
United States for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments;

 

 

•  such non-U.S. holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of such sale, exchange
or other disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which event such non-U.S. holder will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or such
lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of
Kemper common stock net of applicable U.S. capital losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets recognized during the year; or

 

 
•  Kemper is or has been a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of (i) the five-year period ending on

the date of such sale, exchange or other disposition and (ii) such non-U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to such common stock, and
certain other conditions are met (Kemper believes that it presently is not, and does not presently anticipate that it will become, a USRPHC).

The foregoing discussion is subject to the discussion below under “—FATCA Withholding” and “—Information Reporting and Backup
Withholding for non-U.S. holders.”

FATCA Withholding

Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act provisions of the Code and related U.S. Treasury guidance (“FATCA”), a withholding tax of 30%
will be imposed in certain circumstances on payments of (i) dividends on shares of Kemper common stock and (ii) on or after January 1, 2019, gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of shares of Kemper common stock. In the case of payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (such as
a bank, a broker, an investment fund or, in certain cases, a holding company), as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary, this tax generally will be
imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such institution (i) has agreed to (and does) comply with the requirements of an agreement with the United
States (an “FFI Agreement”) or (ii) is required by (and does comply with) applicable non-U.S. law enacted in connection with an intergovernmental
agreement between the United States and a non-U.S. jurisdiction (an “IGA”) to, among other things, collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities or
other relevant tax authorities certain information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution and, in either case, such institution provides the
withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status. In the case of payments made to a non-U.S. entity that is not a financial institution (as a
beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), the tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such entity
provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status and, in certain cases, identifies any “substantial” U.S. owner (generally, any
specified U.S. person that directly or indirectly owns more than a specified percentage of such entity). If shares of Kemper common stock are held
through a foreign financial institution that has agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement or is subject to similar requirements under
applicable non-U.S. law enacted in connection with an IGA, such foreign financial institution (or, in certain cases, a person paying amounts to such
foreign financial institution) generally will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to withhold tax on payments made to (i) a person (including an
individual) that fails to provide any required information or documentation or (ii) a foreign financial institution that has not agreed to comply with the
requirements of an FFI Agreement and is not subject to similar requirements under applicable non-U.S. law enacted in connection with an IGA. Each
non-U.S. holder

should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of FATCA to the ownership and disposition of any shares of Kemper common stock
received in the Merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for non-U.S. holders

Amounts paid to a non-U.S. holder that are treated as payments of dividends on shares of Kemper common stock and the amount of any U.S.
federal tax withheld from such payments generally will be reported annually to the IRS and to such non-U.S. holder by the applicable withholding agent.

The information reporting and backup withholding rules that apply to payments of dividends to certain U.S. persons generally will not apply to
payments of dividends on shares of Kemper common stock to a non-U.S. holder if such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not
a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of Kemper common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected outside the United States
through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to the information reporting and backup withholding rules that apply to
payments to certain U.S. persons, provided that the proceeds are paid to the non-U.S. holder outside the United States. However, proceeds from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of shares of Kemper common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker with
certain specified U.S. connections or of a U.S. broker generally will be subject to these information reporting rules (but generally not to these backup
withholding rules), even if the proceeds are paid to such non-U.S. holder outside the United States, unless such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties
of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or otherwise
establishes an exemption. Proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of Kemper common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected
through a U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to these information reporting and backup withholding rules unless such non-U.S. holder
certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable
withholding agent) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a
credit against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is furnished by such non-U.S. holder on a timely basis to
the IRS.

Accounting Treatment

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 805 requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. In
applying the acquisition method, it is necessary to identify the acquirer and the acquiree for accounting purposes. In a business combination effected
through an exchange of equity interests, the entity that issues the equity interests is generally considered the acquirer, but there are other factors in ASC
805 that must also be considered. Kemper management considered these other factors and determined that Kemper will be considered the acquirer of
Infinity for accounting purposes. The total purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Infinity based on their fair
values as of the date of the completion of the transactions, with any excess allocated to goodwill. Reports of financial condition and results of operations
of Kemper issued after the closing will include Infinity’s balances and results after the closing, and Kemper’s historical financial position and results of
operations will not be restated retroactively to include the historical financial position or results of operations of Infinity prior to the closing. Following
the closing, the earnings of the combined company will include acquisition accounting adjustments (e.g., additional depreciation of property, plant and
equipment, amortization of identified intangible assets or other impacts from the purchase price allocation).

In accordance with the FASB ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill resulting from the purchase business combination will not be
amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually

(more frequently if certain indicators are present). If Kemper management determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined
company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.

Listing of Kemper Common Stock

It is a condition to the closing that the shares of Kemper common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and Deregistration of Infinity Common Stock

If the Merger is completed, Infinity common stock will be, pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, delisted from NASDAQ and
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Infinity will no longer be publicly traded or file periodic reports with the SEC.

Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the Infinity recommendation, Infinity shareholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of Infinity have certain
interests in the Merger that may be different from or in addition to the interests of Infinity shareholders generally. The Infinity Board was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other things, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Infinity Board considered
these interests in recommending that the Infinity shareholders approve the merger proposal. These interests are discussed below.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the tables in the section entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Infinity’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” below, were used:
 

 •  The closing constitutes a change of control for purpose of each applicable compensation plan or agreement;
 

 
•  The change in control was completed on the effective time, which is assumed to be April 20, 2018, the latest practicable date prior to the

filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;
 

 
•  Each named executive officer’s employment was terminated without “cause” or with “good reason” immediately following the change of

control;
 

 
•  The relevant price per share of Infinity common stock is $120.75, which is the closing price per share of Infinity’s common stock as quoted

on the NASDAQ on April 20, 2018; and
 

 
•  The value of all Infinity performance share awards is estimated assuming achievement of the applicable performance goals at target,

including performance awards that have a performance period ending in 2017 because the actual level of achievement has not yet been
determined by the Infinity Board’s Compensation Committee with respect to those Infinity performance share awards.

Treatment of Infinity Equity Awards in the Merger

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, certain of Infinity’s executive officers and directors hold Infinity performance share awards and
Infinity restricted shares. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, as of the effective time: (i) each outstanding Infinity performance share award will
vest with respect to the target share amount and will be converted into shares of Kemper common stock (provided that any such shares of Kemper
common stock held after payment of required withholding taxes may not be sold or transferred prior to the first anniversary of the date of the closing),
with the number of such shares of Kemper common stock subject to each

Infinity performance share award determined by multiplying the target share amount by the exchange ratio; (ii) each outstanding award of Director
Restricted Shares will vest in full and be eligible to receive the Merger Consideration; and (iii) each outstanding award of Infinity restricted shares (other
than Director Restricted Shares) will be cancelled without any acceleration of vesting and in exchange Kemper will grant the Rollover RSUs determined
by multiplying the number of cancelled Infinity restricted shares by the exchange ratio, with such Rollover RSUs vesting in accordance with any
applicable award or other agreement between the recipient of such Rollover RSUs and Kemper (or an affiliate thereof). The Rollover RSUs will be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Kemper Plan, as well as any applicable award agreement.

See the section entitled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Infinity’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger” for an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each of Infinity’s named executive officers in respect of their unvested Infinity
stock-based awards. Based on the assumptions described under “—Certain Assumptions” and the additional assumptions used for purposes of
estimating amounts for non-employee directors, the estimated aggregate amount that would become payable to Infinity’s non-employee directors in
respect of their Director Restricted Shares is $0, which reflects the fact that Infinity’s non-employee directors are not receiving their annual equity grants
for 2018 (see “Cash Payment to Directors” below) and therefore will not hold unvested Director Restricted Shares at closing.

For more information on equity holdings of Infinity’s non-employee directors and executive officers, see the section entitled “Ownership of
Infinity Common Stock.”

Payment Upon Termination of Employment Under Individual Agreements

Kemper Retention Letter Agreements with Glen N. Godwin, Samuel J. Simon and Robert H. Bateman

In connection with the Merger, on February 13, 2018, Messrs. Godwin, Simon and Bateman each entered into a letter agreement with Kemper
(collectively, the “Letter Agreements”), which describe the terms of each executive’s employment with Kemper following the effective time. Provided
that each executive continues to be employed with Infinity through the effective time, the applicable Letter Agreement will become effective upon, and
subject to, the effective time and will extend the term of the executive’s employment agreement with Infinity until the second anniversary of the closing
(the “Term”).

Under the Letter Agreements, Mr. Godwin will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Infinity (which will be a wholly owned subsidiary
of Kemper upon the closing), Mr. Simon will continue to serve as President and General Counsel of Infinity, and Mr. Bateman will continue to serve as
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Infinity. Each executive will continue to receive an annual base salary during the Term that is
not less than his current base salary of $550,000 (for Mr. Godwin), $475,000 (for Mr. Simon) or $400,000 (for Mr. Bateman) and will be entitled to
receive an annual bonus under Kemper’s annual bonus program for each year during the Term, but with a minimum annual bonus in the amount of
100% of his base salary (prorated for partial years of employment), payable at the same time as paid to other management employees and subject to the
executive’s continued employment through such payment date.

The Letter Agreements also provide that each executive will be entitled to receive a retention bonus equal to the cash severance benefit that he
would have received under his current employment agreement with Infinity if his employment had been terminated by Infinity immediately prior to the
expiration of the Term for a reason other than cause (as defined in each executive’s current employment agreement). The retention bonus will be paid
within thirty (30) days after the end of the Term. If an executive’s employment is terminated by the combined company prior to the expiration of the
Term for a reason other than cause (as defined in the executive’s current employment agreement) or the executive resigns during the Term for good
reason (as defined below), the executive will not be entitled to the retention bonus described above but will be entitled to the severance benefits payable
under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, his current employment agreement. An executive will not be entitled to any severance benefits if his
employment is terminated by the combined

Table of Contents

company for cause (as defined in the executive’s current employment agreement) or if he resigns without good reason (as defined below). The severance
benefits payable under each executive’s current employment agreement upon such qualifying termination are as follows (in addition to the payment of
certain accrued obligations):
 

 
•  Lump-sum payment of two (2) times the executive’s most recent annual base salary, paid sixty (60) days following the executive’s

termination of employment;
 

 
•  Lump-sum payment, paid sixty (60) days following the executive’s termination of employment, equal to the sum of (i) the executive’s

annual bonus target, pro-rated based on the actual number of days elapsed in the year in which the executive’s termination takes place, plus
(ii) two (2) times the executive’s annual bonus target;

 

 
•  For a period of eighteen (18) months following the executive’s termination of employment (the “Post-Termination Benefit Period”),

employer-subsidized continuation of certain health and welfare benefits; and
 

 
•  Cash payment in lieu of 401(k) plan matching and supplemental contributions in respect of the Post-Termination Benefit Period (based on

applicable eligible wages, matching elections, earnings and contribution percentages as in effect prior to termination), paid in a lump sum
within two and a half months following the termination.

For purposes of the Letter Agreements, “good reason” has the same meaning as set forth in each executive’s current employment agreement
except that clause (I) of that definition is amended and restated to mean the assignment to the executive of duties that are materially inconsistent with his
position with the combined company after the closing or a material adverse diminution in the nature of his responsibilities or authority from those in
effect immediately after the closing, and will not include the changes to his position caused by the Merger, by Infinity becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of Kemper or by Infinity ceasing to be a public company.

The Letter Agreements provide that each executive will not sell or transfer the shares of Kemper common stock received in respect of their
Infinity performance share unit awards prior to the 12-month anniversary of the closing. In addition, the Letter Agreements provide that the Rollover
RSUs granted to each executive pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement will vest in full upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Term or
(ii) the original vesting date of each executive’s Infinity restricted shares prior to being cancelled and replaced by the Rollover RSUs, provided that the
executive remains in continuous employment with the combined company through such applicable date and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Kemper Plan and the applicable award agreement. If an executive’s employment is terminated prior to the expiration of the Term by the combined
company for a reason other than cause (as defined in the executive’s current employment agreement), the vesting of the Rollover RSUs will accelerate
as of the date of termination (subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a waiver and release in accordance with the terms of his current
employment agreement).

The Letter Agreements also provide that Kemper will, as soon as practicable after the closing, grant each executive a special award of time-vested
restricted stock units having a grant date value equal to $1,000,000. The special grant will vest in full at the expiration of the Term, provided that the
executive remains in continuous employment with the combined company through that date and subject to the terms and conditions of the Kemper Plan
and the applicable award agreement. If an executive’s employment is terminated prior to the expiration of the Term by the combined company for a
reason other than cause (as defined in the executive’s current employment agreement), the vesting of the special grant will accelerate as of the date of
termination (subject to the executive’s execution and non-revocation of a waiver and release in accordance with the terms of his current employment
agreement). The shares of Kemper common stock that are subject to the special grant and that become vested will be payable to the executive 12 months
after they become vested, provided that the executive is in compliance with the restrictive covenants included in his current employment agreement and
the special grant award agreement during such 12-month period.

Table of Contents

The Letter Agreements further provide that each executive will be eligible for annual grants of equity awards under the Kemper Plan, consistent
with similarly situated Kemper officers, and they will be entitled to participate in Kemper’s 401(k), medical, life insurance and disability benefit plans
enjoyed by similarly situated officers. During the Term, each executive will be eligible for severance benefits only as provided under their current
employment agreements (as amended by the Letter Agreements) and not under any other severance plan, policy or agreement maintained by the
combined company.

Cash Payments to Directors

Pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement dated September 11, 2014 between Infinity and James R. Gober, Infinity’s Executive
Chairman of the Board of Directors, as amended (the “Gober Employment Agreement”), Mr. Gober’s employment term expired February 28, 2018. In
connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Infinity Board deemed it in the best interests of Infinity and its shareholders to maintain the
continuity of management, operational and regulatory affairs, and corporate governance leadership provided by Mr. Gober’s continued employment.
Therefore, the Infinity Board approved the extension of Mr. Gober’s employment term for a period commencing March 1, 2018 through the effective
time, and as payment for such continued service, the Infinity Board approved a salary in the amount of $287,500 per annum, payable in accordance with
Infinity’s normal payroll practices, for the duration of the extended term of Mr. Gober’s employment.

As discussed in the section entitled “The Merger—Background of the Merger” beginning on page 122, the Infinity Board established the Term
Sheet Committee for the purpose of remaining in contact with Infinity management with respect to developments regarding Kemper’s non-binding offer
letters and negotiations of the Merger Agreement. Samuel J. Weinhoff, as Chairman of the Term Sheet Committee, was in contact on various occasions
with Messrs. Godwin or Simon and Joseph P. Lacher Jr. throughout the negotiation process. In addition, Victor T. Adamo, Richard J. Bielen, Teresa A.
Canida and James L. Weidner, as the remaining members of the Term Sheet Committee, kept in contact with Mr. Weinhoff regarding his discussions
with Messrs. Godwin or Simon and Mr. Lacher and in communicating such information to Infinity management throughout the negotiation process. As
compensation for the Term Sheet Committee’s services throughout the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Infinity Board approved a payment to Mr. Weinhoff, as Chairman of the committee, in the amount of $25,000 and payments to each
other member of the Term Sheet Committee in the amount of $20,000, with such payments being paid in the first quarter of 2018.

In accordance with Infinity’s normal practices regarding annual director compensation, each Infinity non-employee director is granted an annual
equity retainer having a value of $80,000 as partial payment of such annual director compensation. Because the equity grant would take place between
the signing and closing of the Merger Agreement, and the Merger Agreement prohibits Infinity from issuing equity between signing and closing, the
Infinity Board agreed to pay all annual director compensation in cash for 2018. As a result, the Infinity Board approved a cash retainer of $80,000 to
each non-employee director in lieu of the normal annual equity retainer, payable on June 1, 2018.

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, certain former Infinity directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the effective time. Such indemnification and insurance
coverage is further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Director and Officer Indemnification” beginning on page 214.

relates to the merger. Under applicable SEC rules, Infinity’s named executive officers for this purpose are required to consist of Infinity’s named
executive officers for whom disclosure was required in Infinity’s most recent proxy statement filed with the SEC, who are:
 

 •  James R. Gober, former Chief Executive Officer;
 

 •  Glen N. Godwin, Chief Executive Officer;
 

 •  Samuel J. Simon, President and General Counsel; and
 

 •  Robert H. Bateman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

To the extent that any of Infinity’s named executive officers’ compensation arrangements are described in “The Merger—Interests of Infinity’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” they are incorporated herein by reference. The amounts set forth in the table below, which represent an
estimate of each named executive officer’s “golden parachute” compensation, as of March 15, 2018, are based on the assumptions set forth above under

termination of employment each of Messrs. Godwin, Simon and Bateman would be entitled to receive the following cash severance benefits: (i) a
lump-sum payment of two times the executive’s most recent annual base salary, paid sixty (60) days following the executive’s termination of
employment; and (ii) a lump-sum payment, paid sixty (60) days following the executive’s termination of employment, equal to the sum of (a) the

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The summary set forth below and elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. This summary does not purport to be complete and
may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. You should read the Merger Agreement carefully in its
entirety, as it is the legal document governing the transaction.

The Merger Agreement and the following summary have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Kemper, Merger Sub or
Infinity or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. That information can be found elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the
other public documents that Kemper and Infinity file with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279.

The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of
specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties,
including being qualified by disclosures not reflected in the Merger Agreement, were made for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the
parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting
parties that differ from those applicable to you and reports and documents filed with the SEC. You are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger
Agreement and you should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state
of facts or condition of Kemper, Merger Sub or Infinity or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully
reflected in Kemper’s or Infinity’s public disclosures.

Structure and Completion of the Merger

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper, will merge with
and into Infinity, with Infinity surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper.

The Merger will occur on the date on which closing of the Merger actually occurs (the “closing date”), which date will be no later than the third
business day after the date upon which all of the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that are waived or
that may only be satisfied on the closing date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions) are satisfied or waived (or on such other date as Kemper
and Infinity may agree). See “—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 188).

The Merger will become effective at the time that the certificate of merger (with respect to the Merger) has been filed with, and accepted by, the
Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, or at such later date and time agreed to by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger (the “effective
time”).

The closing is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable closing conditions. See “—
Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 188.

Merger Consideration

Conversion of Shares

The Merger Agreement provides that at the effective time, each share of Infinity common stock issued and outstanding (other than shares owned
by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its

Table of Contents

subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares under
Ohio law (“appraisal shares”)) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holders of such shares of Infinity common
stock, either (i) a combination of shares of Kemper common stock and cash, (ii) an amount of cash or (iii) shares of Kemper common stock, in each case
as further described below, subject to the automatic proration and adjustment procedures described below under “—Merger Consideration—Cash
Consideration” beginning on page 179, “—Merger Consideration—Stock Consideration” beginning on page 180 and “The Merger Agreement—
Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations” beginning on page 180.

The consideration to be paid to Infinity shareholders electing to receive only Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration is subject, pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, to automatic proration to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of shares of Kemper common
stock issued in the Merger is approximately the same as what would be paid and issued if all Infinity shareholders were to receive the Mixed
Consideration. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Kemper common stock to be issued and the total amount of cash to be paid by Kemper as part
of the Merger Consideration will not change from what was agreed to in the Merger Agreement (other than for adjustment in the event that there is any
change in the outstanding shares or classes of capital stock of Kemper or Infinity as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend or stock distribution
that is declared thereon (a “capital stock adjustment event”)). However, since the market price of Kemper common stock will fluctuate, the total value
of the Mixed Consideration and the value of the Stock Consideration may increase or decrease between the date of the Merger Agreement and the
effective time. Accordingly, the value of the actual per share consideration to be paid to Infinity shareholders cannot be determined until after the
effective time. No fractional shares of Kemper common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Infinity shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Kemper common stock.

Mixed Consideration

The Merger Agreement provides that each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity shareholder makes an election to
receive a fixed combination of cash and Kemper common stock (each, a “mixed consideration electing share”), and each share for which an Infinity
shareholder fails to make any election with respect to such shareholder’s shares of Infinity common stock prior to the Election Deadline (each, a “non-
electing share”), will be converted into the right to receive the Mixed Consideration.

Cash Consideration

The Merger Agreement provides that each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity shareholder makes a valid election to
receive cash (each, a “cash electing share”) will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, provided that the available cash election
amount (as defined below) equals or exceeds the cash election amount (as defined below). The amount of Cash Consideration that each cash electing
share is entitled to receive is referred to as the “per share cash election consideration.”

Notwithstanding anything contained in the first sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, if:
 

 •  the product of (i) the number of cash electing shares and (ii) the per share cash election consideration (the “cash election amount”) exceeds
 

 

•  the difference between (i) the product of (A) $51.60 and (B) the total number of shares of Infinity common stock (other than shares held by
Kemper or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its subsidiaries and appraisal shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time minus (ii) the product of (A) $51.60 and (B) the number of mixed consideration electing
shares (including any non-electing shares) (such difference, the “available cash election amount”),

Table of Contents

then each cash electing share will be converted into a right to receive:
 

 
•  an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product (rounded to two decimal places) of (i) the per share cash election consideration and

(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which will be the available cash election amount and the denominator of which will be the cash election
amount (the “cash fraction”) and

 

 •  a number of shares of Kemper common stock equal to the product of:
 

 
•  (i) the sum (the “exchange ratio”) of 1.2019 shares of Kemper common stock (the “mixed election stock exchange ratio”), plus the quotient

(rounded to four decimal places) of $51.60 divided by $64.40 (i.e., 2.0031), and
 

 •  an amount equal to one, minus the cash fraction.

Stock Consideration

The Merger Agreement provides that each share of Infinity common stock with respect to which an Infinity shareholder makes a valid election to
receive stock (each, a “stock electing share”) will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, provided that the cash election amount
equals or exceeds the available cash election amount.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the first sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph to the contrary, if the available cash election
amount exceeds the cash election amount, then each stock electing share will be converted into the right to receive:
 

 
•  an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the amount (rounded to two decimal places) of such excess divided by the number of stock

electing shares (such fraction, the “excess cash amount”) and
 

 
•  a number of shares of Kemper common stock equal to the product (rounded to four decimal places) of (x) the exchange ratio and (y) a

fraction, the numerator of which will be the per share cash election consideration minus the excess cash amount and the denominator of
which will be the per share cash election consideration (the “stock fraction”).

Allocation of Merger Consideration and Illustrative Elections and Calculations

The aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate number of shares of Kemper common stock to be paid and issued, respectively, to Infinity
shareholders pursuant to the Merger are fixed (in each case subject to adjustment in the event that there is any capital stock adjustment event). If the
elections of all of the Infinity shareholders result in an oversubscription or undersubscription of the available cash election amount, the aggregate
amount of cash or Kemper common stock, as applicable, that is paid to Infinity shareholders will not be adjusted. Rather, the exchange agent will
allocate between cash and shares of Kemper common stock in the manner described above under “—Merger Consideration—Cash Consideration”
beginning on page 179 and “—Merger Consideration—Stock Consideration” beginning on page 180, and as illustrated below to ensure that the total
amount of cash to be paid and the total number of shares of Kemper common stock to be issued by Kemper in the Merger represents approximately 40%
and 60% of the aggregate Merger Consideration, respectively (taking into account the Director Restricted Shares, as described above under “The Merger
—Interests of Infinity’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Infinity Equity Awards in the Merger” beginning on page 172).
Accordingly, there is no assurance that an Infinity shareholder that has made a valid election to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock
Consideration will receive the form or combination of consideration elected with respect to the shares of Infinity common stock held by such
shareholder. See “Risk Factors—Infinity shareholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what they elect.”

Set forth below are illustrations of both an oversubscription of cash and an undersubscription of cash and the resulting automatic proration and
adjustment of those shareholders electing to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration, as applicable.

Manner and Procedure for Exchanging Shares of Infinity Common Stock; No Fractional Shares

Prior to the effective time, Kemper will make available with the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Infinity common stock,
the full number of shares of Kemper common stock issuable in connection with the Merger based on a good faith estimate thereof, and will provide or
will cause to be provided to the exchange agent all of the cash necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration. After the effective time on
the appropriate payment date, if applicable, Kemper will provide or cause to be provided to the exchange agent any dividends or other distributions
payable on such shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Kemper will instruct the exchange agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, to each Infinity shareholder of record
of a share certificate whose shares of Infinity common stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any share certificates will pass, only
upon proper delivery of a form of election and any share certificates to the exchange agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as
Kemper may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the share certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
and matters relating thereto.

Upon surrender of a share certificate for cancellation to the exchange agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Kemper,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the exchange agent, the holder of such share certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash and
the number of whole shares of Kemper common stock (which will be in non-certificated book-entry form) which the aggregate number of shares Infinity
company stock previously represented by such share certificate will have been converted into the right to receive and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Kemper common stock, and the share certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Infinity
common stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Infinity, payment may be made and shares of Kemper common stock may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the share certificate so surrendered is registered, if such share certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise
is in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of such share certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Kemper that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any share certificate.

No holder of book-entry shares of Infinity common stock will be required to deliver a share certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
exchange agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In lieu thereof, each
registered holder of one or more book-entry shares of Infinity common stock will automatically upon the delivery of a form of election (and, in the case
of book-entry shares of Infinity common stock held via a depository, upon receipt by the exchange agent of any customary transmission or materials
required by the exchange agent) be entitled to receive, the Merger

Consideration. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to book-entry shares of Infinity common stock will only be made to the person in
whose name such book-entry shares of Infinity common stock are registered.

The conversion of shares of Infinity common stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will occur automatically at the effective
time. Following the closing, Infinity will not register any transfers of Infinity common stock outstanding on its stock transfer books prior to the Merger.

Kemper will not issue share certificates or scrip, or make any book-entries, representing fractional shares in the Merger. Instead, each holder of
shares of Infinity common stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Kemper common stock will have their fractional shares
aggregated and will be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, from the exchange agent, in lieu of such
fractional shares in an amount equal to the product of:
 

 •  the amount of the fractional interest in a share of Kemper common stock to which such holder is entitled under the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  $64.40 (the “fixed volume-weighted average price”).

Election Procedures

The election form is being mailed to Infinity shareholders with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The election form will allow each Infinity
shareholder to specify the number of shares of Infinity common stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive Cash Consideration, Stock
Consideration or Mixed Consideration. The election must be made prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The Election Deadline will be 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is ten (10) business days before the closing date. Kemper and
Infinity will publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least three (3) business days before the anticipated Election Deadline. If the closing
date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline will be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Kemper and Infinity will, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, announce such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

To make a valid election, each Infinity shareholder must submit a properly completed form of election so that it is actually received by the
exchange agent at its designated office at or prior to the Election Deadline. A form of election will be properly completed and signed and accompanied
by either (i) a share certificate representing shares of Infinity common stock, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the
book of Kemper (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such share certificate as set forth in the form of election from a specified type of firm) or
(ii), in the case of any book-entry shares of Infinity common stock, any documents required by the procedures set forth in the form of election.

In the event any share certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such share
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Kemper or the exchange agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Kemper or the exchange agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such share
certificate, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed share certificate the shares of Kemper common stock and the
cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement had such lost,
stolen or destroyed share certificate been surrendered.

If an Infinity shareholder does not make an election to receive Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration pursuant to the
Merger, the election is not received by the exchange agent by the Election Deadline, or a form of election is improperly completed and/or is not signed,
that shareholder will be deemed not to have made an election. Infinity shareholders not making an election will be deemed to have elected to receive
Mixed Consideration with respect to those shares for which they are deemed not to have made an election.

Any valid election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of shares of Infinity common stock subject thereto by the exchange agent
receiving written notice from the holder thereof prior to the Election Deadline. If a cash election or stock election is so revoked, the shares of Infinity
common stock represented by the applicable form of election will be treated as shares electing Mixed Consideration unless the shareholder properly
makes a contrary election prior to the Election Deadline.

The exchange agent will generally have discretion to determine whether any election or revocation has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the election forms. None of Kemper, Merger Sub, Infinity or the exchange agent will have any obligation to notify
Infinity shareholders of any defect in a form of election.

Treatment of Equity Awards

Infinity Performance Share Awards

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding Infinity performance share award will vest with respect to the target
share amount and will be converted into shares of Kemper common stock, with the number of such shares of Kemper common stock determined by
multiplying the target share amount by the exchange ratio, subject to any required withholding of taxes (which may be paid with such shares of Kemper
common stock); provided that any such shares of Kemper common stock held after payment of required withholding of taxes will not be sold or
transferred (and will be restricted from being sold or transferred) prior to the first anniversary of the closing date; provided, further, that any such shares
of Kemper common stock will not be subject to any forfeiture restrictions.

Infinity Director Restricted Shares

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time, each award of Director Restricted Shares will immediately vest in full and be eligible to
receive Merger Consideration.

Other Infinity Restricted Shares

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time, each award of Infinity restricted shares (other than the Director Restricted Shares) will be
cancelled without any acceleration of vesting and in exchange Kemper will grant, as soon as practicable following the closing, the Rollover RSUs, with
such Rollover RSUs vesting in accordance with any applicable award or other agreement between the recipient of such Rollover RSUs and Kemper (or
an affiliate of Kemper).

Dividends with Respect to Unexchanged Shares

No dividends or distributions with respect to Kemper common stock with a record date after the effective time will be paid to the holder of any
share certificate formerly representing Infinity common stock or any book-entry shares of Infinity common stock with respect to the shares of Kemper
common stock issuable upon surrender of such share certificate or book-entry shares will be paid to any such holder until (i) the surrender of such share
certificate or (ii) in the case of book entry shares, the delivery of a form of election, provided that in the event that book-entry shares are held via a
depository, the payment will not be made until the exchange agent’s receipt of any customary transmission or materials required by the exchange agent.
After the Merger is completed and following such a surrender of a share certificate or delivery of a form of election and, in the case of any book-entry
shares held via a depository, upon receipt by the exchange agent of any customary transmission or materials required by the exchange agent, as
applicable, holders of shares of Infinity common stock will be entitled to (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
effective time which have been paid with respect to such whole shares of Kemper common stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time but prior

to such surrender of share certificates or delivery of a form of election, as the case may be, and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or delivery
with respect to such whole shares of Kemper common stock, in each case without interest.

Termination of Exchange Fund

One year after the closing, the exchange agent will deliver to Kemper any cash or shares of Kemper common stock remaining in the exchange
fund. Thereafter, Infinity shareholders must look only to Kemper for payment of the Merger Consideration on their shares of Infinity common stock and
any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Kemper common stock.

No Liability

None of Kemper, Infinity, Merger Sub or the exchange agent will be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Kemper common stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the exchange fund (including any undistributed portion of the exchange fund) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration
or any dividends or distributions with respect to Kemper common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement in respect of a share of Infinity
common stock would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such share will become the property of the surviving corporation.

Dissenting Rights of Infinity Shareholders

Under the laws of the State of Ohio, the merger proposal can give rise to rights under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL if such proposal is approved
by shareholders at the Infinity special meeting. Under the laws of the State of Ohio, Infinity shareholders of record who do not vote in favor of, or
consent to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement may be entitled to seek appraisal and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair cash
value of their shares of Infinity common stock in connection with the Merger, if the Merger is completed. This value could be more than, less than or the
same as the Merger Consideration for Infinity common stock. The relevant provisions of the OGCL are included as Annex F to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal, Infinity shareholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions will result in a loss of the right of appraisal.

An Infinity shareholder will be entitled to demand and have properly demanded appraisal of its shares of Infinity common stock under
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL only if the shareholder (i) delivers to Infinity a written demand with the information required by Section 1701.85(A)(4) of
the OGCL before the vote on the merger proposal and (ii) does not vote in favor of the merger proposal. If an Infinity shareholder properly submits a
proxy card but does not indicate voting instructions on such proxy card, such shareholder’s shares of Infinity common stock represented by such proxy
card will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal. As a result, any Infinity shareholder who properly submits a proxy not marked “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN” with respect to the merger proposal (even if such shareholder does not vote “FOR” the merger proposal) will be deemed to have waived
dissenters’ rights under the laws of the State of Ohio. However, failure to submit a proxy will not result in the waiver of dissenters’ rights. Infinity
shareholders who wish to exercise their dissenters’ rights and hold shares in the name of a broker or other nominee must instruct their nominees to take
the steps necessary to enable them to demand the fair cash value for their shares. If any person who was entitled to dissenters’ rights fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
finally determines that such holder is not entitled to the remedies provided by Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to his, her or its
shares of Infinity common stock, then the right of such holder under Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to such shares

required withholding of taxes.

Infinity has agreed to serve prompt notice to Kemper of any demands received by Infinity for appraisal of any shares of Infinity common stock,
and Kemper will have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and legal actions and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
effective time, Infinity will not, without the prior written consent of Kemper, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer or commit to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger

of the closing date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date) (without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality, material adverse effect or similar qualification set forth therein) and (iv) the other representations and
warranties of Kemper and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement must be true and correct both when made and as of the closing date (except

certificate from an authorized executive officer of Kemper to that effect;

 

 
•  each of Kemper and Merger Sub having performed or complied in all material respects with its agreements and covenants required by the

Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the effective time, and the receipt by Infinity of a certificate from

Kemper, Infinity or Merger Sub may elect to waive certain of the foregoing conditions in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and
applicable law. However, despite their ability to do so, none of Kemper, Infinity or Merger Sub currently expects to do so. The conditions to closing
relating to the approval by Infinity shareholders of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Infinity shareholder approval”), the approval by
Kemper stockholders of the share issuance proposal (the “Kemper stockholder approval”), the prevention of the Merger by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the receipt of the
requisite regulatory approvals, the approval for listing on the NYSE of the shares of Kemper common stock to be issued to Infinity shareholders in the
Merger, and the effectiveness under the Securities Act of the registration statement on Form S-4 may only be waived by all parties to the Merger
Agreement. If any condition to the closing is waived, Kemper and Infinity will evaluate the materiality of such waiver to determine whether amendment
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies are necessary under applicable law or the rules of the NYSE or NASDAQ. If
Kemper and Infinity determine that any such waiver is not significant enough to require resolicitation of proxies, they will have the discretion to
complete the Merger without seeking further shareholder or stockholder approval, as applicable.

Definition of Material Adverse Effect

In addition to the conditions to closing relating to the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to the Kemper and Infinity, many of
Infinity’s and Kemper’s representations and warranties are qualified by a material adverse effect standard. For purposes of the Merger Agreement,
“material adverse effect,” with respect to either party, is defined to mean an event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition, circumstance or
occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. However, none of the following events, changes, effects,
developments, states of facts, conditions, circumstances or occurrences will be deemed to constitute or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been or may be a material adverse effect:
 

 
•  changes in or affecting general political or economic conditions (including changes in interest rates) or the financial, credit or securities

markets in the United States or elsewhere in the world, to the extent the applicable party and its subsidiaries are not adversely affected
thereby in a disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate;

 

 
•  changes in or conditions generally affecting the industries in which the applicable party or its subsidiaries operate (not including any

different industries in which such party’s or its subsidiaries’

to other participants in the industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate;

 

 
•  changes resulting from or arising out of the announcement or existence of, or compliance with, or taking any action required by the Merger

Agreement, the Merger or the issuance of shares of Kemper common stock in the Merger and the impact of any of the foregoing on any
relationships with policyholders, agents, suppliers, vendors, business partners, employees or regulators;

each case after the date of the Merger Agreement, of any rule, regulation, ordinance, order, protocol or any other law of or by any national,
regional, state or local governmental entity, to the extent the applicable party and its subsidiaries are not adversely affected thereby in a
disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate;

 

 

•  changes resulting from or arising out of any changes in the United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or statutory
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance regulators of the jurisdictions in which an applicable Infinity insurance
subsidiary is domiciled (“SAP”) or accounting standards or interpretations thereof, to the extent the applicable party and its subsidiaries are
not adversely affected thereby in a disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in which such party and its
subsidiaries operate;

 

 
•  changes resulting from or arising out of any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of war or terrorism, to the extent the applicable party

and its subsidiaries are not adversely affected thereby in a disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in which
such party and its subsidiaries operate;

thereby in a disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate;

by any shareholders or stockholders of the applicable party, against such party, any of its affiliates or any of their respective directors or
officers arising out of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the issuance of shares of Kemper common stock in the Merger; or

 

 

•  changes resulting from or arising out of any change in the share price or trading volume of the shares of the applicable party’s common
stock, in such party’s credit rating or in any analyst’s recommendations, in each case in and of itself, or the failure of such party to meet
projections or forecasts (including any analyst’s projections), in and of itself (provided, and without limiting the preceding clauses, that the
event, change, effect, development, condition, circumstance or occurrence underlying such change or failure will not be excluded, and may
be taken into account, in determining whether there has been or may be a material adverse effect).

Infinity Acquisition Proposals

Infinity has agreed that, except as described further below, neither it nor any of its respective subsidiaries will, and Infinity will cause its directors
and officers not to and will direct its and their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly induce or facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any inquiries or the

making of any proposal or offer constituting or related to an Infinity acquisition proposal (as defined below);

Infinity’s representatives acting in their capacity as such), in connection with or in response to an Infinity acquisition proposal;
 

 
•  engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any Infinity acquisition proposal (other than to state that they currently

are not permitted to have discussions);
 

 •  approve, endorse or recommend any Infinity acquisition proposal;
 

 •  make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Infinity acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any contract providing for, relating to or in connection with any Infinity
acquisition proposal (other than a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and, taken as a whole, no
less favorable to Infinity than those set forth in the confidentiality agreement (the “confidentiality agreement”), dated as of October 16,
2017 and as amended from time to time, by and between Infinity and Kemper (an “Infinity acceptable confidentiality agreement”); or

 

 
•  reimburse or agree to reimburse the expenses of any other person (other than Infinity’s representatives) in connection with an Infinity

acquisition proposal.

Infinity has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will, and has agreed to cause its directors and officers to and direct its and their respective
representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted with respect to
any Infinity acquisition proposal and (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously made available by it or on its
behalf in connection with any actual or potential Infinity acquisition proposal. Infinity has further agreed it will not terminate, waive, amend, release or
modify in any respect of any material provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Infinity or any of its subsidiaries or any of its
affiliates or representatives is a party with respect to any Infinity acquisition proposal and will enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the provisions of any such agreement. However, Infinity will be entitled to waive any standstill provision included in any such confidentiality agreement
or any standstill provision contained in any standstill agreement to which Infinity or any of its subsidiaries or any of its affiliates or representatives is a
party solely to permit any Infinity acquisition proposal if the Infinity Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Infinity’s outside legal
counsel) that failure to waive such standstill would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Infinity shareholders under applicable law.

However, prior to the Infinity shareholder approval, (i) if Infinity receives, after the date of the Merger Agreement, an unsolicited bona fide
written Infinity acquisition proposal, (ii) such Infinity acquisition proposal does not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and (iii) the Infinity
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Infinity’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that such Infinity acquisition
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Infinity superior proposal (as defined below), then, prior to obtaining the Infinity
shareholder approval, Infinity may (and may authorize and permit its subsidiaries and representatives to):
 

 

•  make available information with respect to Infinity or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Infinity acquisition proposal
pursuant to an Infinity acceptable confidentiality agreement; provided, that any non-public information provided or made available to any
person given such access will have been previously provided or made available to Kemper or will be provided or made available to Kemper
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such person; and

 

 
•  participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Infinity acquisition proposal regarding such Infinity acquisition

proposal.

outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that the applicable Infinity acquisition proposal ceases to be an Infinity superior proposal or an
Infinity acquisition proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Infinity superior proposal. However, Infinity and its representatives may in
any event have discussions with any person solely in order to (i) clarify and understand the terms and conditions of the Infinity acquisition proposal
made by such person and (ii) to request that any Infinity acquisition proposal made orally be made in writing.

Infinity is required to promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise Kemper in writing if it receives any Infinity acquisition proposal
(including the identity of the person making or submitting the Infinity acquisition proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer and the terms and conditions of
the Infinity acquisition proposal) that is made or submitted by any person prior to the effective time. Infinity is also required to keep Kemper informed,
on a reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any financial or other changes in, any Infinity acquisition proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer,
including providing Kemper copies of any correspondence related to an Infinity acquisition proposal and proposed documents to effect an Infinity
acquisition proposal (or a written summary of the material terms of such Infinity acquisition proposal, if not made in writing).

Infinity recommendation or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action, an “Infinity adverse recommendation
change”); or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any Infinity acquisition proposal or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions;

Infinity Articles or Infinity Regulations inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Infinity acquisition proposal (including
approving any transaction under the OGCL); or

 

 •  resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

An “Infinity acquisition proposal” means any proposal, inquiry, submission or offer (whether or not in writing) with respect to, or that is or would

Kemper has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will, and has agreed to cause its directors and officers to and direct its and their respective
representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted with respect to
any Kemper acquisition proposal and (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously made available by it or on
its behalf in connection with any actual or potential Kemper acquisition proposal. Kemper has further agreed it will not terminate, waive, amend, release
or modify in any respect any material provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Kemper or any of its subsidiaries or any of its
affiliates or representatives is a party with respect to any Kemper acquisition proposal and will enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the provisions of any such agreement. However, Kemper will be entitled to waive any standstill provision included in any such confidentiality
agreement or any standstill provision contained in any standstill agreement to which Kemper or any of its subsidiaries or any of its affiliates or
representatives is a party solely to permit any Kemper acquisition proposal if the Kemper Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
Kemper’s outside legal counsel) that failure to waive such standstill would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Kemper stockholders under
applicable law.

However, prior to the Kemper stockholder approval, (i) if Kemper receives, after the date of the Merger Agreement, an unsolicited bona fide
written Kemper acquisition proposal, (ii) such Kemper acquisition proposal does not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and (iii) the Kemper
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Kemper’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that such Kemper acquisition
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Kemper superior proposal (as defined below), then, prior to obtaining the Kemper
stockholder approval, Kemper may (and may authorize and permit its subsidiaries and representatives to):
 

 

•  make available information with respect to Kemper or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Kemper acquisition proposal
pursuant to a Kemper acceptable confidentiality agreement; provided, that any non-public information provided or made available to any
person given such access will have been previously provided or made available to Infinity or will be provided or made available to Infinity
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such person; and

 

 
•  participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Kemper acquisition proposal regarding such Kemper acquisition

proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kemper and its subsidiaries will, and will cause their subsidiaries and Kemper’s directors and officers to and will
direct Kemper’s representatives to, cease any activities described in the two bullet points above, immediately following the time that the Kemper Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with Kemper’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor) that the applicable Kemper acquisition
proposal ceases to be a Kemper superior proposal or a Kemper acquisition proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Kemper superior
proposal. However, Kemper and its representatives may in any event have discussions with any person solely in order to (i) clarify and understand the
terms and conditions of the Kemper acquisition proposal made by such person and (ii) to request that any Kemper acquisition proposal made orally be
made in writing.

Kemper is required to promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise Infinity in writing if it receives any Kemper acquisition proposal
(including the identity of the person making or submitting the Kemper acquisition proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer and the terms and conditions of
the Kemper acquisition proposal) that is made or submitted by any person prior to the effective time. Kemper is also required to keep Infinity informed,
on a reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any financial or other changes in, any Kemper acquisition proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer,
including providing Infinity copies of any correspondence related to a Kemper acquisition proposal and proposed documents to effect a Kemper
acquisition proposal (or a written summary of the material terms of such Kemper acquisition proposal, if not made in writing).

Special Meeting of Infinity Shareholders; Recommendation of the Infinity Board

Infinity has agreed to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of seeking the Infinity shareholder
approval as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than thirty (30) days) following the effectiveness of the Form S-4. Unless the Merger
Agreement has been terminated by Infinity to accept an Infinity superior proposal, this requirement to hold the Infinity shareholder meeting and seek
Infinity shareholder approval applies even if the Infinity Board has made an Infinity adverse recommendation change and even after the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or public or private communications to Infinity of any Infinity acquisition proposal. Except in certain specified
circumstances, Infinity has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure such approval, and the Infinity Board has agreed not to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify the Infinity recommendation in a manner adverse to Kemper.

Infinity will have the right to postpone or adjourn the meeting of its shareholders for no longer than 20 business days in the aggregate for the
following reasons:
 

 •  the absence of a quorum;
 

 
•  to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time, taking into account the amount of time until

the meeting of its shareholders, Infinity has not received a number of proxies that would reasonably be believed to be sufficient to obtain the
Infinity shareholder approval at such meeting of its shareholders; or

 

 •  with the prior written consent of Kemper.

The Merger Agreement provides that, at any time prior to the Infinity shareholder approval, provided that Infinity and its subsidiaries have
complied with the non-solicitation restrictions described above regarding Infinity acquisition proposals, the Infinity Board may, solely in response to an
Infinity superior proposal received on or after the date of the Merger Agreement that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a
breach of the Merger Agreement, make an Infinity adverse recommendation change in order to cause Infinity to terminate the Merger Agreement and
concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Infinity superior proposal if Infinity has taken the following actions and the Infinity
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Infinity’s outside legal counsel) that such Infinity acquisition proposal continues to constitute an
Infinity superior proposal:
 

 

•  Infinity has provided written notice to Kemper advising Kemper that Infinity received an Infinity superior proposal, identifying the person
making such Infinity superior proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Infinity superior proposal and providing copies of any
agreements intended to effect such Infinity superior proposal and that the Infinity Board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with Infinity’s outside legal counsel) that such Infinity acquisition proposal continues to constitute an Infinity superior proposal;

•  Infinity has negotiated and caused its representatives to negotiate during the four business days following Kemper’s receipt of the notice of
the Infinity superior proposal described above in good faith with Kemper to enable Kemper to make a counteroffer or propose to amend the
terms of the Merger Agreement (to the extent Kemper wishes to do so) so that such Infinity acquisition proposal no longer constitutes an
Infinity superior proposal; and

 

 
•  after complying with the previous two bullet points, Infinity has reaffirmed the Infinity Board’s determination described above in light of

any counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

However, if during the negotiation period described in the second bullet point above, any revisions are made to an Infinity acquisition proposal,
and such revisions are material (it being understood and agreed by Infinity and Kemper that any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is
material), Infinity will deliver a new written notice to Kemper and will comply with the requirements as described above with respect to the new notice
of the Infinity superior proposal, except that any subsequent negotiation period will be two (2) business days following Kemper’s receipt of the notice of
such Infinity superior proposal.

The Merger Agreement also provides that the Infinity Board may make an Infinity adverse recommendation change other than in circumstances
involving or relating to an Infinity superior proposal, but only in response to an Infinity intervening event (as defined below) if the Infinity Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with Infinity’s outside legal counsel) that failure to make an Infinity adverse recommendation change would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Infinity shareholders under applicable law and that:
 

 
•  Infinity has provided written notice to Kemper describing the Infinity intervening event and advising Kemper that the Infinity Board intends

to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail;
 

 
•  Infinity has negotiated and caused its representatives to negotiate during the four business days following Kemper’s receipt of the notice of

the Infinity intervening event in good faith with Kemper regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement proposed by Kemper in response to such Infinity intervening event; and

 

 

•  at the end of such four business day period, the Infinity Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Infinity’s outside legal
counsel (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Kemper) that the
Infinity intervening event continues to exist and that the failure to make an Infinity adverse recommendation change would constitute a
breach by the Infinity Board of its fiduciary duties to the Infinity shareholders under applicable law.

An “Infinity intervening event” means an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to Infinity and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, that is not known or reasonably foreseeable (or the consequences or magnitude of the consequences of which are not known or
reasonably foreseeable) to or by the Infinity Board on the date of the Merger Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence
(or the consequences or magnitude of the consequences thereof) becomes known by the Infinity Board prior to obtaining the Infinity shareholder
approval. However, if the Infinity intervening event relates to an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence involving Kemper or any of its
subsidiaries, then such event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence will not constitute an Infinity intervening event unless it has a material
adverse effect with respect to Kemper or, other than with respect to any of the consents, qualifications, approvals, clearances, orders, waivers or
exemptions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, it materially impairs the ability of the Kemper to perform its obligations under the Merger
Agreement or prevent or unreasonably delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, provided further that
none of the following constitutes an “Infinity intervening event” for purposes of the Merger Agreement: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of an Infinity
acquisition proposal or any inquiry or matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (ii) events or circumstances arising from the announcement or the
existence of, or any action taken by

therewith; and (iii) changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of Infinity common stock or shares of Kemper common stock (it being
understood that the facts and occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such changes may be taken into account in determining whether there has been
an Infinity intervening event).

In addition, nothing in the Merger Agreement prohibits the Infinity Board from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its shareholders if the
Infinity Board determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of Infinity under applicable law, provided that neither Infinity nor the Infinity Board (or any committee thereof) will be permitted to
recommend that the Infinity shareholders tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or
recommend any Infinity acquisition proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the Infinity Board effects an Infinity adverse
recommendation change in accordance with the requirements described above, and provided further that any such disclosure (other than a “stop, look
and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) will be deemed to be an
Infinity adverse recommendation change unless the Infinity Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Infinity recommendation and rejects any Infinity
acquisition proposal within the later of (i) three (3) business days after such “stop, look and listen” communication and (ii) if applicable, the deadline for
filing a Schedule 14D-9 with respect to such Infinity acquisition proposal with the SEC.

Annual Meeting of Kemper Stockholders; Recommendation of the Kemper Board

specified circumstances, Kemper has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the share issuance proposal and to take all

necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to carry out the Merger Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement will obligate Kemper or any of its subsidiaries to, and neither Infinity nor any of
its subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of Kemper, (which consent will be in the sole discretion of Kemper), in connection with the
actions contemplated by clauses (ii) and (iv) above, agree to any modification to or accommodation under any contract or pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for or relating to any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

Each of Infinity and Kemper has agreed to make, if required, appropriate filings and registrations under any regulatory law and insurance law,
including a filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
within a reasonable time period not to exceed 15 days from the date of the Merger Agreement and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and

use certain efforts referenced above, to the extent relating to the requisite approvals, authorizations and clearances for the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement under the HSR Act or any other regulatory law and insurance law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any legal action or
proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), any insurance regulator or any
other governmental entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any legal action or proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) permit the other a reasonable opportunity to review any substantive
written communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting, discussion or conference with, the
FTC, the DOJ, any insurance regulator or any other governmental entity or, in connection with any legal action or proceeding by a private party, with
any other person, and, to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, such insurance regulator or such other applicable governmental entity or other
person, as applicable, give the other the reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, discussions and conferences and (iv) to the
extent practicable and subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, attempt to confer in good faith in order to (A) exchange and review respective
views and positions with the other as to potential materially burdensome conditions and (B) discuss and present to, and engage with, the applicable
governmental entity regarding any approaches or actions that could mitigate the scope or impact of a potential materially burdensome condition so that it
does not become a materially burdensome condition. Kemper and Infinity will promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication, including
promptly furnishing each other copies of any written or electronic communication, and will promptly advise each other when any such communication

causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite approval, authorization or clearance for the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement under the HSR Act or any requisite regulatory approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval,
authorization or clearance or requisite regulatory approval will be materially delayed or conditioned or impose or require a materially burdensome
condition. Kemper and Infinity will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or
submitted by or on behalf of Kemper and Infinity, as applicable, including reasonable access to any materials submitted in connection with any
proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other applicable regulatory law.

However, (i) Kemper will have final approval over all matters pertaining to any legal action or proceeding, meeting, discussion, conference or
response in connection with the HSR Act and any requisite regulatory approval and (ii) Infinity and Kemper may, as each deems advisable and
necessary (after consultation with Infinity’s or Kemper’s outside legal counsel, as applicable), reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other side in connection with the foregoing as “competitively sensitive information.” Such materials and the information contained in
such materials will be given only to certain designated reviewers and will be treated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the confidentiality
agreement, which is supplemented by an addendum establishing “clean teams” and setting forth terms of their governance.

Without limiting the obligations of Kemper described above or provided in the Merger Agreement, Kemper will use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and use reasonable best efforts to take any and all action necessary to ensure that each requisite approval,
authorization or clearance under the HSR Act and each requisite regulatory approval is obtained by the November 13, 2018 (or if extended by the terms
of the Merger Agreement, February 13, 2019), in each case, without imposing or requiring a materially burdensome condition.

None of Kemper or any of its subsidiaries will be obligated to, and neither Infinity nor any of its subsidiaries will, without the prior written
consent of Kemper, consent to, take or refrain from taking, or offer or commit or consent to take or refrain from taking (i) any action that involves
(A) making any divestiture or disposition of any portion of any business or assets, (B) licensing any portion of any business or assets, (C) accepting or
entering any consent decree or hold separate order or (D) placing any assets in trust, in each case by Kemper, Infinity or any their respective or affiliates,
in each case except for such actions related to de minimis assets (with such assets measured on a scale relative to Infinity and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole), (ii) any action that involves (A) accepting or entering into any operational restriction or restriction on the payment or declaration of dividends,
(B) making any capital commitment or capital guaranty or (C) entering into any capital support agreement, statement of support, guarantee, keep well or
other similar capital maintenance undertaking to maintain a minimum risk-based capital level or rating, in each case with respect to, or in connection
with, Kemper, Infinity or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates which, in each case and together with any other such action, would or would
reasonably be expected to detract from the benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Kemper and its subsidiaries as a result of the Merger (with
such benefits measured on a scale relative to Infinity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and to include Kemper’s ability to operate its business after
giving effect to the Merger), or (iii) any action that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect with respect to either Kemper or
Infinity, after giving effect to the Merger (with such materiality measured on a scale relative to Infinity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), in each
case of the immediately foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), whether before or after the closing (any such action, a “materially burdensome condition”).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above or in the Merger Agreement, in no event will Kemper, Infinity or any of their affiliates
be required by a governmental entity to agree to take, or enter into any action, which action is not conditioned upon the closing.

Restrictions on Kemper’s Interim Operations

Kemper has agreed that, except with the prior written consent of Infinity (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and except as expressly required or permitted by the Merger Agreement or by any financing arrangements entered into by Kemper or any of its
subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or required by law, prior to the effective time or the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement, as the
case may be, it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to conduct its business and the business of its subsidiaries in
the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as previously conducted and, to the extent consistent therewith, use, and cause
each of its subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to preserve substantially intact the business organization of Kemper and its subsidiaries and
goodwill associated therewith.

Kemper has further agreed not to take certain actions prior to the effective time or the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement, as the case
may be, without the written consent of Infinity (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) subject to certain delineated
exceptions included in the disclosure letter delivered to Infinity by Kemper in connection with the Merger, unless the actions are expressly required or
permitted by the Merger Agreement. In particular, subject to the above exceptions, Kemper will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to:
 

 

•  amend or permit the adoption of any amendment (whether by merger, amalgamation, scheme of arrangement, consolidation or otherwise) to
the charter or bylaws of Kemper in a manner that would adversely affect the closing or affect, following the effective time, the holders of
shares of Infinity common stock whose shares may be converted into shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in
a manner different than holders of shares of Kemper common stock prior to the effective time;

 

 

•  adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization,
except for any merger or consolidation solely among wholly owned subsidiaries of Kemper not in violation of any instrument binding on
Kemper or any of its subsidiaries and that would not reasonably be expected to result in a material increase in the net tax liability of Kemper
or any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and would not present a material risk of any delay in the receipt of any approvals required for the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 

 

•  issue, grant, deliver, sell, pledge, dispose of or encumber any (i) shares of capital stock, (ii) voting debt or other voting securities of Kemper,

of its capital stock or other equity interests, other than (i) any dividend or distribution by any of its subsidiaries to Kemper or to another
wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper and (ii) regular quarterly dividends in an amount per share of Kemper common stock no greater than
the quarterly dividend declared and to be paid by Kemper during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, with record and payment dates in
accordance with Kemper’s customary dividend schedule;

 

 

•  adjust, split or combine any shares of its capital stock or other equity interests (except in connection with the cashless exercises or similar
transactions (including withholding of taxes) pursuant to the vesting or exercise, as the case may be, of Kemper stock awards or other equity
awards of Kemper outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement or issued pursuant to Kemper’s stock plans), or reclassify, combine,
split, subdivide or otherwise amend the terms of its capital stock or other equity interests, or enter into any agreement with respect to the
voting of any of Kemper’s capital stock, in each case in a manner that would adversely affect the closing or affect, following the effective
time, the holders of shares of Infinity common stock whose shares may be converted into shares of Kemper common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement in a manner different than holders of shares of Kemper common stock immediately prior to the effective time; or

 

 •  agree to take, authorize, enter into any contract obligating it to take, or commit to take any of the above actions.

Employee Benefit Matters

Following the effective time, Kemper has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee of Infinity and its subsidiaries
that is continuing with Kemper and its subsidiaries to be provided full credit for prior service with Infinity and its subsidiaries for purposes of
(i) eligibility and vesting under applicable Kemper employee benefit plans (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit plan or for
purposes of determining eligibility for retiree health and welfare benefits) and (ii) determination of vacation or severance benefit levels.

No continuing employee will be retroactively eligible for any Kemper employee benefit plan, including any plan that was frozen prior to the
effective time. In addition, Kemper generally will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing
conditions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods and similar exclusions; and (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by continuing
employees and their dependents prior to the effective time to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying all deductibles, copayments, maximum
out-of-pocket requirements and similar expenses applicable under the comparable Kemper employee benefit plan during the calendar year in which the
closing date occurs.

For any individual whose employment is terminated by Kemper or Infinity during the 12 month period immediately following the effective time
(but not including any individual who has entered into an individualized severance agreement), Kemper or Infinity, as applicable, will provide severance
benefits that are determined and payable in accordance with the severance benefit plan maintained for similarly situated employees of Infinity at the
effective time, taking into account all service with Infinity in determining the amount of severance benefits payable.

Until the effective time or the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement, as the case may be, Infinity has agreed that it will use its best
efforts to retain and (subject to Kemper’s consent) replace certain specified key employees when their employment is terminated.

Board of Directors of Kemper After the Merger

Kemper has agreed to take all actions necessary to cause, as of the effective time, the election as a member to the Kemper Board of one individual
who is serving as a director of Infinity as of the date the Merger

Find More Information” beginning on page 279.

administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that such person is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of
Infinity or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to the effective time (provided that such person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if
and only to the extent required by applicable law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
person is not entitled to indemnification for such expenses). No such person will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual legal action or proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by a person described above unless Kemper consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Kemper has also agreed that it will cause the surviving corporation to, and the surviving corporation will, for a period of no less than six years
following the effective time, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other comparable organization documents of Infinity and its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement or
in any indemnification agreements of Infinity or its subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any individuals who immediately before the effective time were current or former directors, officers or employees of Infinity or its subsidiaries,
provided that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any legal action or proceeding pending or asserted or
any claim made within such period will continue until the final disposition of such legal action or proceeding.

Kemper is required to, in its sole discretion, either (i) provide, or cause Infinity to provide, following the effective time, Infinity’s current directors
and officers an insurance and indemnification policy or (ii) obtain, at or prior to the effective time, so long as it does not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time, prepaid (or “tail”) directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies
that, in either case, provide coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time for an aggregate period of not less than six years from the effective
time that are no less favorable in the aggregate (with respect to limits and deductibles) to Infinity’s existing policy or policies or, if such insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available similar coverage, so long as the annual premium for the insurance does not exceed 300% of the last annual
premium that Infinity paid prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. If the premium of such insurance exceeds the 300% limitation described above,
Kemper will cause to be maintained policies of such insurance which, in Kemper’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
with an annual premium equal to 300% of Infinity’s current annual premium.

If Kemper, the surviving corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets, then,
and in each case, Kemper and the surviving corporation will ensure that such surviving entity or the transferees of such properties or assets assume the
indemnification and insurance obligations described above.

The rights of each such person described above will be in addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of Infinity and its subsidiaries or under any agreement of any such person with Infinity or any of
its subsidiaries, in each case in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or under applicable law. The rights described above will survive the
closing in accordance with their terms and are intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by, each such person described above.

APPRAISAL AND DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS

Kemper Stockholders

Under the DGCL, Kemper stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the issuance of shares of Kemper common stock to
Infinity shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. It is expected that Kemper common stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE during the
pendency of the Merger and following the effective time, and Kemper’s corporate status will not change as a result of the Merger because the Merger is
being completed between Vulcan Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper, and Infinity.

Infinity Shareholders

If the merger proposal is approved, each Infinity shareholder who does not vote in favor of the merger proposal may be entitled to seek relief as a
dissenting Infinity shareholder under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. The following is a summary of the principal steps a shareholder must take to perfect
dissenters’ rights under the OGCL. This summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, which is attached as
Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. Any Infinity shareholder
considering the exercise of dissenters’ rights is urged to review carefully the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and to consult an attorney in
connection therewith, since failure to follow fully and precisely the procedural requirements of the statute may result in termination or waiver of such
rights.

To perfect dissenters’ rights, a dissenting Infinity shareholder must satisfy each of the following conditions and must otherwise comply with
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL:
 

 

•  a dissenting Infinity shareholder must be a record holder of the shares of Infinity common stock as to which such shareholder seeks to
exercise dissenters’ rights on the Infinity record date. Because only Infinity shareholders of record on the Infinity record date may exercise
dissenters’ rights, any person or entity who beneficially owns shares that are held of record by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder
of record who desires to exercise dissenters’ rights must, in all cases, instruct such bank, broker, trust or other nominee holder of record to
comply with and satisfy all of the requirements of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL;

 

 

•  a dissenting Infinity shareholder must not vote his or her shares in favor of the merger proposal at the Infinity special meeting. Failing to
vote or abstaining from voting does not waive a dissenting shareholder’s dissenters’ rights. However, a signed proxy returned to Infinity
without specified voting instructions will be voted in favor of the merger proposal and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters’ rights. A
dissenting Infinity shareholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before its exercise by filing with Infinity an instrument revoking it,
delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, voting by telephone or over the Internet at a later date than the date of the previous
proxy or by attending and giving notice of the revocation of the proxy at the Infinity special meeting (see “The Infinity Special Meeting—
Voting; Proxies; Revocation” beginning on page 55);

 

 

•  a dissenting Infinity shareholder must deliver a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of the shares of Infinity common stock
held by such shareholder prior to the vote by Infinity shareholders on the merger proposal at the Infinity special meeting (a “written
demand”). Any written demand must specify the dissenting Infinity shareholder’s name and address, the number and class of shares held by
the shareholder on the Infinity record date (the “dissenting shares”), and the amount claimed as the fair cash value of the dissenting shares.
Voting against the merger proposal does not constitute the written demand required under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; and

 

 
•  with respect to shares of Infinity common stock represented by share certificates, if Infinity sends to a dissenting Infinity shareholder, at the

address specified in the written demand, a request for the share certificates representing the dissenting shares, the dissenting Infinity
shareholder, within fifteen

(15) days from the date of Infinity sending such request, must deliver to Infinity the share certificates requested so that Infinity may endorse
on them a legend to the effect that demand for the fair cash value of such shares has been made. Such a request is not an admission by
Infinity that a dissenting Infinity shareholder is entitled to relief under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Infinity will promptly return the
endorsed share certificates to the dissenting Infinity shareholder. At the option of Infinity, a dissenting Infinity shareholder who fails to
deliver the share certificates representing the dissenting shares after receiving such request from Infinity shall have his or her dissenters’
rights terminated upon Infinity delivering written notice to such dissenting shareholder within twenty (20) days after the lapse of the fifteen
(15)-day period, unless a court for good cause shown otherwise directs.

Infinity and a dissenting Infinity shareholder may come to an agreement as to the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. If Infinity and the
dissenting Infinity shareholder cannot agree upon the fair cash value of the dissenting shares, then either Infinity or the dissenting Infinity shareholder
may, within three (3) months after service of a written demand by the dissenting Infinity shareholder, file a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of
Hamilton County, Ohio (the “Court”), for a determination that the dissenting Infinity shareholder is entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights and to
determine the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. If the Court finds the dissenting Infinity shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any
dissenting shares, the Court may appoint one or more appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the amount of the fair cash value.
The Court will then make a finding as to the fair cash value of the dissenting shares and shall render judgment against Infinity for the payment of such
fair cash value, with interest at a rate and from a date as the Court considers equitable. The costs of the proceeding, including reasonable compensation
to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, will be assessed or apportioned as the court considers equitable.

Fair cash value for purposes of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL is the amount that a willing seller who is under no compulsion to sell would be
willing to accept and that a willing buyer, under no compulsion to purchase, would be willing to pay, but in no event may the fair cash value exceed the
amount specified in the written demand of a dissenting Infinity shareholder. The fair cash value is to be determined as of the day prior to the date of the
Infinity special meeting. For purposes of determining the fair cash value of a share listed on a national securities exchange (such as the NASDAQ, on
which shares of Infinity common stock are currently listed) immediately before the effective time of the Merger, fair cash value of a share will be the
closing sale price of Infinity common stock on the NASDAQ the day before the Infinity shareholders vote on the merger proposal (which date will be
the day before the Infinity special meeting unless the Infinity special meeting is adjourned or postponed). Otherwise, any appreciation or depreciation in
the market value of Infinity common stock resulting from the Merger, and any premium associated with control of Infinity, or any discount for lack of
marketability or minority status, will be excluded. The fair cash value may be higher, the same as, or lower than the per share value of the Merger
Consideration to be received by Infinity shareholders in connection with the Merger. Infinity shareholders should be aware that an investment banking
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to,
and does not otherwise address, “fair cash value” under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL.

Payment of the fair cash value must be made within thirty (30) days after the later of the final determination of such value or the effective time. In
the case of holders of shares of Infinity common stock represented by share certificates, such payment shall be made only upon simultaneous surrender
to Infinity of the dissenting Infinity shareholder’s share certificates for which such payment is made.

Pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, a dissenting Infinity shareholder’s rights to receive the fair cash value of the dissenting shares will
automatically terminate if:
 

 •  the dissenting Infinity shareholder has not complied with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL;
 

 
•  the Merger is abandoned or is finally enjoined or prevented from being carried out, or the Infinity shareholders rescind their approval of the

merger proposal;

 •  the dissenting Infinity shareholder withdraws such shareholder’s written demand, with the consent of the Infinity Board; or
 

 
•  the dissenting Infinity shareholder and the Infinity Board have not agreed on the fair cash value of Infinity common stock and neither has

filed a timely complaint in the Court within three (3) months after the dissenting Infinity shareholder delivered a written demand.

All rights accruing to holders of shares of Infinity common stock, including voting and dividend or distribution rights, are suspended from the
time a dissenting Infinity shareholder submits a written demand with respect to any dissenting shares until the termination or satisfaction of the rights
and obligations of the dissenting Infinity shareholder and Infinity arising from the written demand. During this period of suspension, any dividend or
distribution paid on the dissenting shares will be paid to the record owner as a credit upon the fair cash value thereof. If an Infinity shareholder’s
dissenters’ rights are terminated other than by purchase of the dissenting shares by Infinity, then at the time of termination all rights will be restored and
all distributions that would have been made, but for suspension, will be made.

DESCRIPTION OF KEMPER CAPITAL STOCK

The following summary is a description of the material terms of Kemper’s capital stock and is not complete. You should also refer to the Kemper
Charter and Kemper Bylaws, which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part,
and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279. The description set forth below
should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders and Infinity Shareholders” beginning on page
241.

The Kemper Charter authorizes Kemper to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share, and 20,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share. Currently, there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding, although Kemper may issue preferred stock in
the future. Kemper common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “KMPR.” Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the registrar and transfer
agent for Kemper common stock.

Common Stock

All of Kemper’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of Kemper common stock to be issued by Kemper to Infinity
shareholders in connection with the Merger will be, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Voting

Each holder of shares of Kemper common stock is entitled to attend all special and annual meetings of the Kemper stockholders. Kemper
stockholders have one vote for each share held on all matters voted upon by the Kemper stockholders, including the election of directors to the Kemper
Board. Other than the election of directors, if an action is to be taken by vote of Kemper’s stockholders at a meeting of Kemper’s stockholders at which
a quorum is present, it will be decided by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such matter, unless a different vote is required under the Kemper
Charter or the DGCL. In an election of directors at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present, a nominee for director shall be elected to the
Kemper Board if the votes cast for such nominee’s election exceed the votes cast against such nominee’s election, provided, however, in the event the
number of nominees for director is greater than the number of directors to be elected, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast.

Dividends

Except for any preferential rights of holders of any preferred stock that may then be issued and outstanding and any other class or series of stock
having a preference over the Kemper common stock, holders of Kemper common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the
Kemper Board, from legally available funds. For additional information, see “The Merger—Kemper’s Dividend Policy” on page 164.

Liquidation Rights

In the event of Kemper’s liquidation or dissolution, the holders of Kemper common stock are entitled to receive ratably all assets available for
distribution to stockholders after the payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock.

Other Rights

Holders of Kemper common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. The rights, preferences and privileges of
holders of Kemper common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that
Kemper may designate and issue in the future.

Preferred Stock

The Kemper Charter authorizes the Kemper Board to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, with such distinctive
designation or title and in such number of shares as may be authorized by the Kemper Board. The Kemper Board is authorized to prescribe the
designations, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of any series
so established, including but not limited to the following: (i) the voting powers, full, special, or limited, or no voting powers, of each such series; (ii) the
rate, terms and conditions on which dividends will be paid, whether such dividends will be cumulative, and what preference such dividends shall have in
relation to the dividends on other series or classes of stock; (iii) the rights, terms and conditions, if any, for conversion of such series of preferred stock
into shares of other series or classes of stock; (iv) any right of Kemper to redeem the shares of such series of preferred stock, and the price, time, and
conditions of such redemption, including the provisions for any sinking fund; and (v) the rights of holders of such series of preferred stock in relation to
the rights of other series and classes of stock upon the liquidation, dissolution or distribution of Kemper’s assets. Unless otherwise provided by the
Kemper Board, upon redemption or conversion, shares of preferred stock will revert to authorized but unissued shares and may be reissued as shares of
any series of preferred stock.

Certain Statutory, Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws Provisions Affecting Stockholders

Various provisions of the Kemper Charter, Kemper Bylaws, the DGCL and state insurance laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
discouraging another party from acquiring control of Kemper. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive
takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage, or could have the effect of encouraging, persons
seeking to acquire control of Kemper to first negotiate with the Kemper Board.

The portions of the summary set forth below describing certain provisions of the Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the provisions of the Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws, copies of which are included as exhibits to the registration statement
of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 279.

Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaw Provisions

Special Meetings of Stockholders. The Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws do not grant the Kemper stockholders the right to call a special
meeting of stockholders. Under the Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws, special meetings of Kemper stockholders may be called only by the Chairman
of the Kemper Board or by a majority of the directors of the Kemper Board then in office.

No Stockholder Action by Written Consent. The Kemper Charter also provides that stockholders may not take any action by written consent.

Advance Notice Requirements. The Kemper Bylaws set forth advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the
nomination of candidates for election as directors or other business to be presented at meetings of stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of
such stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the Secretary of Kemper prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally,
to be timely, notice must be delivered to the Secretary of Kemper at the principal executive offices of Kemper not less than sixty (60) nor more than
ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. The notice must contain specified information concerning the person to
be nominated or the business to be brought before the meeting and concerning the stockholder submitting the proposal. The advance notice requirement
does not give the Kemper Board any power to approve or disapprove stockholder director nominations or proposals but may have the effect of
precluding the consideration of such nominations or proposals at a meeting if the proper notice procedures are not followed.

Table of Contents

Blank Check Preferred Stock. Kemper’s preferred stock could be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect in that, if a hostile takeover situation
should arise, shares of Kemper preferred stock could be issued to purchasers sympathetic with Kemper’s management or others in such a way as to
render more difficult or to discourage a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of Kemper’s securities
or the removal of incumbent management.

The effects of the issuance of one or more series of the preferred stock on the holders of Kemper common stock could include:
 

 
•  reduction of the amount otherwise available for payments of dividends on common stock if dividends are payable on the series of preferred

stock;
 

 •  restrictions on dividends on Kemper common stock if dividends on the series of preferred stock are in arrears;
 

 
•  dilution of the voting power of Kemper common stock if the series of preferred stock has voting rights, including a possible “veto” power if

the series of preferred stock has class voting rights;
 

 
•  dilution of the equity interest of holders of Kemper common stock if the series of preferred stock is convertible, and is converted, into

Kemper common stock; and
 

 
•  restrictions on the rights of holders of Kemper common stock to share in Kemper’s assets upon liquidation until satisfaction of any

liquidation preference granted to the holders of the series of preferred stock.

Business Combinations. Article Seven of the Kemper Charter places certain restrictions on the following transactions, subject to certain
exceptions, with a direct or indirect beneficial owner (including certain affiliates and former beneficial owners and successors to such beneficial owners)
of more than 15% of the voting power of Kemper’s outstanding voting stock (an “Interested Stockholder”):
 

 
•  any merger or consolidation of Kemper or any subsidiary with any Interested Stockholder or any other person (whether or not itself an

Interested Stockholder) which is, or after such merger or consolidation would be, an affiliate of an Interested Stockholder;
 

 
•  any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any

Interested Stockholder or any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder of any assets of Kemper or any subsidiary having an aggregate fair
market value of $10,000,000 or more;

 

 
•  the issuance or transfer by Kemper or any subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities of Kemper or any

subsidiary to any Interested Stockholder or any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder in exchange for cash, securities or other property (or a
combination thereof) having an aggregate fair market value of $10,000,000 or more;

 

 
•  the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Kemper proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Stockholder or

any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder; or
 

 

•  any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split or recapitalization of Kemper) or any merger or consolidation of Kemper
with any of its subsidiaries or any other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving any Interested Stockholder) which
has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible
securities of Kemper or any subsidiary beneficially owned by any Interested Stockholder or any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder.

Kemper may only enter into one of the transactions described above if:
 

 
•  the transaction has been approved by a majority of Kemper’s “continuing directors,” being (i) members of Kemper’s original board of

directors, (ii) persons unaffiliated with an Interested Stockholder who

Table of Contents

 
were members of the Kemper Board prior to such person or entity becoming an Interested Stockholder or (iii) successors of continuing
directors who were recommended to succeed continuing directors by a majority of continuing directors then on the Kemper Board; or

 

 

•  (i) the transaction has been approved by the affirmative vote of 75% of the voting power of Kemper’s outstanding voting stock, voting
together as a single class, (ii) the consideration to be received by the holders of each class or series of Kemper’s capital stock is not less than
the highest price paid by the Interested Stockholder for any shares of such class or series during the preceding 24 months and (iii) is either in
cash or in the form of consideration previously used by the Interested Stockholder to acquire the largest number of shares of such class or
series previously acquired by such Interested Stockholder, and certain other conditions have been met.

Exclusive Forum Provision. The Kemper Bylaws provide that, unless Kemper consents to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and
exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on Kemper’s behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty
owed to Kemper or Kemper’s stockholders by any of Kemper’s directors, officers or other employees, (iii) any action asserting a claim against Kemper
or any of Kemper’s directors or officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Kemper Charter or Kemper Bylaws or
(iv) any action asserting a claim against Kemper or any of Kemper’s directors or officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine,
shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another court of the State of Delaware
or, if no court of the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having
personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.

Business Combination Statute

Kemper is a Delaware corporation and consequently is also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions,
Section 203 of the DGCL prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder”
for three (3) years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the
approval of the corporation’s board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination,” in
reference to Kemper, includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation of Kemper or one of its subsidiaries and an interested stockholder or the
sale by Kemper or any of its subsidiaries to an interested stockholder of assets having an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of either the
aggregate market value of Kemper’s consolidated assets or the aggregate market value of Kemper’s outstanding stock. In general, in relation to Kemper,
an “interested stockholder” is any person that is the owner of 15% or more of Kemper’s outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of such
person. Section 203 of the DGCL makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a
three-year period. This statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts not approved in advance by the Kemper
Board, and as a result could discourage attempts to acquire Kemper, which could depress the market price of Kemper common stock.

Change in Control Requirements Under Insurance Laws

State insurance laws impose requirements that must be met prior to a change of control of an insurance company or an entity that controls an
insurance company; such laws will apply with respect to any state in which a controlled insurance company is domiciled or deemed “commercially
domiciled” (based on the level of business conducted in the subject state). Kemper has insurance company subsidiaries domiciled, or deemed
commercially domiciled, in Alabama, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin, which means that
any change of control of Kemper will be subject to the change of control statutes and related regulations in each of these states. Under the insurance
laws of these states, “control” is generally defined as the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is

Table of Contents

presumed to exist through the ownership of 10% (5% in Alabama) or more of the voting securities of a subject entity. Consequently, any person who
seeks to acquire Kemper voting securities that would result in such ownership level will be required to comply with the change of control regime in each
of the aforementioned states, which may include the advance filing of specific comprehensive information with the state insurance regulators, including
personal biographical and financial information, a public hearing on the filing, and the review and approval of the change of control by such regulators.

Many state statutes also require pre-acquisition notification to state insurance regulators of a change of control of a non-domestic insurance
company licensed in the state if specific market concentration thresholds would be triggered by the acquisition. Such statutes authorize the issuance of a
cease and desist order or other action with respect to the subject insurance company if certain conditions, such as undue market concentration, would
result from the acquisition.

All of the foregoing regulatory requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting control of Kemper or its insurance company
subsidiaries, or the ownership of Kemper’s voting securities, including transactions that could be advantageous to Kemper’s stockholders. Similarly,
such requirements may dissuade certain investors from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in Kemper or purchase Kemper common stock, which
could depress the market price of Kemper common stock.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF KEMPER STOCKHOLDERS AND INFINITY SHAREHOLDERS

The rights of Kemper stockholders are currently governed by the DGCL, the Kemper Charter and the Kemper Bylaws. The rights of the Infinity
shareholders are currently governed by the OGCL, the Infinity Articles and the Infinity Regulations. Upon the closing, each share of Infinity common
stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity
or any of its subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares under Ohio law) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the Merger Consideration, which will include shares of
Kemper common stock and/or cash, depending on the election of each Infinity shareholder. Following closing, the rights of the former Infinity
shareholders will be governed by the DGCL, the Kemper Charter and the Kemper Bylaws.

The following summary is a discussion of the material differences of the current rights of Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders. This
summary does not purport to be a complete statement of all differences, or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to in this summary,
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL, OGCL, Kemper Charter, Kemper Bylaws, Infinity Articles and Infinity Regulations. In
addition, the identification of some of the differences in the rights of Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders as material is not intended to
indicate or suggest that other differences are not equally material or do not exist. Kemper and Infinity urge you to read carefully this entire joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the OGCL, and the other documents to which Kemper and Infinity refer in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete understanding of the differences between the rights of Kemper stockholders and Infinity shareholders.
Kemper and Infinity have filed with the SEC their respective governing documents referenced in this summary comparison and will send copies of these
documents to you, without charge, upon your request. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 279. In addition, the Kemper
Charter and Kemper Bylaws are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part.

share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.10 per share.

The Kemper Board is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series, with such distinctive designation or
title and in such number of shares as may be authorized by the Kemper Board. The Kemper Board is authorized to prescribe the designations, powers,
preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of any series so established,
including but not limited to the following: (i) the voting powers, full, special, or limited, or no voting powers, of each such series; (ii) the rate, terms and
conditions on which dividends will be paid, whether such dividends will be cumulative, and what preference such dividends shall have in relation to the
dividends on other series or classes of stock; (iii) the rights, terms and conditions, if any, for conversion of such series of preferred stock into shares of
other series or classes of stock; (iv) any right of Kemper to redeem the shares of such series of preferred stock, and the price, time, and conditions of
such redemption, including the provisions for any sinking fund; and (v) the rights of holders of such series of preferred stock in relation to the rights of
other series and classes of stock upon the liquidation, dissolution or distribution of Kemper’s assets. Unless otherwise provided by the Kemper Board,
upon redemption or conversion, shares of preferred stock will revert to authorized but unissued shares and may be reissued as shares of any series of
preferred stock.

Infinity

The Infinity Articles authorize the issuance of 60,000,000 shares, consisting of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share, and

The Infinity Board is authorized to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to determine and fix prior to the issuance
thereof, the voting rights, dividend or distribution rights or entitlements, dividend or distribution rate or rates, dividend or distribution payment date or
dates, redemption rights and price, sinking fund requirements, conversion or exchange rights and restrictions on issuance of shares of such series, to the
fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Ohio. Before issuing any series of preferred stock, the Infinity Board will adopt
resolutions creating and designating the series as a series of preferred stock, and the resolutions will be filed in a statement with respect to shares as an
amendment to the Infinity Articles.

Voting

Kemper

Under the DGCL and the Kemper Bylaws, each holder of Kemper common stock is entitled to one (1) vote per share of Kemper common stock.

Infinity

Each holder of Infinity common stock entitled to vote on a proposal at a meeting of Infinity shareholders shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on
each proposal submitted to the meeting for each share held on the applicable record date. Infinity shareholders also have the right to cumulate their votes
in the election of directors. See “Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders and Infinity Shareholders—Election of Directors.”

Special Meetings of Stockholders and Shareholders

Kemper

The Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws do not grant stockholders the right to call a special meeting of stockholders. Under the Kemper Charter
and Kemper Bylaws, special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Kemper Board or by a majority of directors then in
office.

Infinity

The Infinity Regulations provide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Infinity Board, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President, a majority of directors or shareholders entitled to exercise fifty percent (50%) of all voting power of Infinity.

Stockholder and Shareholder Action by Written Consent

Kemper

The Kemper Charter expressly prohibits stockholder action by written consent.

Infinity

The OGCL provides that, unless otherwise prohibited by a corporation’s organizational documents, any action that may be taken by shareholders
of an Ohio corporation at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting with the unanimous written consent of all shareholders entitled to
vote at such meeting.

The Infinity Articles and Infinity Regulations do no prohibit shareholder action by written consent and, as a result, the relevant provisions of the
OGCL govern.

Stockholder and Shareholder Vote Requirements

Kemper

Under the Kemper Bylaws, any matter to be decided by Kemper stockholders other than the election of directors shall be decided by the majority
of votes cast with respect to such matter (with abstentions and “broker non-votes” not counted as a vote cast either “FOR” or “AGAINST” such matter),
unless a different vote is required by the DGCL, the Kemper Charter or the Kemper Bylaws.

For the vote required to elect directors to the Kemper Board, see “Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders And Infinity Shareholders—

The Infinity Regulations provide that, at any meeting at which a quorum is present, all business which may properly come before an Infinity
meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes cast, except when a greater proportion is required by law, the Infinity Articles or the Infinity
Regulations; provided, however, that no action required by law, the Infinity Articles or the Infinity Regulations to be authorized or taken by the holders
of a designated proportion of the shares or voting power of Infinity may be authorized or taken by a lesser proportion. Abstentions and “broker non-
votes” are not counted as a vote cast either “FOR” or “AGAINST” such matter.

Stockholder and Shareholder Proposals; Nomination of Candidates for Election to the Board of Directors

Kemper

The Kemper Bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the Kemper Board and the proposal of business to be considered by
stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders by any stockholder of record if such stockholder is entitled to vote at the meeting and
complies with the procedural requirements contained in the Kemper Bylaws.

The Kemper Bylaws set forth advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of persons for election as
directors or other business to be considered by stockholders at meetings of Kemper stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of such
stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the Secretary of Kemper prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. To be timely,
notice must be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of Kemper not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the
anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed by
more than sixty (60) days from such anniversary date, notice must be delivered to the secretary not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which a “public announcement” (as defined in the Kemper Bylaws) of the date of such meeting is first made.

Table of Contents

Bylaws. The advance notice requirement does not give the Kemper Board any power to approve or disapprove stockholder director nominations or
proposals but may have the effect of precluding the consideration of such nominations or proposals at a meeting if the proper notice procedures are not
followed.

Infinity

The Infinity Regulations provide that shareholder proposals regarding the nomination of candidates for election as directors and the proposal of
other business may be made by Infinity shareholders before annual meetings and special meetings, but in the case of special meetings if, and only if, the
notice of a special meeting provides for business to be brought before the meeting by shareholders. For shareholder proposals to be properly brought
before any meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of Infinity.

Annual Meeting Notice. To be timely, a shareholder proposal to be presented at an annual meeting shall be received by the secretary at Infinity’s
principal executive offices not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date that Infinity’s proxy statement was released to
shareholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of shareholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the
date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) calendar days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy
statement, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which
such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.

Special Meeting Notice. To be timely, a shareholder proposal to be presented at a special meeting (assuming the notice of the special meeting
provides for business to be brought by shareholders) shall be received by the secretary at Infinity’s principal executive offices not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.

In either case, the notice must set forth all information regarding the proposed business and the proposing shareholder and any associated person
as required under the Infinity Regulations.

For nominations for election to the Infinity Board before an annual meeting, the shareholder must have given timely notice as described above.

Notice of Stockholder and Shareholder Meetings

Kemper

The DGCL requires written notice to stockholders of the place (if any), date, hour and means of remote communication, if any, of each annual and
special meeting of stockholders at least ten (10) days, but no more than sixty (60) days, before the meeting date, unless other provisions of the DGCL
require a different notice period. Pursuant to the DGCL, notice of a meeting to vote on a merger agreement, a sale, lease or exchange of all or
substantially all assets, a conversion to another form of entity or a transfer, domestication or conveyance to a foreign jurisdiction must be given at least
twenty (20) days before the date of such meeting.

The Kemper Bylaws provide that notice, in writing or by electronic transmission, of an annual or special meeting shall be given to each
stockholder entitled to vote as of the applicable record date, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, except as
otherwise provided in the DGCL, the Kemper Charter or the Kemper Bylaws.

of remote communications, be provided, not less than seven (7) nor more

than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting unless a longer period is specified by a company’s articles of incorporation or code of regulations.

The Infinity Regulations provide that written notice of the time, place and purposes of any meeting of Infinity shareholders shall be given to each
shareholder of record as of the applicable record date not less than seven (7) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date fixed for the meeting and
as prescribed by law.

Supermajority Vote Requirements

Kemper

The Kemper Charter requires that each of the following transactions, subject to certain exceptions, with an Interested Stockholder be approved by
the affirmative vote in person or by proxy of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of
capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class:
 

 
•  any merger or consolidation of Kemper or any subsidiary with any Interested Stockholder or any other person (whether or not itself an

Interested Stockholder) which is, or after such merger or consolidation would be, an affiliate of an Interested Stockholder;
 

 
•  any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any

Interested Stockholder or any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder of any assets of Kemper or any subsidiary having an aggregate fair
market value of $10,000,000 or more;

 

 
•  the issuance or transfer by Kemper or any subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities of Kemper or any

subsidiary to any Interested Stockholder or any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder in exchange for cash, securities or other property (or a
combination thereof) having an aggregate fair market value of $10,000,000 or more;

 

 
•  the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Kemper proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Stockholder or

any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder; or
 

 

•  any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split or recapitalization of Kemper) or any merger or consolidation of Kemper
with any of its subsidiaries or any other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving any Interested Stockholder) which
has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible
securities of Kemper or any subsidiary beneficially owned by any Interested Stockholder or any affiliate of any Interested Stockholder.

Kemper may only enter into one of the transactions described above if, in addition to certain other conditions described in the Kemper Charter, the
following conditions are met:
 

 

•  the transaction has been approved by a majority of Kemper’s “continuing directors,” being (i) members of Kemper’s original board of
directors, (ii) persons unaffiliated with an Interested Stockholder who were members of the Kemper Board prior to such person or entity
becoming an Interested Stockholder, or (iii) successors of continuing directors who were recommended to succeed continuing directors by a
majority of continuing directors then on the Kemper Board; or

 

 

•  the consideration to be received by the holders of each class or series of Kemper’s capital stock is (i) not less than the highest price paid by
the Interested Stockholder for any shares of such class or series during the preceding twenty-four (24) months and (ii) is either in cash or in
the form of consideration previously used by the Interested Stockholder to acquire the largest number of shares of such class or series
previously acquired by such Interested Stockholder, and certain other conditions have been met.

Additionally, the affirmative vote in person or by proxy of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all then-
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of

directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal the articles in the Kemper Charter with respect to (i) shareholder
action by written consent (Article Six), (ii) the calling of special meetings and procedures for removing the Chairman of the Kemper Board (Article Six)
and (iii) business combinations and related transactions (Article Seven).

Infinity

Under the OGCL, in the case of most mergers, sales of all or substantially all the assets of a corporation and amendments to a corporation’s
articles of incorporation, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation is required unless the corporation’s articles of
incorporation provide for a lower amount (but, in such case, not less than a majority is required).

The Infinity Articles require only that the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of Infinity shall be
required to amend the Infinity Articles, approve mergers and to take any other action which by law must be approved by a specified percentage of all
outstanding shares entitled to vote or of the voting power of Infinity.

Number of Directors; Vacancies

Kemper

The Kemper Board currently has ten (10) directors.

Pursuant to the Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws, the number of directors which shall constitute the Kemper Board shall be not less than three
(3) nor more than twelve (12), with the number of directors to be determined exclusively by resolution of the Kemper Board. The Kemper Board shall
designate one of its members as Chairman to serve until his resignation or removal. The Chairman may be removed only by a majority of directors.

The Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of preferred stock and to the requirements of law, unless
the Kemper Board otherwise determines, newly created director positions resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any
vacancies resulting from any cause may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, even where less than a quorum. No decrease in the
number of authorized directors constituting the Kemper Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

Infinity

The Infinity Board currently has ten (10) directors.

Pursuant to the Infinity Regulations, the number of directors of the Infinity Board shall not be less than two (2). The number of directors may be
fixed or changed at a meeting of the shareholders called for the purposes of electing directors at which a quorum is present by a majority of the votes
cast by shareholders at such meeting. In addition, the number of directors may be fixed or changed by action of the directors at any meeting at which a
quorum is present by a majority vote of the directors present at such meeting.

Subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock, in the event of any vacancies or newly created director position in the Infinity
Board for any reason, the remaining directors, though less than a majority of the whole Infinity Board, may fill any such vacancy for the unexpired term.

Classified Board

Kemper

The DGCL permits a classified board of directors, but the Kemper Board is not divided into classes.

Infinity

The OGCL permits a classified board of directors, but the Infinity Board is not divided into classes.

Election of Directors

Kemper

Under the Kemper Bylaws, in an election of directors at a meeting of Kemper stockholders at which a quorum is present, a nominee for director
shall be elected to the Kemper Board if the votes cast for such nominee’s election exceed the votes cast against such nominee’s election (with
abstentions and “broker non-votes” not counted as a vote cast either “FOR” or “AGAINST” such nominee’s election). However, in the event the
secretary of Kemper has received one or more stockholder notices nominating at least one person for election and the number of nominees for director is
greater than the number of directors to be elected, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. An election by plurality vote means that the
nominees receiving the greatest number of votes cast shall be elected.

Infinity

Under the Infinity Regulations, the election of directors shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast, provided that a quorum is present.
Votes cast shall include direction to withhold authority in each case and shall exclude abstentions and “broker non-votes” with respect to that director’s
election.

In voting to elect directors, shareholders are entitled to cumulate their votes and to give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of
directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares held by the shareholder, or to distribute their votes on the same principle among as many
candidates as the shareholder so desires. In order to invoke cumulative voting, notice of cumulative voting must be given in writing by a shareholder to
Infinity’s secretary not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time fixed for holding the meeting to elect directors.

If the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected or if cumulative voting is in effect, the directors shall be elected by the
vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

Duties of Directors

Kemper

Standards of conduct for directors under the DGCL have developed through written opinions of the Delaware courts. Generally, directors of
Delaware corporations are subject to a duty of loyalty and a duty of care. The duty of care requires that directors act in an informed and deliberate
manner and inform themselves, before making a business decision, of all relevant material information reasonably available to them. The duty of care
also requires that directors exercise care in overseeing and investigating the conduct of corporate employees. The duty of loyalty may be summarized as
the duty to act in good faith, not out of self-interest, and in a manner that the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation
and its stockholders. When directors act consistently with their duties of loyalty and care, their decisions generally are presumed to be valid under the
“business judgment rule.”

Under the DGCL, a director, or a member of any committee designated by the board of directors, will, in the performance of such director’s
duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements
presented to the corporation by any of the corporation’s officers or employees, or committees of the board of directors, or by any other person as to
matters the director reasonably believes are within such other person’s professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable
care by or on behalf of the corporation.

Table of Contents

Infinity

The OGCL provides that directors shall perform their duties as a director, including duties as members of any committee, in good faith, in a
manner the director reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with the care that an ordinarily prudent
person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. The OGCL has a general presumption of business judgment that defers to the decisions
of a board of directors, but this presumption is rebutted if the board of directors acts in bad faith or is self-interested, in which case the board of directors
must show that the transaction is “fair and reasonable” by a preponderance of the evidence.

Removal of Directors

Kemper

Under the DGCL, directors may generally be removed from office, with or without cause, by a vote of a majority of the shares then entitled to
vote at an election of directors. The Kemper Charter and the Kemper Bylaws are silent with respect to the removal of directors and such removal is
therefore governed by the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Infinity

Under the OGCL, unless a corporation’s articles or regulations provide that no director may be removed from office or that removal of directors
requires a greater vote than that specified in this division, directors may be removed from office, without assigning any cause, by the vote of the holders
of a majority of the voting power entitling them to elect directors in place of those to be removed, except that, unless all the directors, or all the directors
of a particular class, are removed, no individual director shall be removed if the votes of a sufficient number of shares are cast against the director’s
removal that, if cumulatively voted at an election of all the directors, or all the directors of a particular class, as the case may be, would be sufficient to
elect at least one director.

The Infinity Articles and Infinity Regulations are silent with respect to the removal of directors and such removal is therefore governed by the
applicable provisions of the OGCL.

Limitation on Liability of Directors for Breach of Fiduciary Duty

Kemper

The DGCL provides that a corporation’s certificate of incorporation may limit the personal liability of a director to the company or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. However, no such limit would apply for (a) any breach of the director’s
duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders, (b) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (c) payment of a dividend or approval of a stock repurchase or redemption in violation of the DGCL or (d) any transaction from which
the director derived any improper personal benefit.

The Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws eliminate the personal liability of directors to Kemper or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, but not with regard to a director’s liability for breach of duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, willful or negligent violation of DGCL provisions regarding dividend payments or
stock purchase or redemption, or any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

Infinity

Under the OGCL, directors and officers are not liable for damages unless clear and convincing evidence shows that they acted with deliberate
intent to cause injury to the corporation or with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation.

Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses

Kemper

Under the DGCL, a corporation may only offer indemnification to indemnified persons if such indemnified persons reasonably acted in good faith
and in a manner reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed, to the best interests of the corporation, and in the case of any criminal action or
proceeding, such indemnified persons must have had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. In the case of an action by or in the
right of the corporation, the corporation may not indemnify indemnified persons if they are adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery or other applicable court determines that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification. The DGCL also requires
corporations to indemnify current or former directors or officers against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such
persons in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein to extent that such person has
been successful on the merits or otherwise.

The Kemper Charter provides that each person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is involuntarily involved in
any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director or officer of Kemper, or is or was serving (during his or her tenure as director and/or officer) at the request of Kemper as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the basis of such Proceeding is an alleged
action or inaction in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by Kemper to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL (or other applicable law), as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”) excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection with such Proceeding. Such director or officer shall have the right to be paid by Kemper for expenses incurred in defending any such
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the DGCL (or other applicable law) requires, the payment of such expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt by Kemper of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the relevant
provisions of the Kemper Charter.

If a claim as described above is not paid in full by Kemper within ninety (90) days after a claim has been received by Kemper, the claimant may at
any time thereafter bring suit against Kemper to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, together with interest thereon, and, if successful in whole or in
part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection
therewith.

The Kemper Charter provides that Kemper may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Kemper Board, grant rights to indemnification,
including the right to be paid by Kemper the expenses incurred in defending any action, suit or Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any
employee or agent of Kemper to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Infinity

The Infinity Regulations provide that each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved
(including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative
(hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Infinity or that, being or having been such a director or
officer of Infinity, he or she is or was serving at the request of the directors or an executive officer of Infinity as a director, officer, partner, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company or other enterprise, including service with respect to an
employee benefit plan

Table of Contents

(hereinafter an “indemnitee”), whenever the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a director, officer, partner,
employee, or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by Infinity to the fullest extent permitted by the OGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits Infinity to provide broader indemnification rights
than permitted prior thereto), or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys’
fees, costs of investigation, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties arising under ERISA, rules or orders of the SEC or other federal or state acts,
rules or regulations) actually incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors, and
administrators. Subject to certain exceptions in the Infinity Regulations, Infinity shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by Infinity or the Infinity Board.

The right to indemnification conferred by the Infinity Regulations includes the right to be paid by Infinity the expenses incurred in defending or
prosecuting any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an “advancement of expenses”). An advancement of expenses incurred
by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to Infinity of an undertaking, by or on behalf of
such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that his or her
omission or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to Infinity or undertaken with reckless disregard
for the best interests of Infinity. An advancement of expenses shall not be made if the Infinity Board makes a good faith determination that such
payment would violate applicable law.

Transactions with Related Parties

Kemper

The DGCL generally provides that no transaction between a corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between a corporation and
any other corporation or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers, are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, will be
void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the board or committee that
authorizes the transaction, or solely because any such director’s or officer’s votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to the
director’s or officer’s interest and as to the transaction are known to the board of directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith
authorizes the transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than
a quorum; (2) the material facts as to the director’s or officer’s interest and as to the transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to
vote thereon, and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the transaction is fair as to the corporation as
of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee or the stockholders.

The Kemper Charter and Kemper Bylaws are silent with respect to related party transactions involving a director or officer, and such related party
transactions are therefore governed by the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Infinity

The Infinity Regulations state that directors are not barred from providing professional or other services to Infinity. Moreover, no contract, action
or transaction shall be void or voidable with respect to Infinity for the reason that it is between or affects Infinity and one or more of its directors, or
between or affects Infinity and any other person in which one or more of its directors are directors, trustees or officers or have a financial or personal
interest or for the reason that one or more interested directors participate in or vote at the meeting of the directors

•  the material facts as to the directors’ relationship or interest and as to the contract, action or transaction are disclosed or are known to the
directors or the committee and the directors or committee, in good faith, reasonably justified by such facts, authorize the contract, action or
transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a
quorum;

 

 

•  the material facts as to the director’s relationship or interest and as to the contract, action or transaction are disclosed or are known to the
shareholders entitled to vote thereon and the contract, action or transaction is specifically approved at a meeting of the shareholders held for
such purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of Infinity held by
persons not interested in the contract, action or transaction; or

 

 
•  the contract, action or transaction is fair as to Infinity as of the time it is authorized or approved by the directors, a committee thereof or the

shareholders.

Anti-Takeover Legislation

Kemper

Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination”
with any “interested stockholder” for three (3) years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested
stockholder attained such status with the approval of the corporation’s board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed
manner.

A “business combination,” in reference to Kemper includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation of Kemper or one of its subsidiaries
and an interested stockholder or the sale by Kemper or any of its subsidiaries to an interested stockholder of assets having an aggregate market value
equal to ten percent (10%) or more of either the aggregate market value of Kemper’s consolidated assets or the aggregate market value of Kemper’s
outstanding stock. In general, in relation to Kemper, an “interested stockholder” is any person that is the owner of fifteen percent (15%) or more of
Kemper’s outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of such person. For additional information regarding “interested stockholders” and
potential business combinations involving Kemper, see “Comparison of Rights of Kemper Stockholders And Infinity Shareholders—Supermajority Vote
Requirements.”

Infinity

The Infinity Articles state that Section 1701.831 (“Control share acquisitions procedures”) and Chapter 1704 (“Transactions involving interested
shareholders”) of the OGCL shall not apply to Infinity. Section 1701.831 of the OGCL requires shareholder authorization for any control share
acquisition of an issuing public corporation and Chapter 1704 of the OGCL prevents a public corporation from engaging in certain transactions with
interested shareholders for three (3) years after an interested shareholder acquires shares.

Appraisal and Dissenters’ Rights

Kemper

Under the DGCL, a stockholder who does not vote in favor of certain mergers or consolidations and who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal of his or her shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL shall be
entitled to an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair value of his or her shares. However, stockholders do not have appraisal rights if
the shares of stock they hold, at the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive

Table of Contents

notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the merger or consolidation are either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record
by more than 2,000 holders. Further, no appraisal rights are available to stockholders of the surviving corporation if the merger did not require the vote
of the stockholders of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the terms
of the merger agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another
corporation that will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash instead of fractional shares
or (d) any combination of clauses (a)–(c). Appraisal rights are also available under the DGCL in certain other circumstances, including in certain parent-
subsidiary corporation mergers and in certain circumstances where the certificate of incorporation so provides.

The Kemper Charter does not provide appraisal rights in any additional circumstance.

Infinity

Under the OGCL, shareholders of an Ohio corporation may be entitled to dissenters’ rights as dissenting shareholders in connection with:
 

 •  the lease, sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation;
 

 •  certain amendments to the corporation’s articles of incorporation;
 

 •  the corporation being merged into or consolidated with another corporation; and
 

 
•  any merger, combination or majority share acquisition in which the corporation is the acquiring corporation, if the shareholders of the

corporation are entitled to voting rights in connection with such transaction.

The OGCL provides that (i) if a corporation provides notice not later than twenty (20) days before the date of the meeting at which a proposal will
be submitted to the shareholders that may entitle shareholders to relief as a dissenting shareholder, a shareholder electing to be eligible as a dissenting
shareholder must deliver to the corporation before the vote on the proposal is taken a written demand for the payment of the fair cash value of the shares
as to which the shareholder seeks relief and (ii) if a corporation does not provide such notice, a shareholder of an Ohio corporation must deliver such
written demand to the corporation not later than ten (10) days after the taking of the vote on the matter giving rise to dissenters’ rights in order to retain
those rights.

Shareholders are not entitled to dissenters’ rights where: (i) the corporation is being merged or converted and (A) the shares of the corporation for
which the shareholder would be dissenting are listed on a national securities exchange as of the day immediately preceding the date on which the vote
on the proposal is taken at the meeting of the shareholders and (B) the consideration to be received by the shareholders consists of shares or shares and
cash in lieu of fractional shares that, immediately following the effective time of the merger, consolidation or conversion, as applicable, are listed on a
national securities exchange and for which no proceedings are pending to delist the shares from the national securities exchange as of the effective time
of the merger, consolidation or conversion, as applicable or (ii) the corporation is the surviving corporation in a merger or the acquiring corporation in a
combination or majority share acquisition and the shareholders are entitled to vote on the merger proposal, and the shares so entitling them to vote are
listed on a national securities exchange both as of the day immediately preceding the date on which the vote on the proposal is taken at the meeting of
the shareholders and immediately following the effective time of the merger, combination or share acquisition, and there are no proceedings pending to
delist the shares from the national securities exchange as of the effective time of the merger, combination or share acquisition.

Dividends

Kemper

The Kemper Charter provides that, subject to all of the rights of any preferred stock, dividends may be paid on Kemper common stock, as and
when declared by the Kemper Board, out of any funds of Kemper legally available for the payment of such dividends. Currently, Kemper does not have
any preferred stock outstanding.

Infinity

The Infinity Articles provide that, except as otherwise provided in the express terms of any series of any preferred stock, after full dividends or
distributions upon all series of preferred stock have been paid for all past and current dividend and distributions, dividends may be declared upon, or
distributions may be made on, the Infinity common stock at such rate as the Infinity Board may determine. Currently, Infinity does not have any
preferred stock outstanding.

Exclusive Forum

Kemper

The Kemper Bylaws provide that, unless Kemper consents in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another court of the State of Delaware or, if no court of the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the
federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of
Kemper, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to Kemper or Kemper’s stockholders by any director, officer or other
employee of Kemper, (iii) any action asserting a claim against Kemper or any director or officer or other employee of Kemper arising pursuant to any
provision of the DGCL, the Kemper Charter or the Kemper Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against Kemper or any director or officer or
other employee of Kemper governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

Infinity

The Infinity Articles and Infinity Regulations do not place restrictions on the forum in which certain actions may be brought.

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation

Kemper

Under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation may generally be amended by resolution of the Kemper Board together with the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon; provided, however, that no meeting or vote of stockholders is
required to adopt an amendment that affects only the changes described in Section 242(a)(1) and/or Section 242(a)(7) of the DGCL. Any amendment
that increases or decreases the aggregate number of authorized shares of a class, increases or decreases the par value of the shares of a class, or alters or
changes the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of a class as to affect them adversely also requires the separate vote of the class so

authorized shares of preferred stock.

Under the Kemper Charter, Kemper reserves the right to repeal, alter, amend, or rescind any provision contained in the Kemper Charter, in the

directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal the articles in the Kemper Charter with respect to (i) stockholder
authority to act by written consent (Article Six), (ii) the calling of special meetings and procedures for removing the Chairman of the Kemper Board
(Article Six) and (iii) business combinations and related transactions (Article Seven).

Infinity

The OGCL permits amendments to the articles of incorporation to be adopted by the directors of an Ohio corporation in certain cases and by the
shareholders, at a meeting held for that purpose, by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation, or, if the
articles permit, by the affirmative vote of a greater or lesser proportion, but not less than a majority, of such voting power, and, if so required by the
articles of incorporation or if the amendment would have certain affects specified in the OGCL with respect to a class of shares, by the affirmative vote
of the holders of shares of a particular class.

The Infinity Articles states that the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of Infinity is required to
amend the Infinity Articles.

Amendment of Kemper Bylaws and Infinity Regulations

Kemper

The Kemper Charter provides that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of Kemper stock required by law or the Kemper
Charter, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in
elections of directors, voting together as a single class, is required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Kemper Bylaws. Alternatively, the
Kemper Charter may be amended or repealed by a majority of directors then in office.

Infinity

The Infinity Regulations provide that they may be amended, restated or modified by the affirmative vote or the written consent of the shareholders
entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power on any proposal to amend the Infinity Regulations. However, the Infinity Regulations require a vote
of a majority of “disinterested shares” (determined as specified in Section 1704.01(C)(9) of the OGCL) then entitled to vote to amend, restate or modify
the following articles of the Infinity Regulations:
 

 •  Article II (Directors), Sections 2 (Number and Qualifications of Directors) and 3 (Term of Office of Directors);
 

 •  Article IV (Indemnification); and
 

 •  Article V (Amendments).

Alternatively, the Infinity Regulations may be amended, restated or modified by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors to the extent
permitted by Ohio law at the time of such amendment, restatement or modification.

KEMPER CORPORATION AND INFINITY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CORPORATION UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (the “pro forma financial statements”) are based on the separate
historical consolidated financial statements of Kemper and Infinity after giving effect to the Merger and the assumptions and adjustments described in
the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 is
presented as if the Merger had occurred on December 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2017 is presented as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2017. The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to
give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the Merger, (ii) factually supportable items and (iii) with respect to the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statement of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.

The preparation of the pro forma financial statements and related adjustments require certain assumptions and estimates. The pro forma financial
statements should be read together with:
 

 •  the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus;
 

 
•  Kemper’s audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2017; and
 

 
•  Infinity’s audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Infinity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2017 (as amended on Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on April 23, 2018).

Kemper’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Infinity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017 (as amended on Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on April 23, 2018) are incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
See “Where You Can Find More Information.” The pro forma financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting for
business combinations pursuant to the provisions of ASC 805, with Kemper considered the acquirer of Infinity for accounting purposes. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of
the closing date, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The pro forma financial statements set forth below give effect to, among other
things, the following:
 

 •  issuance of Kemper common stock to certain Infinity shareholders as a portion of the Merger Consideration;
 

 •  payment of cash to certain Infinity shareholders as a portion of the Merger Consideration;
 

 •  incurrence of debt to fund a portion of the cash payable in connection with the Merger Consideration;
 

 •  liquidation of certain Kemper investments to fund a portion of the cash payable in connection with the Merger Consideration; and
 

 •  transaction fees incurred in connection with the Merger.

The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed presented in the pro forma financial statements are based on preliminary estimates.
Determining fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimates of future cash flows and direct costs in
addition to developing the appropriate discount rates. Kemper believes the estimated fair values recognized for the assets to be acquired and the
liabilities to be assumed are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions currently available. The final determination of the fair values of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed will be based on the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities that exist as of the closing date, and, therefore,
cannot be made prior to the

closing date. In addition, the value of the portion of the Merger Consideration consisting of Kemper common stock will be determined based on the
closing price of Kemper common stock on the closing date. Accordingly, the purchase price and the amounts allocated to the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill could change significantly from the amounts used in the pro forma financial statements
presented below. Any increases or decreases in the fair value of relevant balance sheet amounts upon completion of the final valuations will result in
adjustments, which could be material, to the pro forma financial statements.

The pro forma adjustments and related assumptions are described in the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements. Kemper
believes that the assumptions used to derive the pro forma adjustments are reasonable given the information available. However, the adjustments that
will be recorded as of the closing may differ materially from the information presented in the pro forma financial statements due to a variety of factors,
including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The pro forma financial statements have been prepared by Kemper in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and
are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations that might have been achieved had the Merger been
completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined financial position or future results of operations that
the combined company will experience after the Merger. Neither Kemper nor Infinity can provide any assurance that the results indicated in the pro
forma financial statements will be realized or that Kemper’s or Infinity’s future financial results will not materially vary from the pro forma financial
statements. In addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income does not include any pro forma adjustments to
give effect to expected synergies, expected cost savings or restructuring actions that may be achievable or the impact of any non-recurring activity and
one-time Merger-related costs.

Certain financial information of Infinity, as presented in its historical consolidated financial statements, has been reclassified to conform to the
historical presentation in Kemper’s consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 4 of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements for an explanation of these reclassifications.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of the Merger

The Merger Agreement provides that, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Infinity, with Infinity continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper. The Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been unanimously approved by the Kemper Board and the Infinity
Board. The closing is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable closing conditions.

Note 2. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017 are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Kemper and Infinity after
giving effect to the closing and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes. Such pro forma adjustments are (1) factually
supportable, (2) directly attributable to the Merger and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income, expected
to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to the
provisions of ASC 805, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their
fair values as of the closing date.

The acquisition method of accounting uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” as “the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” This is an exit price
concept for the valuation of an asset or liability. Market participants are assumed to be buyers or sellers in the most advantageous market for the asset or
liability. Fair value measurement for an asset assumes the highest and best use by these market participants. Fair value measurements can be highly
subjective, and it is possible that participants applying reasonable judgment could develop different assumptions resulting in a range of alternative
estimates using the same facts and circumstances.

At this preliminary stage, the estimated identifiable finite-lived intangible assets include VOBA, agency relationships, trade name and internal-use
software. The estimated identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets include insurance licenses, which are not amortized, but will be subject to periodic
impairment testing and are subject to the same risks and uncertainties noted for the identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the
excess of the estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value of Infinity’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Upon the closing and the completion of a formal valuation study, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be
updated, including the estimated fair values and useful lives of the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and allocation of the excess purchase
price to goodwill.

The pro forma financial statements are presented solely for informational purposes and are not necessarily indicative of the combined financial
position or results of operations that might have been achieved had the Merger been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be
indicative of any anticipated combined financial position or future results of operations that the combined company will experience after the Merger. In
addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income does not reflect expected revenue synergies, expected cost
savings or restructuring actions that may be achievable or the impact of any non-recurring activity and one-time Merger-related costs.

Table of Contents

Note 3. Accounting Policies

As part of preparing the pro forma financial statements, Kemper conducted a review of the accounting policies of Infinity to determine if
differences in accounting policies require restatement or reclassification of results of operations or reclassification of assets or liabilities to conform to
Kemper’s accounting policies and classifications. During the preparation of these pro forma financial statements, Kemper did not become aware of any
material differences between accounting policies of Kemper and Infinity, except for certain reclassifications necessary to conform Infinity’s historical
consolidated financial statements to Kemper’s financial presentation, and accordingly, these pro forma financial statements do not assume any material
differences in accounting policies between Kemper and Infinity, except as disclosed in Note 4. Upon the closing, a more comprehensive review of the
accounting policies of Infinity will be performed, which may identify other differences between the accounting policies of Kemper and Infinity that,
when conformed, could have a material impact on the pro forma financial statements.

Note 4. Historical Infinity Conforming Adjustments

Financial information of Infinity in the “Historical Infinity” column of the pro forma financial statements has been conformed to the historical
presentation in Kemper’s consolidated financial statements. Installment and Other Fees of $105.8 million in Infinity’s historical statement of income for
the year ended December 31, 2017 were reclassified to Insurance Expenses.

Note 5. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

Upon closing, each share of Infinity common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by
Kemper or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Infinity or any of its subsidiaries and shares held by any holder of Infinity common stock who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares under Ohio law) will be cancelled and converted into, at the election of the holder of
such share, subject to proration and adjustment as described below and in the Merger Agreement, either (i) the Mixed Consideration (equal to 1.2019
shares of Kemper common stock and $51.60 in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes), (ii) the Cash Consideration
(equal to $129.00, without interest and subject to any required withholding of taxes), or (iii) the Stock Consideration (equal to 2.0031 shares of Kemper
common stock). Holders of Infinity common stock who do not make an election will receive the Mixed Consideration. The consideration to be paid to
Infinity shareholders electing to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration is subject, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to
automatic adjustment, as applicable, to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and the total number of shares of Kemper common stock issued in the
Merger is approximately the same as what would be paid and issued if all Infinity shareholders were to receive the Mixed Consideration. No fractional
shares of Kemper common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Infinity shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Kemper
common stock.

Intangible assets were identified that met either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion described in ASC 805. The VOBA
intangible asset represents the present value of the expected underwriting profit within policies that were in-force at the assumed closing date. Agency
relationships represent the network through which Infinity conducted its operations and existing Infinity policyholder relationships. The fair value of
agency relationships was estimated using the income approach. Critical inputs into the valuation model for agency relationships include sales field force
cost and time estimates to recreate the number of acquired agents and an estimate of lost underwriting profit during this time to recreate the agents
acquired. Internal-use software relates to Infinity’s software used internally and was estimated using the cost approach. The Infinity trade name was
estimated using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. Licenses, which represents the regulatory licenses held by Infinity, was
valued using the market approach. The preliminary allocation to intangible assets is as follows:
 

(Dollars in Millions)   Dec. 31, 2017 
VOBA   $ 114.6 
Agency Relationships    52.5 
Internal-use Software    68.8

Licenses    8.0
