MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Shareholders of Columbia Banking System, Inc. and Pacific Continental Corporation,

Columbia Banking System, Inc. which we refer to as Columbia, and Pacific Continental Corporation, which we refer to as Pacific
Continental, have entered into a definitive merger agreement, which we refer to as the merger agreement, that provides for the
combination of the two companies. Under the merger agreement, a to-be-formed Oregon corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Columbia will merge with and into Pacific Continental, with Pacific Continental as the surviving corporation, which we refer to as the
first merger. Immediately following the first merger and as part of a single integrated transaction, Pacific Continental will merge with
and into Columbia, with Columbia as the surviving entity, which we refer to as the subsequent merger. Immediately following the
subsequent merger, Pacific Continental Bank, an Oregon state-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Continental, will
merge with and into Columbia State Bank, a Washington state-charted bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia, which we refer
to as Columbia Bank, with Columbia Bank as the surviving bank, which we refer to as the bank merger, and collectively, with the first
merger and the subsequent merger, the mergers. Before we complete the mergers, the shareholders of Columbia must approve the
issuance of Columbia common shares and the shareholders of Pacific Continental must approve the merger agreement. Columbia and
Pacific Continental shareholders will vote to issue Columbia common shares and approve the merger agreement, respectively, at their
special meetings of shareholders, each of which will be held on June 8, 2017.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Pacific Continental shareholders will have the right, with respect to each of their
Pacific Continental common shares, to receive a number of Columbia common shares equal to the exchange ratio as set forth in the
merger agreement, which we refer to as the exchange ratio, subject to any adjustment set forth in the merger agreement, which we refer
to as the merger consideration. As of January 9, 2017, the date the mergers were announced, based on the expected issuance of
14,535,729 Columbia common shares in the first merger, the total merger consideration payable to holders of Pacific Continental
common shares was valued at approximately $629.5 million. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, based on the
expected issuance of 14,535,729 Columbia common shares in the first merger, the total merger consideration payable to holders of
Pacific Continental common shares is valued at approximately $583.5 million. We expect the transactions to be tax-free for Pacific
Continental shareholders. After completion of the first merger, based on the current issued and outstanding Columbia common shares
and the 14,535,729 Columbia common shares expected to be issued to Pacific Continental shareholders, Pacific Continental
shareholders would own approximately 20% of Columbia’s common shares (ignoring any shares of Columbia common shares they
may already own).

The value of the consideration to be received for each Pacific Continental common share exchanged in the first merger will be
determined based on to the exchange ratio, which depends on the average daily closing price of Columbia common shares on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market, which we refer to as Nasdaq, on the 20 consecutive Nasdaq trading days ending on and including the
trading day that is five trading days prior to the closing of the transaction, which period we refer to as the determination period and
which price we refer to as the Columbia average closing price. The exchange ratio, which may be adjusted for transaction expenses as
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, means the following:
 

 
•  If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than or equal to $27.76 and less than or equal to

$37.56, then the exchange ratio will be 0.6430;
 

 

•  If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than $37.56, and the Columbia average closing
price for the determination period outperforms the Keefe Bruyette & Woods Regional Banking Index, which we refer to as
the KBW Index, by greater than 15%, then the exchange ratio will be the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth,
obtained by dividing (a) $24.151 by (b) the Columbia average closing price for the determination period;

 

 
•  If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than $37.56, and the Columbia average closing

price for the determination period does not outperform the KBW Index by greater than 15%, then the exchange ratio will be
0.6430;

 

 
•  If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is less than $27.76, and the Columbia average closing

price for the determination period underperforms the KBW Index by greater

than 15%, then the exchange ratio will be (a) the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing
$17.850 by the Columbia average closing price for the determination period if Columbia chooses not to adjust the merger
consideration in accordance with the merger agreement, or (b) 0.6430 if Columbia does choose to adjust the merger
consideration as set forth in the merger agreement and described below; and

 

 
•  If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is less than $27.76 and the Columbia average closing

price for the determination period does not underperform the KBW Index by greater than 15%, then the exchange ratio will
be 0.6430.

If Columbia chooses to adjust the merger consideration as set forth in the fourth bullet above, which it may do in its sole
discretion, the merger consideration will include an amount in cash equal to (a) $17.850 minus (b) (x) 0.6430 multiplied by (y) the
Columbia average closing price for the determination period, and the exchange ratio will be 0.6430.

If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is less than $26.13 (with a proportionate adjustment in the
event that outstanding Columbia common shares are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of the merger
agreement and the end of the determination period), either party may terminate the merger agreement; provided, however, if Columbia
elects to exercise such termination right, Pacific Continental will have the option of reinstating the first merger by adjusting the
exchange ratio to 0.6430, as may be adjusted for transaction expenses, and adding to the merger consideration an amount in cash equal
to $1.048 per share.

You should obtain current price quotations for Columbia common shares and Pacific Continental common shares. Columbia
common shares are traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “COLB,” and Pacific Continental common shares are traded on Nasdaq under
the symbol “PCBK.”

The Columbia board of directors has determined that the combination of Columbia and Pacific Continental is in the best interests
of Columbia and its shareholders based upon its analysis, investigation and deliberation, and the Columbia board of directors
recommends that Columbia shareholders vote “FOR” the issuance of Columbia common shares as set forth in the merger agreement
and “FOR” the approval of the other proposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The Pacific Continental board of directors has determined that the combination of Pacific Continental and Columbia is in the best
interests of Pacific Continental and its shareholders based upon its analysis, investigation and deliberation, and the Pacific Continental
board of directors recommends that the Pacific Continental shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and “FOR”
the approval of the other proposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

You should read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the appendices and the documents incorporated by
reference into the document, carefully because it contains important information about the mergers and the related transactions. In
particular, you should read carefully the information under the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 19 for a
discussion of the risks you should consider in evaluating the proposed mergers and how they will affect you.

The Columbia common shares to be issued to Pacific Continental shareholders in the first merger are not deposits or
savings accounts or other obligations of any bank or savings association, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other governmental agency.

shareholder meetings. They may not include all the information that is important to the shareholders of Columbia or Pacific
Continental. Shareholders of Columbia and Pacific Continental should each carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including the appendices and other documents referred to in this document.
 
Q: What are the transactions?
 

A: Columbia and Pacific Continental have entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to as the merger agreement,
pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, a to-be-formed Oregon corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Columbia, which we refer to as Merger Sub, will merge with and into Pacific Continental, with Pacific
Continental continuing as the surviving corporation, which we refer to as the first merger. A copy of the merger agreement is
attached as Appendix A to this document. Immediately following the first merger and as a part of a single integrated transaction,
Pacific Continental will merge with and into Columbia, with Columbia as the surviving entity, which we refer to as the
subsequent merger. Immediately following the subsequent merger, Pacific Continental Bank, an Oregon state-chartered bank and
wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Continental, which we refer to as Pacific Continental Bank, will merge with and into
Columbia State Bank, a Washington state-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia, which we refer to as
Columbia Bank, with Columbia Bank as the surviving bank, which we refer to as the bank merger, and together with the first
merger and the subsequent merger, the mergers. In order to complete the transaction, Columbia needs the approval of its
shareholders as to the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first merger, Pacific Continental needs the approval of its
shareholders of the merger agreement and each party needs the approval of the mergers by the applicable banking regulators of
Columbia, Columbia Bank, Pacific Continental and Pacific Continental Bank.

 
Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
 

A: Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental is sending these materials to its shareholders to help them decide how to vote their
shares of Columbia or Pacific Continental with respect to the proposed merger and other matters to be considered at the special
meetings, described below.

The merger cannot be completed unless Columbia shareholders approve the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first
merger and Pacific Continental shareholders approve the merger agreement. Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental is holding
a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the first merger. Information about the special
meetings and the mergers is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

This document constitutes both a joint proxy statement of Columbia and Pacific Continental and a prospectus of Columbia. It is a
joint proxy statement because each of the boards of directors of Columbia and Pacific Continental is soliciting proxies from their
respective shareholders. It is a prospectus because Columbia will issue Columbia common shares in exchange for Pacific
Continental common shares in the first merger.

 
Q: What will Pacific Continental shareholders receive in the first merger?
 

A: Under the terms of the merger agreement, Pacific Continental shareholders will have the right, with respect to each of their Pacific
Continental shares, to receive a number of Columbia common shares equal to the exchange ratio. The exchange ratio will be
determined as described below. In addition, we include the following tables which are intended to be illustrative of the
approximate aggregate consideration that would be payable in the first merger as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus based on different Columbia average closing prices. The tables do not reflect the fact that cash will be paid
in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of certain equity awards as further described herein, and do not account for any

adjustments that might be necessary in respect of transaction expenses exceeding the threshold amount, as further described
herein.

 

 

I. If the average daily closing price of Columbia common shares, which we refer to as the Columbia average closing price, on
Nasdaq for the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the fifth business day immediately prior to the closing date, which we
refer to as the determination period, is greater than or equal to $27.76 and less than or equal to $37.56, then the exchange
ratio will be 0.6430.

In addition, if, immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger, the transaction expenses incurred by Pacific Continental
exceed $14.5 million, which we refer to as the threshold amount, there will be an adjustment made to the exchange ratio such that
the excess amount of transaction expenses will be deducted from the aggregate merger consideration. In that event, the exchange
ratio will be equal to the product of (x) the exchange ratio as calculated in accordance with the merger agreement and described
above and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the aggregate merger consideration, as defined below, minus the reduction
amount, as defined below, by (2) the aggregate merger consideration. The aggregate merger consideration will equal $21.00
multiplied by the total number of Pacific Continental common shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing
(other than treasury shares). The reduction amount means, to the extent the transaction expenses exceed the threshold amount,
(a) the transaction expenses minus (b) the threshold amount, plus (c) any tax benefits estimated to result from the transaction
expenses exceeding the threshold amount, as reasonably estimated by Columbia. In the event of a transaction or series of related
transactions in which a person acquires record or beneficial ownership of Columbia common shares that, together with stock held
by such person, constitutes greater than 50% of the outstanding Columbia common shares, the reduction amount will be zero.

 
Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this document and the time the first merger is

completed?
 

A: Yes. Although the number of Columbia common shares that Pacific Continental shareholders will receive in the first merger will
be fixed based on the exchange ratio, other than in certain circumstances described below, the value of the merger consideration
will fluctuate between the date of this document and the completion of the first merger based upon the market value of Columbia
common shares. Any fluctuation in the market price of Columbia common shares after the date of this document will change the
value of the Columbia common shares that Pacific Continental shareholders will receive.

In the event the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than $37.56, and the Columbia average
closing price for the determination period outperforms the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period, in each
case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%, the exchange ratio will
fluctuate such that the value of the merger consideration to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders will fix at $24.151 per
share, calculated based on the Columbia average closing price for the determination period. If the Columbia average closing price
for the determination period is less than $27.76, and the Columbia average closing price for the determination period
underperforms the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period, in each case measured from the price on the
agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%, the value of the merger consideration to be received by Pacific
Continental shareholders will fix at $17.850 per share based on the Columbia average closing price for the determination period;
in that event, Columbia may, in its sole discretion, choose to either adjust the exchange ratio or maintain the exchange ratio of
0.6430 and add cash consideration such that the value of the merger consideration to be received by Pacific Continental
shareholders would equal $17.850, calculated as of the determination period.

Table of Contents

Q: How are Pacific Continental restricted stock awards addressed in the merger agreement?
 

A: As described under “The Mergers—Treatment of Pacific Continental Equity Awards,” at the closing of the first merger, any
vesting conditions applicable to any Pacific Continental outstanding restricted stock awards will automatically and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, accelerate in full and will be converted into, and become exchangeable for, the merger
consideration (less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting). 

 
Q: How are outstanding Pacific Continental stock options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights addressed in

the merger agreement?
 

A: Holders of Pacific Continental stock options, which we refer to as Pacific Continental options, restricted stock units, which we
refer to as Pacific Continental RSUs, and stock appreciation rights, which we refer to as Pacific Continental SARs, will receive an
amount in cash based on the per share value of the merger consideration. For this purpose, the value of the merger consideration
equals the exchange ratio multiplied by the Columbia average closing price for the determination period, which we refer to as the
equity award cashout price.

Pacific Continental Options. The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the first merger, all outstanding Pacific
Continental options, whether vested or unvested, will automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof be
cancelled and will only entitle the holders of such Pacific Continental options to receive (without interest), an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such Pacific Continental options immediately prior to the effective time
of the first merger, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any of (A) the equity award cashout price over (B) the exercise price per share
of such Pacific Continental options, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Pacific Continental RSUs. The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the first merger, all outstanding Pacific
Continental RSUs, whether vested or unvested, will automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be
cancelled and will only entitle the holders of such Pacific Continental RSUs to receive (without interest), an amount in cash equal
to (i) the number of shares subject to such Pacific Continental RSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger
multiplied by the equity award cashout price, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Pacific Continental SARs. The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the first merger, all Pacific Continental
SARs, whether cash-settled or stock-settled, vested or unvested, will automatically and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holders of such Pacific Continental SARs to receive (without interest) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such Pacific Continental SARs immediately prior to the
effective time of the first merger, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the equity award cashout price over (B) the reference
price per share of such Pacific Continental SARs, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. See
“The Mergers—Treatment of Pacific Continental Equity Awards.”

 
Q: When do Columbia and Pacific Continental expect to complete the mergers?
 

A: Columbia and Pacific Continental expect to complete the mergers after all conditions to the first merger in the merger agreement
are satisfied or waived, including after applicable shareholder approvals are received at the Columbia and Pacific Continental
special meetings and all required regulatory approvals are received. Columbia and Pacific Continental currently expect to
complete the mergers in mid-2017. It is possible, however, that as a result of factors outside of either company’s control, the
mergers may be completed at a later time, or may not be completed at all.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote?
 

A: Columbia Special Meeting. Holders of record of Columbia common shares at the close of business on April 12, 2017, which is the
date that the Columbia board of directors has fixed as the record date for the Columbia special meeting, are entitled to vote at the
Columbia special meeting.

Pacific Continental Special Meeting. Holders of record of Pacific Continental common shares at the close of business on
April 12, 2017, which is the date that the Pacific Continental board of directors has fixed as the record date for the Pacific
Continental special meeting, are entitled to vote at the Pacific Continental special meeting.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum?
 

A: Columbia Special Meeting. A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum at
the Columbia special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in determining the number of shares present at
the Columbia special meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum.

Pacific Continental Special Meeting. A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at the Pacific Continental special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be
included in determining the number of shares present at the Pacific Continental special meeting for the purpose of determining a
quorum.

 
Q: What am I being asked to vote on?
 

A: Columbia Special Meeting. Columbia shareholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  Approval of the Issuance of Common Shares. To approve the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first merger, which

we refer to as the Columbia share issuance proposal; and
 

 
•  Adjournment of Meeting. To approve one or more adjournments of the Columbia special meeting, if necessary or

appropriate, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Columbia share issuance proposal, which we
refer to as the Columbia adjournment proposal.

Pacific Continental Special Meeting. Pacific Continental shareholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  Approval of the Merger Agreement. To approve the merger agreement, which we refer to as the merger proposal;
 

 

•  Non-Binding Approval of Certain Compensation. To approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may
be paid or become payable to Pacific Continental’s named executive officers in connection with the mergers, and the
agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, which we refer to as
the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and

 

 
•  Adjournment of Meeting. To approve one or more adjournments of the Pacific Continental special meeting, if necessary or

appropriate, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal, which we refer to as the
Pacific Continental adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What will happen if Pacific Continental’s shareholders do not approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the merger-

related named executive officer compensation proposal?
 

A: The vote on the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to
approve the merger agreement. Pacific Continental shareholders may vote for this proposal and against the merger proposal, or
vice versa. Pacific Continental shareholders also may abstain from this proposal and vote on the merger proposal, or vice versa.
Because the vote on this proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Pacific Continental or Columbia. The merger-related
named executive officer compensation to be paid in connection with the mergers is based on contractual arrangements with the
named executive officers and accordingly the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments.

 
Q: How does the Columbia board of directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Columbia board of directors recommends that Columbia shareholders vote “FOR” the proposals described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q: How does the Pacific Continental board of directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Pacific Continental board of directors recommends that Pacific Continental shareholders vote “FOR” the proposals described
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please vote by
telephone or on the Internet, or complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it in the enclosed envelope as soon as
possible so that your shares will be represented at the Columbia special meeting or Pacific Continental special meeting, as
applicable.

Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form provided by the record holder if your
shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee.

 
Q: How do I vote?
 

A: If you are a shareholder of record of Columbia as of the record date for the Columbia special meeting or a shareholder of record
of Pacific Continental as of the Pacific Continental record date, you may vote by:

 

 •  accessing the Internet website specified on your proxy card;
 

 •  calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card; or
 

 •  signing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided.

You may also cast your vote in person at your respective company’s special meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, that institution will send you separate
instructions describing the procedure for voting your shares. Holders in “street name” who wish to vote in person at the applicable
special meeting will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds their shares.

 
Q: When and where are the Columbia and Pacific Continental special meetings?
 

A: The Columbia special meeting will be held at 1301 “A” Street, Suite 800, Tacoma, Washington 98402 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time,
on June 8, 2017. All shareholders of Columbia as of the Columbia record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the
Columbia special meeting.

The Pacific Continental special meeting will be held at The Inn at the 5th, Maple Room, 1st Floor, 205 East 6th Avenue, Eugene,
Oregon 97401, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, on June 8, 2017. All shareholders of Pacific Continental as of the Pacific Continental
record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Pacific Continental special meeting.

 
Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker or nominee vote my shares for

me?
 

A: If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must provide the record
holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank or
broker. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Columbia or Pacific
Continental or by voting in person at your special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your
broker, bank or other nominee.

Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares in street name for a beneficial owner typically have the authority to vote in
their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers, banks
or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are determined to be “non-routine” without
specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are
represented at the applicable shareholders meeting but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee is not instructed
by the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and the broker, bank or other nominee does not have
discretionary voting power on such proposal.

If you are a Pacific Continental shareholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your
shares, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the merger proposal, which broker non-votes will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote
your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the merger-related named executive compensation
proposal or Pacific Continental adjournment proposal, which broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote on these proposals.

If you are a Columbia shareholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your
broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Columbia share issuance proposal or the Columbia adjournment
proposal, which broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote on these proposals.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal to be considered at the Columbia special meeting?
 

A: The Columbia Share Issuance Proposal. The number of votes cast favoring the Columbia share issuance proposal must exceed the
number of votes cast opposing the Columbia share issuance proposal to approve the Columbia share issuance proposal.

The Columbia Adjournment Proposal. The number of votes cast favoring the Columbia adjournment proposal must exceed the
number of votes cast opposing the Columbia adjournment proposal to approve the Columbia adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal to be considered at the Pacific Continental special meeting?
 

A: The Merger Proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding Pacific
Continental common shares is required to approve the merger proposal.

The Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal. The number of votes cast favoring the merger-related
named executive officer compensation proposal must exceed the number of votes cast opposing the merger-related named
executive officer compensation proposal to approve the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal.

The Pacific Continental Adjournment Proposal. The number of votes cast favoring the Pacific Continental adjournment proposal
must exceed the number of votes cast opposing the Pacific Continental adjournment proposal to approve the Pacific Continental
adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What if I abstain from voting or do not vote?
 

A: For the purposes of the Columbia special meeting and the Pacific Continental special meeting, an abstention occurs when a
shareholder attends the applicable special meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting.

For purposes of the Columbia share issuance proposal and the Columbia adjournment proposal, if a Columbia shareholder present
in person at the Columbia special meeting abstains from voting, responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote or is not present in
person at the Columbia special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote on these proposals.

For purposes of the merger proposal, if a Pacific Continental shareholder present in person at the Pacific Continental special
meeting abstains from voting or responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST”
the merger proposal. If a Pacific Continental shareholder is not present in person at the Pacific Continental special meeting and
does not respond by proxy, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the merger proposal.

For purposes of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and the Pacific Continental adjournment
proposal, if a Pacific Continental shareholder present in person at the Pacific

Continental special meeting abstains from voting, responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote or is not present in person at the
Pacific Continental special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote on these proposals.

 
Q: May I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have delivered my proxy or voting instruction card?
 

A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the applicable special meeting. You may do this in one
of four ways:

 

 •  by sending a notice of revocation to the corporate secretary of Columbia or Pacific Continental, as applicable;
 

 •  by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card;
 

 
•  by logging onto the website specified on your proxy card in the same manner you would to submit your proxy electronically

or by calling the telephone number specified on your proxy card, in each case if you are eligible to do so, and following the
instructions on the proxy card; or

 

 
•  by attending the applicable special meeting and voting in person if your shares are registered in your name rather than in the

name of a broker, bank or other nominee; however, your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy.

If you choose any of the first three methods, you must take the described action (and, in the case of the second method, your
proxy card must be received) no later than the beginning of the applicable special meeting.

If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to
change your vote.

 
Q: Do I need identification to attend the Columbia special meeting or the Pacific Continental special meeting in person?
 

A: Yes. Please bring proper identification, together with proof that you are a record owner of Columbia or Pacific Continental
common shares, as the case may be. If your shares are held in street name, please bring acceptable proof of ownership, such as a
letter from your broker or an account statement showing that you beneficially owned common shares of Columbia or Pacific
Continental, as applicable, on the record date.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares after the record date but before the applicable special meeting?
 

A: The record date for the Columbia special meeting and the Pacific Continental special meeting is earlier than the date of each such
special meeting and the date that the mergers are expected to be completed. If you transfer your shares after the applicable record
date but before the date of the applicable special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting (provided that
such shares remain outstanding on the date of such special meeting), but you will not have the right to receive any merger
consideration for the transferred shares of Pacific Continental. You will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration in
respect of shares of Pacific Continental that you hold at the effective time of the first merger.

 
Q: What do I do if I receive more than one joint proxy statement/prospectus or set of voting instructions?
 

A: If you hold shares of Columbia and/or Pacific Continental directly as a record holder and also in “street name,” or otherwise
through a nominee, you may receive more than one joint proxy statement/prospectus and/or set of voting instructions relating to
the Columbia special meeting and/or the Pacific Continental special meeting. These should each be voted or returned separately to
ensure that all of your shares are voted.

 
Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers?
 

A: The first merger and the subsequent merger are intended to qualify, and the obligation of Columbia and Pacific Continental to
complete the first merger is conditioned upon the receipt of legal opinions from their

respective counsel to the effect that the first merger and the subsequent merger will qualify, as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which we refer to as the Code.

Accordingly, based on the opinions to be delivered in connection with the completion of the first merger, you generally will not
recognize any gain or loss upon receipt of Columbia common shares in exchange for Pacific Continental common shares in the
first merger (except with respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional Columbia common share, as discussed below under
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers—Cash Received In Lieu of a Fractional Columbia Common
Share” and except as discussed below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers—Alternative
Consideration Scenario”).

For a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the first merger and the subsequent
merger, please see the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers” beginning on page 104.

The tax consequences of the first merger and the subsequent merger to any particular shareholder will depend on that
shareholder’s particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine your tax
consequences from the mergers.

 
Q: Do I have appraisal or dissenters’ rights?
 

A: Under Oregon law, Pacific Continental shareholders are not entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the first
merger. See “The Mergers—Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates—Dissenting Shares.”

 
Q: What happens if the mergers are not completed?
 

A: If the mergers are not completed, Pacific Continental shareholders will not receive any consideration for their common shares of
Pacific Continental that otherwise would have been received in connection with the first merger. Instead, Pacific Continental will
remain an independent public company and its common shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. Please do not send your share certificates with your proxy card. Pacific Continental shareholders should follow the
instructions that will be provided in a letter of transmittal to be mailed after closing of the first merger regarding how and
when to surrender their share certificates. If you do not vote by internet or telephone, you should send the proxy card in the
enclosed envelope. If you are a shareholder of Pacific Continental, you will receive written instructions from Broadridge Issuer
Solutions Inc., the exchange agent, after the first merger is completed on how to exchange your share certificates for Columbia
common shares.

 
Q: Whom should I contact if I have any questions about the proxy materials or the meetings?
 

A: If you are a Columbia shareholder and have any questions about the mergers or any of the proposals to be considered at the
Columbia special meeting, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy card, you should contact Columbia Investor Relations, P.O. Box 2156 MS 3100,
Tacoma, Washington 98402, (253) 305-1921.

The Mergers and the Merger Agreement (pages 34 and 87)

The terms and conditions of the first merger are contained in the merger agreement which is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix A. The parties encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document
that governs the first merger.

Immediately following the first merger and as part of a single integrated transaction, Pacific Continental will merge with and into

Merger Consideration (page 34)

In the first merger, Pacific Continental shareholders will have the right, with respect to each of their Pacific Continental
common shares, to receive, as described below, an amount of Columbia common shares equal to the exchange ratio, which is
0.6430, subject to a customary collar and exchange ratio adjustment mechanisms, as more fully detailed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The value of the consideration to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders in the first merger will vary

Table of Contents

Recommendations of the Pacific Continental Board of Directors and Reasons for the Mergers (page 49)

Pacific Continental’s board of directors recommends that holders of Pacific Continental common shares vote “FOR” the
merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and “FOR” the Pacific Continental
adjournment proposal.

For further discussion of Pacific Continental’s reasons for the mergers and the recommendations of Pacific Continental’s
board of directors, see “The Mergers—Background of the Mergers” and “The Mergers—Recommendations of the Pacific
Continental Board of Directors and Reasons for the Mergers.”

Opinion of Columbia’s Financial Advisor (page 51)

In connection with the mergers, Columbia’s financial advisor, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., which we refer to as KBW,
delivered a written opinion, dated January 9, 2017, to Columbia’s board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view and as of the date of the opinion, to Columbia of the exchange ratio in the proposed first merger. The full text of KBW’s
opinion, which describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion, is attached as Appendix D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The
opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Columbia board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with
its consideration of the financial terms of the mergers. The opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Columbia to
engage in the mergers or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Columbia board of directors in
connection with the mergers, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Columbia common shares or any
shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the mergers or any other matter.

For further information, see “The Mergers—Opinion of Columbia’s Financial Advisor.”

Opinion of Pacific Continental’s Financial Advisor (page 64)

On January 9, 2017, D.A. Davidson & Co., which we refer to as Davidson, Pacific Continental’s financial advisor in
connection with the mergers, delivered an oral opinion to Pacific Continental’s board of directors, which was subsequently
confirmed in a written opinion, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth in
its written opinion, the exchange ratio was fair to the holders of Pacific Continental common shares from a financial point of view.

The full text of Davidson’s opinion, dated January 9, 2017, is attached as Appendix E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
You should read the opinion in its entirety for a discussion of, among other things, the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Davidson in rendering its opinion.

Davidson’s opinion was directed to Pacific Continental’s board of directors and is directed only to the fairness of the
exchange ratio to the holders of Pacific Continental common shares from a financial point of view. It does not address the
underlying business decision of Pacific Continental to engage in the first merger or any other aspect of the first merger and is not a
recommendation to any holder of Pacific Continental common shares as to how such holder of Pacific Continental common shares
should vote at the Pacific Continental special meeting with respect to the merger proposal or any other matter. Pursuant to an
engagement letter between Pacific Continental and Davidson, Davidson will receive a fee for its services, a substantial portion of
which will be payable upon consummation of the first merger.

For further information, see “The Mergers—Opinion of Pacific Continental’s Financial Advisor.”

Interests of Pacific Continental’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (page 80)

In considering the recommendation of the Pacific Continental board of directors, Pacific Continental shareholders should be
aware that certain directors and executive officers of Pacific Continental have interests in the first merger that may differ from, or
may be in addition to, the interests of Pacific Continental shareholders generally. The Pacific Continental board of directors was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, when it adopted the merger agreement and in making its
recommendations that the Pacific Continental shareholders approve the merger proposal. These interests include:
 

 
•  In accordance with the merger agreement, one of the community-based directors of Pacific Continental will be

recommended by Columbia’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to serve on Columbia’s board of
directors and the Columbia Bank board of directors effective upon the closing of the first merger;

 

 
•  In accordance with the merger agreement, Columbia will form an advisory board and invite all members of Pacific

Continental’s board of directors to join such advisory board;
 

 
•  Fifteen of Pacific Continental’s executive officers are party to agreements that provide for severance and other benefits

following a change in control of Pacific Continental in connection with a qualifying termination of employment;
 

 
•  Casey Hogan, who is the chief operating officer and executive vice president of Pacific Continental, entered into a

transition agreement with Columbia that becomes effective upon the completion of the first merger and that replaces an
existing employment agreement with Pacific Continental;

 

 
•  Certain of Pacific Continental’s executive officers and directors may have equity awards that under the merger

agreement become fully vested upon completion of the first merger; and
 

 
•  Pacific Continental directors and officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the

merger agreement.

For a more complete description of the interests of Pacific Continental’s directors and executive officers in the mergers, see
“The Mergers—Interests of Pacific Continental’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers.”

Regulatory Matters (page 38)

Columbia and Pacific Continental have each agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all regulatory
approvals required to complete the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Regulatory
approvals are required from the Federal Reserve Board, which we refer to as the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Oregon
Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions. As of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Columbia and Pacific Continental have submitted applications and notifications to obtain the
required regulatory approvals. There can be no assurances that such approvals will be received on a timely basis, or as to the ability
of Columbia or Pacific Continental to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of litigation challenging such
approvals. See “The Mergers—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Mergers.”

Conditions to Completion of the First Merger (page 98)

Currently, Columbia and Pacific Continental expect to complete the first merger in mid-2017. As more fully described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, the completion of the first merger depends on a number of
conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived. We cannot provide assurance as to when or if all of the conditions
to the first merger can or will be satisfied or waived by the appropriate party.

Table of Contents

No Solicitation (page 94)

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Pacific Continental has agreed not to initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any acquisition proposal (as
defined below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements”). Notwithstanding these restrictions,
the merger agreement provides that under specified circumstances, if Pacific Continental receives an unsolicited bona fide
acquisition proposal and the Pacific Continental board of directors concludes in good faith that such acquisition proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to result in, a superior proposal (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Covenants and Agreements”), then Pacific Continental and its board of directors may furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Pacific Continental board of
directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions would reasonably
be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that prior to providing any such nonpublic
information or engaging in any such negotiations, Pacific Continental entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third
party.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, none of the members of the Pacific Continental board of directors may, except as
expressly permitted by the merger agreement, make an adverse change of recommendation (as defined below in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements”), or cause or commit Pacific Continental to enter into any agreement or
understanding other than the confidentiality agreement referred to above relating to any acquisition proposal made to Pacific
Continental. Nevertheless, in the event that Pacific Continental receives an acquisition proposal that the Pacific Continental board
of directors concludes in good faith constitutes a superior proposal, the Pacific Continental board of directors may make an adverse
change of recommendation or terminate the merger agreement, if it concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel)
that failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, as
long as Pacific Continental gives Columbia prior written notice at least five business days before taking such action and during
such five business day period Pacific Continental negotiates in good faith with Columbia to enable Columbia to make an improved
offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of Pacific Continental as such alternative acquisition proposal.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 100)

The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to completion of the first merger by mutual consent, or by either
party in the following circumstances:
 

 
•  a requisite regulatory approval is denied and such denial has become final and non-appealable, or if a governmental

entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 

•  the first merger has not closed by November 9, 2017, provided that, subject to certain conditions, such date may be
extended to January 9, 2018, unless the failure of the closing to occur by such date is due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in
the merger agreement;

 

 

•  there is a breach by the other party of any of its covenants, agreements, representations or warranties that would,
individually or in the aggregate with other breaches by such party, result in the failure of a closing condition of the other
party, and such breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing the breach, or the
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured within such time (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement);

•  (a) Pacific Continental shareholders have not approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
at the duly convened Pacific Continental special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or
(b) Columbia shareholders have not approved the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first merger at the duly
convened Columbia special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, provided that the failure to obtain
such shareholder approval was not caused by the terminating party’s material breach of any of its obligations under the
merger agreement; or

 

 

•  immediately following the determination period, in the event that the Columbia average closing price for the
determination period is less than $26.13 (with a proportionate adjustment in the event of certain changes in Columbia’s
capitalization); provided, however, if Columbia elects to exercise such termination right, Pacific Continental will have
the option of reinstating the first merger by adjusting the exchange ratio to 0.6430 and adding to the merger
consideration an amount in cash equal to $1.048 per share.

The merger agreement may be terminated by Columbia prior to obtaining the Pacific Continental shareholder approval, in the
event that:
 

 •  Pacific Continental breaches in any material respect its non-solicitation covenants in the merger agreement;
 

 
•  Pacific Continental or the Pacific Continental board of directors submits the merger agreement to its shareholders

without a recommendation for approval or withdraws or materially and adversely modifies its recommendation with
respect to the merger agreement or recommends an acquisition proposal other than the mergers;

 

 
•  at any time after the end of five business days following receipt of an acquisition proposal, the Pacific Continental board

of directors fails to reaffirm its board recommendation as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five business
days) after receipt of any written request to do so by Columbia; or

 

 

•  a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Pacific Continental common shares is publicly disclosed (other than by
Columbia or one of its affiliates) and the Pacific Continental board of directors recommends that its shareholders tender
their shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within ten business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, the Pacific Continental board of directors fails to recommend unequivocally against acceptance of such
offer, which we refer to as a termination due to no company recommendation.

Prior to obtaining Pacific Continental shareholder approval, the merger agreement may be terminated by Pacific Continental
in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Covenants and Agreements”).

Expenses and Termination Fees (page 100)

Expenses

All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the mergers (including the costs and expense of printing and mailing this
joint proxy statement/prospectus) will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses.

Pacific Continental Termination Fee

Pacific Continental is required to pay Columbia a termination fee of $18,750,000 in the event that:
 

 
•  the merger agreement is terminated by Pacific Continental in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a

superior proposal;

 •  Columbia terminates the merger agreement due to no Pacific Continental board recommendation; or
 

 

•  any person has made an acquisition proposal with respect to Pacific Continental, which proposal has been publicly
announced, disclosed or proposed and not withdrawn, and: (1) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated (a) by
either party because the merger agreement has not been consummated pursuant to the termination provision for delay or
pursuant to the termination provision for no approval by Pacific Continental shareholders or (b) by Columbia pursuant to
the termination provision for breach, and (2) within 12 months after such termination of the merger agreement, an
acquisition proposal with respect to Pacific Continental is entered into (provided that references to “more than 15%” in
the definition of acquisition proposal are deemed to be references to “at least 50%”).

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers (page 104)

The first merger and the subsequent merger are intended to qualify, and the obligation of Columbia and Pacific Continental to
complete the first merger is conditioned upon receipt of legal opinions from their respective counsel to the effect that the first
merger and the subsequent merger, taken together, will qualify, as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Subject to the
limitations and qualifications described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers”
beginning on page 104 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, it is the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell and Pillsbury that the first
merger and subsequent merger, taken together, will so qualify, and that the specific U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S.
holder (as defined below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers”) exchanging Pacific Continental
common shares in the first merger will be as follows:
 

 

•  no gain or loss will be recognized by U.S. holders who receive Columbia common shares in exchange for Pacific
Continental common shares pursuant to the first merger (except for any gain or loss that may result from the receipt of
cash in lieu of fractional Columbia common shares that the U.S. holders would otherwise be entitled to receive as
discussed below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers—Cash Received In Lieu of a
Fractional Columbia Common Share” and except as discussed below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Mergers—Alternative Consideration Scenario”);

 

 
•  the aggregate basis of the Columbia common shares received in the first merger will be the same as the aggregate basis

of the Pacific Continental common shares surrendered in the exchange, decreased by any basis attributable to fractional
interests in Columbia common shares for which cash is received; and

 

 
•  the holding period of Columbia common shares received in exchange for Pacific Continental common shares will

include the holding period of the Pacific Continental common shares surrendered in the exchange.

Table of Contents

Any gain or loss recognized upon the exchange will generally be capital gain, and will be long-term capital gain if, as of the
effective date of the first merger, the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to its surrendered Pacific Continental common
shares exceeds one year.

For a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transactions, see “Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers.”

You are encouraged to consult your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the mergers in your particular circumstances,
including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any state,
local or foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Pacific Continental common
shares. Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor for
a full understanding of the particular tax consequences of the mergers to you.

Rights of Pacific Continental Shareholders Will Change as a Result of the First Merger (page 118)

The rights of Pacific Continental shareholders are governed by Oregon law and by Pacific Continental’s second amended and
restated articles of incorporation, as amended, which we refer to as the Pacific Continental articles, and Pacific Continental’s
amended and restated bylaws, which we refer to as the Pacific Continental bylaws. The rights of Columbia shareholders are
governed by Washington law and by Columbia’s amended and restated articles of incorporation, which we refer to as the Columbia
articles, and Columbia’s amended and restated bylaws, which we refer to as the Columbia bylaws. Upon the completion of the first
merger, there will no longer be any publicly held Pacific Continental common shares. Pacific Continental shareholders will no
longer have any direct interest in Pacific Continental. Those Pacific Continental shareholders receiving Columbia common shares
as merger consideration will only participate in the combined company’s future earnings and potential growth through their
ownership of Columbia common shares. All of the other incidents of direct stock ownership in Pacific Continental will be
extinguished upon completion of the first merger. The rights of former Pacific Continental shareholders that become Columbia
shareholders will be governed by Washington law, the Columbia articles and the Columbia bylaws. Therefore, Pacific Continental
shareholders that receive Columbia common shares in the first merger will have different rights once they become Columbia
shareholders. See “Comparison of Certain Rights of Holders of Columbia and Pacific Continental Common Shares.”

Risk Factors (page 19)

Before voting at the Columbia special meeting or the Pacific Continental special meeting, you should carefully consider all of
the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the risk factors set
forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and described in Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K
for the year ended on December 31, 2016, as amended, and other reports filed with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please see “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Documents Incorporated by
Reference.”

Table of Contents

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this document, including Columbia’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and Pacific Continental’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, as amended, and the matters addressed under the caption “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements,” Columbia and Pacific Continental shareholders should consider the matters described below carefully in
determining whether to approve the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first merger or vote to approve the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as applicable.

Risk Factors Relating to the Mergers

Because the market price of Columbia common shares may fluctuate, you cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration
that you will receive.

Upon completion of the first merger, each Pacific Continental common share (other than treasury shares) will be converted into
the right to receive merger consideration consisting of a number of Columbia common shares equal to the exchange ratio, pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement. Other than in certain circumstances described below, the number of Columbia common shares to be
received by a Pacific Continental shareholder will be determined based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.6430 of a Columbia common
share for each Pacific Continental common share (other than treasury shares). Accordingly, the value of the merger consideration to be
received by the Pacific Continental shareholders will be based on the value of the Columbia common shares at closing. The value of
the Columbia common shares to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders in the first merger may vary from the value as of the
date we announced the mergers, the date that this document was mailed to Pacific Continental shareholders, the date of the Pacific
Continental special meeting and the determination period. Any change in the market price of Columbia common shares prior to
completion of the first merger will affect the value of the merger consideration that Pacific Continental shareholders will receive upon
completion of the first merger. Accordingly, at the time of the Pacific Continental special meeting, Pacific Continental shareholders
will not know or be able to calculate the value of the per share consideration they would receive upon completion of the first merger.
Share price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in our respective
businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations, among other things. Many of these factors are beyond the control
of Columbia and Pacific Continental. Pacific Continental shareholders should obtain current market quotations for Columbia common
shares before voting their shares at the Pacific Continental special meeting.

In addition, the exchange ratio adjustment mechanisms provide that, in the event that the Columbia average closing price for the
determination period is greater than $37.56 and the Columbia average closing price outperforms the average price of the KBW Index
for the determination period, in each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%,
the exchange ratio will be adjusted such that the value of the merger consideration to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders
will fix at $24.151 per share, calculated as of the determination period. Additionally, in the event the Columbia average closing price
for the determination period is less than $27.76 and the Columbia average closing price underperforms the average price of the KBW
Index for the determination period, in each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by more than
15%, Columbia may adjust the exchange ratio or maintain the exchange ratio of 0.6430 and add an amount in cash such that the merger
consideration to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders will fix at $17.850 per share, calculated as of the determination period.
However, as noted above, at the time of the Pacific Continental special meeting, Pacific Continental shareholders may not know or be
able to calculate the exchange ratio used to determine the number of Columbia common shares they would receive with respect to each
Pacific Continental common share upon the completion of the first merger.

Table of Contents

The results of operations of Columbia after the mergers may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the
results of operations of Pacific Continental.

The businesses of Columbia and Pacific Continental differ in certain respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the
combined company and the market price of the combined company’s common shares may be affected by factors different from those
currently affecting the independent results of operations of Pacific Continental and Columbia. For a discussion of the business of
Columbia and certain factors to be considered in connection with Columbia’s business, see “Information Concerning Columbia” and
the documents incorporated by reference in this document and referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information.” For a
discussion of the business of Pacific Continental and certain factors to be considered in connection with Pacific Continental’s business,
see “Information Concerning Pacific Continental” and the documents incorporated by reference in this document and referred to under
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

The merger agreement limits Pacific Continental’s ability to pursue an alternative transaction and requires Pacific Continental to
pay a termination fee of $18,750,000 under certain circumstances relating to alternative acquisition proposals.

The merger agreement prohibits Pacific Continental from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or knowingly facilitating certain
alternative acquisition proposals with any third party, subject to exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. See “The Merger
Agreement—Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Change of Board Recommendation” included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The merger agreement also provides for the payment by Pacific Continental to Columbia of a termination fee of
$18,750,000 in the event that the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, involving, among others, the termination of
the merger agreement in certain circumstances followed by an acquisition, or a definitive agreement providing for an acquisition, of
Pacific Continental by a third party. These provisions may discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in
acquiring Pacific Continental from considering or proposing such an acquisition. It should be noted, however, that the failure of Pacific
Continental shareholders to approve the merger agreement will not in and of itself trigger Pacific Continental’s obligation to pay the
termination fee, unless other factors, including a third-party acquisition proposal for Pacific Continental, also exist. See “The Merger
Agreement—Termination; Termination Fee” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The opinions of Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s financial advisors delivered to the parties’ respective boards of directors prior
to the signing of the merger agreement do not reflect any changes in circumstance since the date of the opinions.

Each of the Columbia and Pacific Continental board of directors received an opinion from its respective financial advisor on
January 9, 2017, to address the fairness of the exchange ratio for Pacific Continental and Columbia, respectively, from a financial point
of view as of that date. Changes in the operations and prospects of Columbia or Pacific Continental, general market and economic
conditions and other factors which may be beyond the control of Columbia or Pacific Continental may have altered the value of
Columbia or Pacific Continental or the market prices of shares of Columbia or Pacific Continental as of the date of this document, or
may alter such values and market prices by the time the mergers are completed. The financial advisors do not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm their respective opinions to reflect subsequent developments, and have not done so. The opinions did not
address the fairness of the exchange ratio for Pacific Continental and Columbia, respectively, from a financial point of view at the time
the mergers are completed or as of any date other than the date of the respective opinions. However, Pacific Continental’s board of
directors’ recommendation that Pacific Continental shareholders vote “FOR” approval of the merger agreement is made as of the date
of this document, and Columbia’s board of directors’ recommendation that Columbia shareholder vote “FOR” approval of the issuance
of Columbia common shares is made as of the date of this document. For a description of the opinions that Columbia and Pacific
Continental received from their respective financial advisors, see “The Mergers—Opinion of Columbia’s Financial Advisor” and “The
Mergers—Opinion of Pacific Continental’s Financial Advisor” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

The mergers are subject to the receipt of approvals from governmental entities that may impose conditions that could have an
adverse effect on the combined company following the mergers.

Before the mergers may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Oregon
Department of Consumer Business Services and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions. These governmental
entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals or require changes to the terms of the mergers. Although Columbia
and Pacific Continental do not currently expect that any such material conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no
assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the
mergers or imposing additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the mergers, any of which might
have an adverse effect on the combined company following the mergers.

The first merger is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the mergers not being
completed, which may cause the prices of Columbia common shares or Pacific Continental common shares to decline.

The first merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval
of each party’s shareholders of certain merger-related proposals. If any condition to the first merger is not satisfied or waived, to the
extent permitted by law, the mergers will not be completed. In addition, Columbia and Pacific Continental may terminate the merger
agreement under certain circumstances even if the merger agreement is approved by each party’s shareholders. If Columbia and Pacific
Continental do not complete the first merger, the trading prices of Columbia common shares or Pacific Continental common shares
may decline. In addition, neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the mergers. If the mergers
are not completed and Pacific Continental’s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Pacific Continental
shareholders cannot be certain that Pacific Continental will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive
consideration than the consideration Columbia has agreed to provide. If the mergers are not completed, additional risks could
materialize, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of Columbia or Pacific
Continental. For more information on closing conditions to the merger agreement, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the
First Merger” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Columbia and Pacific Continental will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the mergers are
pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the mergers on employees, customers and vendors may have an adverse influence on the business,
financial condition and results of operations of Columbia and Pacific Continental. These uncertainties may impair Columbia’s or
Pacific Continental’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, depositors and borrowers pending the consummation of the
mergers, as such personnel, depositors and borrowers may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation
of the mergers. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers, vendors and
others who deal with Columbia or Pacific Continental to seek to change existing business relationships with Columbia, Pacific
Continental or the combined company or fail to extend an existing relationship with Columbia, Pacific Continental or the combined
company.

In addition, the merger agreement restricts Pacific Continental from taking certain actions without Columbia’s consent while the
mergers are pending. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on Pacific Continental’s business, financial condition and
results of operations. Please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements” for a description of the
restrictive covenants applicable to Pacific Continental.

Table of Contents

Columbia common shares to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders as a result of the first merger will have rights different
from the Pacific Continental common shares.

Upon completion of the first merger, the rights of former Pacific Continental shareholders who receive Columbia common shares
in the first merger and thereby become Columbia shareholders will be governed by the Columbia articles and the Columbia bylaws.
The rights associated with Pacific Continental common shares are different from the rights associated with Columbia common shares.
In addition, the rights of shareholders under Washington law, where Columbia is organized, may differ from the rights of shareholders
under Oregon law, where Pacific Continental is organized. See “Comparison of Certain Rights of Holders of Columbia and Pacific
Continental Common Shares” for a discussion of the different rights associated with Columbia common shares.

Columbia has various provisions in the Columbia articles that could impede a takeover of Columbia.

The Columbia articles contain provisions providing for, among other things, preferred stock, super majority approval of certain
business transactions, and consideration of non-monetary factors in evaluating a takeover offer. Although these provisions were not
adopted for the express purpose of preventing or impeding the takeover of Columbia without the approval of the Columbia board of
directors, such provisions may have that effect. Such provisions may prevent former Pacific Continental shareholders who receive
shares of Columbia common shares in the first merger from taking part in a transaction in which such shareholders could realize a
premium over the current market price of Columbia common shares. See “Comparison of Certain Rights of Holders of Columbia and
Pacific Continental Common Shares.”

Columbia and Pacific Continental shareholders will generally have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the first merger
and will exercise less influence over management.

Columbia shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Columbia board of directors and on other matters
affecting Columbia. Pacific Continental shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Pacific Continental board of
directors and on other matters affecting Pacific Continental. Upon the completion of the first merger, except for shareholders who own
common shares in both Columbia and Pacific Continental, each party’s shareholders will be a shareholder of Columbia with a
percentage ownership of Columbia that is smaller than such shareholder’s current percentage ownership of Columbia or Pacific
Continental, as applicable. It is currently expected that the former shareholders of Pacific Continental as a group will receive shares in
the first merger constituting approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of the combined company immediately after the first merger.
As a result, current shareholders of Columbia as a group will own approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of the combined
company immediately after the first merger. Because of this, Columbia and Pacific Continental shareholders will generally have less
influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of Columbia
or Pacific Continental, as applicable.

Sales of substantial amounts of Columbia’s common shares in the open market by former Pacific Continental shareholders could
depress Columbia’s share price.

Columbia common shares that are issued to shareholders of Pacific Continental in the first merger will be freely tradable without
restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act. As of the
Columbia record date, Columbia had approximately 58,328,142 common shares outstanding and 938,016 Columbia common shares
were reserved for issuance under the Columbia stock plans. Based on the number of Pacific Continental common shares currently
outstanding, Columbia currently expects to issue approximately 14,535,729 common shares in connection with the first merger.

If the first merger is completed and if Pacific Continental’s former shareholders sell substantial amounts of Columbia common
shares in the public market following completion of the first merger, the market price of Columbia common shares may decrease.
These sales might also make it more difficult for Columbia to sell equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that it otherwise
would deem appropriate.

The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers.

The success of the mergers will depend on, among other things, the combined company’s ability to combine the businesses of
Columbia and Pacific Continental. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve this objective, the anticipated benefits
of the mergers may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

Columbia and Pacific Continental have operated and, until the consummation of the first merger, will continue to operate
independently. It is possible that the integration process or other factors could result in the loss or departure of key employees, the
disruption of the ongoing business of Columbia or Pacific Continental or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and
policies. It is also possible that clients, customers, depositors and counterparties of Columbia or Pacific Continental could choose to
discontinue their relationships with the combined company because they prefer doing business with an independent company or for
any other reason, which would adversely affect the future performance of the combined company. These transition matters could have
an adverse effect on each of Columbia and Pacific Continental during the pre-merger period and for an undetermined amount of time
after the consummation of the mergers.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this document is illustrative only and the actual
financial condition and results of operations after the mergers may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this document is presented for illustrative purposes only
and is not necessarily indicative of what Columbia’s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the
mergers been completed on the dates indicated. The pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects adjustments, which
are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the Pacific Continental identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is
preliminary and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and
liabilities of Pacific Continental as of the date of the completion of the mergers. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting
adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more information, please see the
section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” beginning on page 108.

Following the consummation of the mergers, the combined company will be subject to substantial additional regulation.

Following the consummation of the mergers, the combined company will have greater than $10 billion in total consolidated assets
and be subject to substantial additional regulation. Areas of additional regulation will include, but not be limited to, more sophisticated
stress testing, compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential oversight requirements, enhanced governance
standards, including those relating to risk management, higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments, an interchange fee cap and direct
oversight and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with respect to various federal consumer financial protection
laws and regulations. These additional regulatory requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel,
design and implement additional internal controls or incur other significant expenses which could divert management’s attention away
from ongoing business concerns, place a burden on internal resources, impose additional costs or limitations on the combined company
and affect profitability. In addition, compliance with the stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may also
be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect the price of our common shares or our
ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities. Finally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-
Frank Act resulted in rules which cap the permissible interchange fee for certain electronic debit transactions to no more than 21 cents
plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. We currently anticipate a pre-tax annual
impact to the combined company from those rules of approximately $9.8 million; the combined company will be subject to the
interchange fee cap beginning July 1, 2018.

Certain Pacific Continental directors and officers may have interests in the first merger different from the interests of Pacific
Continental shareholders.

In considering the recommendations of the Pacific Continental board of directors, Pacific Continental shareholders should be
aware that certain directors and executive officers of Pacific Continental have interests in the mergers that may differ from, or may be
in addition to, the interests of Pacific Continental shareholders generally. The Pacific Continental board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, when it adopted the merger agreement and in making its recommendations that the
Pacific Continental shareholders approve the merger proposal. These interests include:
 

 
•  In accordance with the merger agreement, one of the community-based directors of Pacific Continental will be

recommended by Columbia’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to serve on Columbia’s board of directors
and the Columbia Bank board of directors effective upon the closing of the first merger;

 

 
•  In accordance with the merger agreement, Columbia will form an advisory board and invite all members of Pacific

Continental’s board of directors to join such advisory board;
 

 
•  Fifteen of Pacific Continental’s executive officers are party to an agreement that provides for severance and other benefits

following a change in control of Pacific Continental in connection with a qualifying termination of employment;
 

 
•  Casey Hogan, who is the chief operating officer and executive vice president of Pacific Continental, entered into a transition

agreement with Columbia that becomes effective upon the completion of the first merger and that replaces an existing
employment agreement with Pacific Continental;

 

 
•  Certain of Pacific Continental’s executive officers and directors may have equity awards that under the merger agreement

become fully vested upon completion of the first merger; and
 

 
•  Pacific Continental directors and officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger

agreement.

For a more complete description of the interests of Pacific Continental’s directors and executive officers in the mergers, see “The
Mergers—Interests of Pacific Continental’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers.”

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

The following table shows selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information about the financial condition
and results of operations of Columbia giving effect to the mergers with Pacific Continental. The selected unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information assumes that the mergers are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with
Columbia treated as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Pacific Continental, as of the
effective date of the mergers, will be recorded by Columbia at their respective fair values and the excess of the merger consideration
over the fair value of Pacific Continental’s net assets will be allocated to goodwill.

The table sets forth the information as if the mergers had become effective on December 31, 2016, with respect to financial
condition data, and on January 1, 2016, with respect to the results of operations data. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial data has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information, including the notes thereto, which is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under “Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does
not necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of
the period presented. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not consider any potential
impacts of current market conditions on revenues, potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and expense efficiencies,
or asset dispositions, among other factors. Further, as explained in more detail in the notes accompanying the more detailed unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial information included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information,” the pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded at the time the
mergers are completed. Additionally, the adjustments made in the unaudited pro forma condensed financial information, which are
described in those notes, are preliminary and may be revised.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA OF COLUMBIA (UNAUDITED)

Presented below for Columbia and Pacific Continental is historical, unaudited pro forma combined and pro forma equivalent per
share financial data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. The information presented below should be read together with the
historical consolidated financial statements of Columbia and Pacific Continental, including the related notes, filed by Columbia and
Pacific Continental, as applicable, with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where
You Can Find More Information.”

The unaudited pro forma and pro forma per equivalent share information gives effect to the mergers as if the mergers had been
effective on December 31, 2016, in the case of the book value data, and as if the mergers had been effective as of January 1, 2016, in
the case of the earnings per share and the cash dividends data. The unaudited pro forma data combines the historical results of Pacific
Continental into Columbia’s consolidated statement of income. While certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of fair
value adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not indicative of what could have occurred had the acquisition taken
place on January 1, 2016.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Columbia management
believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma data, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined
company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the impact of factors that may result as a consequence of the mergers or
consider any potential impacts of current market conditions or the mergers on revenues, expense efficiencies or asset dispositions,
among other factors, nor the impact of possible business model changes. As a result, unaudited pro forma data is presented for
illustrative purposes only and does not represent an attempt to predict or suggest future results. Upon completion of the mergers, the
operating results of Pacific Continental will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Columbia on a prospective basis.

This document, including information included or incorporated by reference in this document, may contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, (i) statements about the benefits of the mergers, including future financial and operating results, cost savings,
enhancements to revenue and accretion to reported earnings that may be realized from the mergers; (ii) statements about our respective
plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts; and (iii) other statements identified by
words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “prospects,” “projections,” or
“potential,” future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may” or words of similar meaning. These forward-
looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s managements and are
inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond
Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to
future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.

In addition to factors previously disclosed in Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s reports filed with the SEC and those identified
elsewhere in this filing (including the section entitled “Risk Factors”), the following potential factors, among others, could cause actual
results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations in the forward-looking statements:
 

 
•  the mergers may not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals and other

conditions to closing are not received on a timely basis or at all;
 

 
•  Columbia’s share price could change, before closing of the first merger, including as a result of broader stock market

movements, and the performance of financial companies and peer group companies;
 

 

•  benefits from the mergers may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including as a result of
changes in general economic and market conditions, interest and exchange rates, monetary policy, laws and regulations and
their enforcement, and the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which Columbia and Pacific
Continental operate;

 

 
•  operating costs, customer losses and business disruption following the mergers, including adverse developments in

relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; and
 

 •  management time and effort may be diverted to the resolution of merger-related issues.

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the proposed transactions or other matters attributable to
Columbia or Pacific Continental or any person acting on behalf of Columbia or Pacific Continental are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the cautionary statements above. Neither Columbia nor Pacific Continental undertakes any obligation to update any
forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.

THE MERGERS

The following is a discussion of the mergers and the material terms of the merger agreement between Columbia and Pacific
Continental. You are urged to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this
document and incorporated by reference herein. This summary may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that
is important to you. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety. Factual information about Columbia
and Pacific Continental can be found elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the public filings Columbia and Pacific
Continental make with the SEC, as described in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Terms of the Mergers

Transaction Structure

The merger agreement provides for the acquisition of Pacific Continental by Columbia through the merger of Merger Sub with
and into Pacific Continental with Pacific Continental continuing as the surviving corporation in the first merger. Immediately following
the first merger, Pacific Continental will merge with and into Columbia, with Columbia continuing as the surviving entity in the
subsequent merger. Immediately following the subsequent merger, Pacific Continental Bank will merge with and into Columbia Bank,
with Columbia Bank continuing as the surviving bank in the bank merger.

Merger Consideration

In the merger, Pacific Continental shareholders will have the right, with respect to each of their Pacific Continental common
shares, to receive a number of Columbia common shares equal to the exchange ratio, subject to any adjustments set forth in the merger
agreement. The exchange ratio means the following:
 

 
i. if the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than or equal to $27.76 and less than or equal to

$37.56, then the exchange ratio will be 0.6430;
 

 

ii. if the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than $37.56, and the Columbia average closing
price for the determination period outperforms the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period, in each
case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%, then the exchange ratio
will be the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing (A) $24.151 by (B) the Columbia average
closing price for the determination period;

 

 

iii. if the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is greater than $37.56, and the Columbia average closing
price for the determination period does not outperform the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period, in
each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%, then the exchange
ratio will be 0.6430;

 

 

iv. if the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is less than $27.76, and the Columbia average closing
price for the determination period underperforms the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period, in each
case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%, then the exchange ratio
will be (A) the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing $17.850 by the Columbia average
closing price for the determination period if Columbia chooses not to adjust the merger consideration in accordance with the
merger agreement, or (B) 0.6430 if Columbia does choose to adjust the merger consideration as set forth in the merger
agreement and described below; and

 

 

v. if the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is less than $27.76, and the Columbia average closing
price for the determination period does not underperform the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period,
in each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%, then the exchange
ratio will be 0.6430.

Table of Contents

In connection with clause (iv) above, if Columbia chooses to adjust the merger consideration, which it may do in its sole
discretion under those circumstances, the merger consideration will include an amount in cash equal to (A) $17.850 minus
(B) (x) 0.6430 multiplied by (y) the Columbia average closing price for the determination period, and the exchange ratio will be
0.6430.

The exchange ratio adjustment mechanisms provide that, in the event that the Columbia average closing price for the
determination period is greater than $37.56 and the Columbia average closing price outperforms the average price of the KBW Index
for the determination period, in each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by greater than 15%,
the exchange ratio will be adjusted such that the value of the merger consideration to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders
will fix at $24.151 per share, calculated as of the determination period. Additionally, in the event the Columbia average closing price
for the determination period is less than $27.76 and the Columbia average closing price underperforms the average price of the KBW
Index for the determination period, in each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by more than
15%, Columbia may adjust the exchange ratio or maintain the exchange ratio of 0.6430 and add an amount in cash such that the merger
consideration to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders will fix at $17.850 per share, calculated as of the determination period.
However, as noted previously, at the time of the Pacific Continental special meeting, Pacific Continental shareholders may not know or
be able to calculate the exchange ratio used to determine the number of Columbia common shares they would receive with respect to
each Pacific Continental common share upon the completion of the first merger.

If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period is less than $26.13 (with a proportionate adjustment in the
event that outstanding Columbia common shares are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of the merger
agreement and the end of the determination period), either party may terminate the merger agreement; provided, however, if Columbia
elects to exercise such termination right, Pacific Continental will have the option of reinstating the first merger by adjusting the
exchange ratio to 0.6430, as may be adjusted for transaction expenses, as described below, and adding to the merger consideration an
amount in cash equal to $1.048 per share.

The value of the Columbia common shares to be received by Pacific Continental shareholders in the first merger may vary
from the value as of the date we announced the mergers, the date that this document was mailed to Pacific Continental
shareholders, the date of the meeting of Pacific Continental shareholders and the determination period. Any change in the
market price of Columbia common shares prior to completion of the first merger will affect the value of the merger
consideration that Pacific Continental shareholders will receive upon completion of the first merger. Accordingly, at the time of
the Pacific Continental special meeting, Pacific Continental shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the value of the
per share consideration they would receive upon completion of the first merger.

Adjustment for Transaction Expenses

If, immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger, the transaction expenses incurred by Pacific Continental exceed the
threshold amount, there will be an adjustment made to the exchange ratio such that the excess amount of transaction expenses will be
deducted from the aggregate merger consideration. In that event, the exchange ratio will be equal to the product of (x) the exchange
ratio as calculated in accordance with the merger agreement and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the aggregate merger
consideration minus the reduction amount by (2) the aggregate merger consideration. In the event of a transaction or series of related
transactions in which a person acquires record or beneficial ownership of Columbia common shares that, together with stock held by
such person, constitutes greater than 50% of the outstanding Columbia common shares, the reduction amount will be zero.

Treatment of Pacific Continental Equity Awards

Pacific Continental RSUs

At the effective time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental RSU, whether vested or unvested, will,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holder of such Pacific
Continental RSU to receive (without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the effective time of the first merger and
in any event no later than 30 calendar days following the closing date, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of shares subject to
such Pacific Continental RSUs multiplied by (y) the equity award cashout price, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. The term equity award cashout price means an amount equal to the product of (x) the exchange ratio
multiplied by (y) the Columbia average closing price for the determination period.

Pacific Continental Options

At the effective time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental option, whether vested or unvested, will,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holder of such Pacific
Continental option to receive (without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the effective time of the first merger and
in any event no later than 30 calendar days following the closing date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares subject to such Pacific Continental options multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the equity award cashout price over
(B) the exercise price per share of such Pacific Continental options less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. Any Pacific Continental option which has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the equity award cashout
price will be cancelled at the effective time of the first merger for no consideration or payment.

Pacific Continental SARs

At the effective time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental SAR, whether cash-settled or stock-settled, whether
vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the
holder of such Pacific Continental SAR to receive (without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the effective time
of the first merger and in any event no later than 30 calendar days following the closing date, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares subject to such Pacific Continental SARs multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the equity award cashout
price over (B) the reference price per share of such Pacific Continental SARs less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment. Any Pacific Continental SAR which has a reference price per share that is greater than or equal to the equity award
cashout price will be cancelled at the effective time of the first merger for no consideration or payment.

Restricted Stock Awards

At the effective time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental restricted stock award will, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and will be converted into, and become exchanged for the merger
consideration (less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting).

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates

The conversion of Pacific Continental common shares (other than treasury shares) into the right to receive the merger
consideration will occur automatically at the effective time of the first merger. As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective
time of the first merger, the exchange agent will exchange certificates representing Pacific Continental common shares (other than
treasury shares) for merger consideration to be received in the first merger pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Letters of Transmittal

As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the first merger, but in any event within five business days thereafter,
the exchange agent will send a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for
the merger consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Columbia (as described below), and any dividends or distributions to
which a holder may be entitled (as described below), to each holder of record of certificates or book-entry shares which, immediately
prior to the completion of the first merger, represented Pacific Continental common shares, whose shares were converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration.

If a certificate for Pacific Continental common shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the
consideration properly payable under the merger agreement upon receipt of an affidavit as to that loss, theft or destruction and, if
requested by the exchange agent, the posting of a bond to indemnify the exchange agent against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such certificate.

Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares

No fractional Columbia common shares will be issued upon the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares for exchange, and
no dividend or distribution with respect to Columbia common shares will be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Columbia. In lieu of
the issuance of any such fractional share, Columbia will pay to each former shareholder of Pacific Continental who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Columbia
average closing price for the determination period by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Pacific
Continental common stock held by such holder at the effective time of the first merger and rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of Columbia common shares which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

Dividends and Distributions

Until certificates or book-entry shares representing Pacific Continental common shares are surrendered for exchange, any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the first merger with respect to Columbia common shares
into which such Pacific Continental common shares may have been converted will not be paid. Following surrender of any such
certificates or book-entry shares, the record holder thereof will be entitled to receive, without interest, any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the effective time of the first merger payable with respect to the whole number of Columbia
common shares represented by such certificates or book-entry shares and paid prior to the surrender date, and at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to Columbia common shares represented by such
certificates or book-entry shares with a record date after the effective time of the first merger but before the surrender date and with a
payment date after the issuance of Columbia common shares issuable with respect to such certificates or book-entry shares.

After the effective time of the first merger, there will be no transfers on the share transfer books of Pacific Continental of any
Pacific Continental common shares. If certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer after the completion of the first
merger, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the merger consideration into which the shares represented by that certificate have
been converted.

Dissenting Shares

Under Oregon law, Pacific Continental shareholders will not be entitled to exercise any appraisal or dissenters’ rights in
connection with any of the proposals being presented to them.

Table of Contents

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Mergers

Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals
required to complete the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval
from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services and the Washington State Department
of Financial Institutions, among others. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Columbia and Pacific Continental have
submitted applications and notifications to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

The prior approval of the FDIC will be required under Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which we refer to as
the Bank Merger Act, to merge Pacific Continental Bank with and into Columbia Bank. In evaluating an application filed under the
Bank Merger Act, the FDIC generally considers: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) financial and managerial resources
of the banks party to the bank merger, (3) the banks’ effectiveness in combating money-laundering activities and (4) the extent to
which the bank merger or mergers would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or
financial system. The FDIC also reviews the performance records of the relevant depository institutions under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1997, which we refer to as CRA, including their CRA ratings. In connection with its review under the Bank
Merger Act, the FDIC will provide an opportunity for public comment on the application for the bank merger and is authorized to hold
a public meeting or other proceeding if it determines that would be appropriate.

Transactions approved by the FDIC generally may not be completed until 30 days after the approval of the FDIC is received,
during which time the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the DOJ, may challenge the transaction on antitrust grounds. With
the approval of the FDIC and the concurrence of the DOJ, the waiting period may be reduced to no less than 15 days. The
commencement of an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of such an approval unless a court specifically ordered otherwise. In
reviewing the bank merger, the DOJ could analyze the bank merger’s effect on competition differently than the FDIC, and thus it is
possible that the DOJ could reach a different conclusion than the FDIC does regarding the bank merger’s effects on competition. A
determination by the DOJ not to object to the bank merger may not prevent the filing of antitrust actions by private persons or state
attorneys general.

Federal Reserve Board

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, which we refer to as the BHC Act. Columbia will submit an application pursuant to the
BHC Act and Regulation Y seeking the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for Columbia to acquire Pacific Continental. In
considering the approval of transactions such as the mergers, the Federal Reserve is required by the BHC Act to review, with respect to
the bank holding companies and the banks concerned: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) the financial condition and
future prospects, including capital positions and managerial resources, (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served
and the record of the insured depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding companies under the CRA, (4) the effectiveness of
the companies’ and the depository institutions’ concerned in combating money laundering activities and (5) the extent to which the
proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. In
connection with such a review, the Federal Reserve will provide an opportunity for public comment on the application and is
authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if it determines such meeting or other proceeding would be appropriate. The
Federal Reserve may not approve a proposal that would have significant adverse effects on competition or on the concentration of
resources in any banking market.

Table of Contents

Additional Regulatory Approvals and Notices

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are also subject to approval by the Oregon Department of Consumer and
Business Services and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, and notifications may be filed with various other
regulatory agencies.

There can be no assurances that such approvals will be received on a timely basis, or as to the ability of Columbia and Pacific
Continental to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of litigation challenging such approvals. There can likewise be
no assurances that federal or state regulatory authorities will not attempt to challenge the mergers on antitrust grounds or for other
reasons, or, if such a challenge is made, as to the result of such challenge. The parties’ obligations to complete the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals.

Accounting Treatment

In accordance with current accounting guidance, the mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method. The result of
this method is that the assets and liabilities of Columbia will be carried forward at their recorded amounts, Columbia’s historical
operating results will be unchanged for the prior periods being reported on and the assets and liabilities of Pacific Continental will be
adjusted to fair value at the date of the mergers. In addition, all identified intangibles will be recorded at fair value and included as part
of the net assets acquired. To the extent that the purchase price, consisting of cash plus the number of Columbia common shares to be
issued to former Pacific Continental shareholders at fair value, exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, including identifiable
intangible assets, from Pacific Continental at the date of the mergers, that amount will be reported as goodwill. In accordance with
current accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but, in general, will be evaluated for impairment annually. Identified
intangibles will be amortized over their estimated lives. Further, the acquisition method of accounting results in the operating results of
Pacific Continental being included in the operating results of Columbia beginning from the date of completion of the mergers.

Public Trading Markets

Columbia common shares are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “COLB.” Pacific Continental common shares are listed on
Nasdaq under the symbol “PCBK.” Upon completion of the first merger, Pacific Continental common shares will be delisted from
Nasdaq and thereafter will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange
Act. The Columbia common shares issued in the first merger will be listed on Nasdaq.

Resale of Columbia Common Shares

All Columbia common shares received by Pacific Continental shareholders in the first merger will be freely tradable for purposes
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, except for Columbia common shares received by any such holder who becomes an
“affiliate” of Columbia after completion of the first merger. This document does not cover resales of Columbia common shares
received by any person upon completion of the first merger, and no person is authorized to make any use of this document in
connection with any resale.

Background of the Mergers

From time to time, the board of directors of Pacific Continental assesses the economic, regulatory and competitive conditions in
which Pacific Continental operates as well as its long-term business strategy and objectives. During recent years, Pacific Continental’s
board of directors has reviewed and assessed strategic opportunities and challenges and has considered various strategic options
potentially available to Pacific Continental, all with the goal of enhancing Pacific Continental’s strategic capabilities and increasing
value for Pacific Continental’s shareholders. Columbia’s management and board of directors also regularly review the

financial services industry environment, including the trend towards consolidation in the industry, and periodically discuss ways in
which to enhance Columbia’s competitive position, including through the acquisition of other financial institutions.

During the past two years, the Pacific Continental board of directors has held strategic planning sessions during which
representatives of Davidson have provided the Pacific Continental board of directors with an overview of the banking environment,
updated the Pacific Continental board of directors on the bank equity market conditions and participated in discussions with the Pacific
Continental board of directors regarding various strategic transactions. During these strategic planning sessions, the Pacific Continental
board of directors has maintained an interest in remaining independent, but with an understanding of its fiduciary responsibilities to its
shareholders and with a mind to the overall goal of enhancing the franchise value for Pacific Continental’s shareholders.

Members of executive management, and less often members of the Pacific Continental board of directors, informally meet CEOs,
board members and executives of other banking institutions while attending investor conferences sponsored by investment banking
companies, the Washington and Oregon Bankers Associations and others, and on other occasions. Such meetings are typically brief and
involve discussions of current industry issues, but can include questions as to interest in pursuing more formalized discussions on
possible business combinations. During various of these conferences in 2015, Melanie Dressel, the Chief Executive Officer of
Columbia, and Roger Busse, the Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Continental, met informally. These meetings generally related to
industry issues relevant to both institutions, including developments and trends in the Pacific Northwest banking industry.

On June 17, 2015, Mr. Busse and Ms. Dressel met in Seattle, Washington and held informal discussions concerning the potential
benefits of a combination of the two companies for each company’s shareholders, customers and employees. Mr. Busse indicated that
he would inform the Pacific Continental board of directors of the discussion, and Ms. Dressel and Mr. Busse agreed to stay in touch on
the topic. On October 20, 2015, Mr. Busse and Ms. Dressel met again to discuss the possibility of a potential combination of Pacific
Continental and Columbia, and they agreed that the next step would be for the Chairman of each company’s board to meet and discuss.

On or around February 3, 2016, Ms. Dressel and Mr. Busse spoke by telephone. Ms. Dressel suggested to Mr. Busse that the
respective Chairmen of Pacific Continental and Columbia meet in Seattle or Portland, at an offsite location, to discuss the strategies of
the two banks. On February 16, 2016, Mr. Busse advised the Executive Committee of the Pacific Continental board of directors of this
informal discussion with Ms. Dressel and Columbia’s interest in a meeting between the Columbia board of director’s Chairman, Bill
Weyerhaeuser, and the Pacific Continental board of director’s Chairman, Bob Ballin. Mr. Ballin agreed to the meeting, but, in light of
discussions underway between Pacific Continental and several potential acquisition targets, including Foundation Bank, the Pacific
Continental Executive Committee decided that the meeting should be put off. Mr. Busse communicated this to Ms. Dressel, and, at
Mr. Ballin’s request, agreed to meet with Ms. Dressel sooner to gather information on specific topics of mutual interest and to schedule
a possible date for a meeting between Messrs. Ballin and Weyerhaeuser.

On March 8, 2016, at a banking conference, Ms. Dressel and Mr. Busse met briefly to discuss the date for the meeting between
Messrs. Ballin and Weyerhaeuser. It was determined that the meeting would be held in May 2016.

On March 23, 2016, the Columbia M&A Committee met to discuss, among other things, aspects of the model for a potential
business combination with Pacific Continental. The Columbia M&A Committee reported its discussions to the full board of directors at
a board meeting held later that same day.

On May 24, 2016, Mr. Ballin and Mr. Weyerhaeuser met at a restaurant at the Portland, Oregon airport. Topics discussed during
this meeting included Columbia’s interest in acquiring Pacific Continental and the

strategic rationale for such a combination, as well as Columbia’s interest in expanding the discussion to a more formal process by
executing a non-disclosure agreement allowing for due diligence to further ascertain the merits of a potential combination and the
potential price and pricing structure. Mr. Ballin advised Mr. Weyerhaeuser that, at that time, Pacific Continental intended to remain
independent and complete the acquisition and integration of Foundation Bank in Bellevue, Washington, which had been announced on
April 26, 2016. Both agreed to stay in touch as progress on the Foundation Bank acquisition continued.

On May 25, 2016, representatives of KBW met with the Columbia M&A Committee to discuss a potential combination of
Columbia and Pacific Continental and next steps in connection with a possible transaction. The M&A Committee then provided an
update to Columbia’s board of directors at a board meeting held later that same day.

On June 8, 2016, Mr. Ballin updated the Executive Committee as to his meeting with Mr. Weyerhaeuser, and Columbia’s interest
in a potential transaction with Pacific Continental and in entering into a non-disclosure agreement to conduct due diligence and
ascertain potential pricing for a transaction. The Executive Committee considered the request, but expressed concern as to timing and
the demands on senior management’s time, given the pending Foundation Bank transaction and integration work in process. At this
meeting, Mr. Busse also outlined the status of discussions currently underway with four other banks that were potential acquisition
targets of Pacific Continental. The Executive Committee determined to refer Columbia’s interest in a potential transaction to the full
Pacific Continental board of directors for consideration at its next regularly scheduled board meeting.

On June 13, 2016, Mr. Busse spoke by telephone with representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP,
Pacific Continental’s corporate legal counsel, which we refer to as Pillsbury, to advise them of Columbia’s interest in a potential
transaction with Pacific Continental and to request their participation at the Pacific Continental board of directors meeting scheduled
for July 19, 2016, when the matter would be discussed.

At its meeting on June 14, 2016, the Pacific Continental board of directors was advised of the growing interest of Columbia in a
potential transaction with Pacific Continental. After discussion, Mr. Busse was instructed to continue informal discussions with
Ms. Dressel. Mr. Busse agreed to arrange a follow-up meeting with Ms. Dressel later in June 2016, with the goal to prepare for a
thorough discussion of Columbia’s interest in a transaction with Pacific Continental and its strategic rationale at the Pacific Continental
board of director’s meeting scheduled for July 19, 2016.

On June 20, 2016, Pacific Continental announced it was planning to raise $35 million in subordinated debt to help fund future
acquisitions, including its pending acquisition of Foundation Bank. The Columbia board of directors was kept apprised and continued
to evaluate Pacific Continental’s debt offering and its pending acquisition of Foundation Bank in executive sessions in June, July and
August 2016.

On June 28, 2016, Ms. Dressel and Mr. Busse spoke by telephone. Mr. Busse indicated to Ms. Dressel that further discussions
were not materially beneficial without a general idea of potential valuation and synergies, and that Pacific Continental was still focused
on its acquisition and growth strategies. Ms. Dressel indicated that only a non-disclosure agreement would allow for the exchange of
information that would provide sufficient detail to enable potential valuation estimates. Mr. Busse and Ms. Dressel discussed next
steps. Mr. Busse indicated to Ms. Dressel that, at the request of the Pacific Continental board of directors and the Executive
Committee, representatives of Davidson would be making a presentation on the potential synergies and value to shareholders at the
Pacific Continental board of directors’ next meeting. Following the Pacific Continental board of director’s review of this information,
which would include metrics on Pacific Continental remaining independent, and assuming continued positive progress on the
Foundation Bank acquisition and integration process, it would evaluate the merits of entering into a non-disclosure agreement with
Columbia.

On July 19, 2016, the Pacific Continental board of directors held a meeting, also attended by representatives of Davidson and
Pillsbury, to discuss the state of the bank equity market, the acquisition landscape and potential

bank acquisition candidates. At this meeting, the Pacific Continental board of directors also discussed the interest expressed by
Columbia in a potential business combination and the synergies, rationale and financial metrics associated with the possible
transaction. Following a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of a potential transaction with Columbia, as well as the strategic
and financial benefits and risks of Pacific Continental remaining independent, the Pacific Continental board of directors authorized
senior management to negotiate and enter into a mutual non-disclosure agreement with Columbia to facilitate the exchange of
information.

In order to facilitate further transaction discussions, on July 27, 2016, Pacific Continental and Columbia entered into a mutual
non-disclosure agreement. An initial due diligence request list was provided to Pacific Continental on July 28, 2016, and an electronic
data room was established on or around August 8, 2016; the parties commenced their respective diligence, which continued until the
transaction was publicly announced on January 9, 2017.

On August 2, 2016, while attending a community banking investor conference in New York City, Mr. Busse and Ms. Dressel met
to outline a theoretical agenda for a comprehensive due diligence meeting scheduled to be held the following week, on August 11,
2016, in the Seattle area.

On August 11, 2016, members of executive management of each of Pacific Continental and Columbia, together with
representatives of Davidson and KBW, met at the Sea-Tac Conference Center to discuss the respective companies’ financial results,
business models, credit processes, niche segments, management/cultural strengths and growth outlook, as well as potential integration
of the two banks if a business combination were to occur, and a possible transaction timeline. An additional due diligence request list
was provided by Columbia.

From early August 2016 through January 9, 2017, Pacific Continental and Columbia engaged in a thorough mutual due diligence
process. In furtherance of these diligence efforts, each party conducted a review of the other’s loan and investment portfolios, reviewed
the other’s funding and liquidity policies and deposit accounts and conducted interviews with members of the other party’s executive
management team. Throughout this time, Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s executive management teams and members of Pacific
Continental’s Executive Committee and Columbia’s M&A Committee separately convened for periodic meetings regarding the
potential transaction and the status of the diligence process. In addition, at various times starting in June 2016 through January 9, 2017,
Davidson and KBW held discussions regarding potential valuation and synergies on behalf of Pacific Continental and Columbia,
respectively.

On August 12, 2016, Mr. Busse provided an update to the Pacific Continental board of directors regarding the August 11, 2016
meeting between executive management of the two companies and the progress of due diligence to date.

On August 17, 2016, Pacific Continental formally engaged Davidson on an exclusive basis to render financial advisory and
investment banking services to Pacific Continental in connection with the possible sale of the company.

On August 24, 2016, the Columbia M&A Committee met to discuss Columbia’s plans for Pacific Continental executives
following a potential transaction, Pacific Continental’s business and the drafting of a non-binding letter of interest.

On September 2, 2016, the Executive Committee met with Mr. Busse to discuss the exchange of information between Pacific
Continental and Columbia. Representatives of Davidson attended the meeting by telephone to discuss the results of diligence to date
and its discussions with KBW regarding potential valuation and synergies. Also in attendance, by teleconference, was a representative
of Pillsbury. Mr. Busse had been told by Ms. Dressel that, based on their due diligence to date, Columbia would be sending Pacific
Continental a non-binding letter of interest soon. Mr. Busse recommended that the Executive Committee meet on September 9, 2016,
to receive a presentation on any proposal received. The Executive Committee agreed, and a special meeting of the Executive
Committee was scheduled for that date.

On September 8, 2016, the Columbia board of directors held a special meeting to discuss the proposed non-binding letter of
interest. Following discussion, Ms. Dressel sent the non-binding letter of interest to Pacific Continental. The letter of interest proposed
a strategic merger between the two companies, the terms of which provided for Pacific Continental shareholders to receive, in
exchange for their Pacific Continental common shares, 90% Columbia common shares and 10% cash, or approximately 13,070,871
Columbia common shares and a fixed cash component of approximately $47.4 million. Based on Columbia’s closing price per share on
September 6, 2016, of $32.66, the transaction would have resulted in total consideration of $484.4 million, or $21.00 per Pacific
Continental common share. This fixed share structure, with an implied exchange ratio of 0.5787, represented a 25.4% market premium
over Pacific Continental’s closing price on September 6, 2016, of $16.75. The non-binding letter of interest also proposed that one
current community-based director of Pacific Continental be nominated for appointment to the Columbia board of directors effective
upon the closing of the transaction.

The Executive Committee of the Pacific Continental board of directors met the next day, on September 9, 2016, to discuss the
non-binding letter of interest received from Columbia. Also present were members of executive management of Pacific Continental.
Participating by telephone were representatives of Davidson, who outlined the proposed terms of the non-binding letter of interest, and
a representative of Pillsbury. Davidson outlined the financial metrics of the proposed offer and the potential value to shareholders of a
combination with Columbia. The Executive Committee discussed the specific terms of the non-binding letter of interest, and, in
particular, the pricing structure, potential price protection mechanisms, market reaction, board representation, as well as impacts on
Pacific Continental’s employees and communities and Pacific Continental’s anticipated results on a stand-alone basis. The Executive
Committee also considered Columbia’s franchise value and potential synergies with Pacific Continental. After further discussion, the
Executive Committee determined to refer the non-binding letter of interest to the full Pacific Continental board of directors for review
and consideration at its meeting on September 20, 2016. Davidson was asked to prepare a presentation modeling the transaction pricing
and structure and analyzing recent deal metrics for comparison, and to clarify certain terms of the non-binding letter of interest with
KBW prior to the September 20, 2016, meeting of the Pacific Continental board of directors. Mr. Busse stated that, at that meeting,
senior management would provide Pacific Continental’s 2017-19 financial outlook and anticipated financial results as an independent
organization for comparative purposes. The Executive Committee also unanimously agreed to invite Ms. Dressel to address the Pacific
Continental board of directors at its September 20, 2016, meeting.

On September 20, 2016, the Pacific Continental board of directors met to discuss the non-binding letter of interest received from
Columbia. Davidson attended the meeting, and participating by telephone were representatives of Pillsbury. Mr. Busse presented
management’s three-year financial outlook and anticipated financial results as an independent bank. The Pillsbury representative made
a presentation to the Pacific Continental board of directors regarding the fiduciary duties of directors in connection with a business
combination. Davidson outlined the terms offered by Columbia, price modeling and valuation, using a discounted valuation for
comparative purposes. After thorough discussion, Mr. Busse invited Ms. Dressel to join the meeting, and she made a formal
presentation to the Pacific Continental board of directors regarding Columbia and answered various questions from directors. After
Ms. Dressel was excused, the Pacific Continental board of directors then further discussed the terms of the non-binding letter of
interest. Mr. Busse voluntarily stepped out of the room for a portion of the meeting to allow full discussion by all of the independent
directors. Mr. Busse was invited back into the full meeting for final discussion and voting. The Pacific Continental board of directors
discussed the specific terms of the non-binding letter of interest, and, in particular, pricing and potential price protection, the potential
impacts on Pacific Continental’s employees and communities, severance and benefits, proposed deal protection terms, anticipated
market reaction, board representation and expectations regarding Pacific Continental’s anticipated results on a stand-alone basis.
Following lengthy discussions and analysis of the transaction, the Pacific Continental board of directors, by majority vote, determined
that it was in the best interests of Pacific Continental and its shareholders to proceed with negotiations and further diligence regarding
the proposed merger, subject to the further negotiation of the non-binding letter of interest by Mr. Busse with the assistance of legal
counsel and Davidson, and the possible improvement in certain of the offered terms, including the price per share, price protection,
deal protection terms and severance benefits for affected employees.

On or around September 21, 2016, Pacific Continental revised the non-binding letter of interest to reflect their proposed changes,
including a revision to the proposed fixed share structure such that each Pacific Continental common share would receive 0.5919 of a
Columbia common share and $2.15 per share in cash, or $21.50 per share (based on Columbia’s closing price on September 20, 2016
of $32.69). In addition, the mark-up proposed a price protection mechanism in the form of a collar, additional severance benefits for
affected employees of Pacific Continental, a second Columbia board of directors seat, a reduced termination fee and clarification
regarding certain closing conditions. This draft was circulated to the Executive Committee on September 21, 2016, and discussed at a
meeting of the Executive Committee held on September 22, 2016, at which representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury participated by
teleconference. A revised non-binding letter of interest was sent by Davidson to KBW on September 22, 2016, as instructed by the
Pacific Continental Executive Committee.

On September 24, 2016, a further revised non-binding letter of interest was received by Davidson from KBW. While accepting
many of the changes proposed by Pacific Continental on September 22, 2016, including a compromise on severance benefits and a
reduction in the termination fee, this revised draft of the non-binding letter of interest provided that Pacific Continental shareholders
would receive 0.5787 of a Columbia common share and $2.10 per share in cash for each Pacific Continental common share
outstanding. In the aggregate, this translated into Pacific Continental shareholders receiving approximately 13,070,871 Columbia
common shares, plus a fixed cash component in the amount of approximately $47.4 million. Columbia also proposed a cap on the
exchange ratio if Columbia’s average share price reached $37.56, and a termination right if Columbia’s average share price fell below
$26.94, with a Pacific Continental right to reinstate with an exchange ratio of 0.5962 and $2.10 per share in cash for each Pacific
Continental common share outstanding. This offer represented a market premium of 29.1% over Pacific Continental’s closing price on
September 23, 2016, of $16.44.

On September 26, 2016, the Executive Committee met to discuss the revised non-binding letter of interest received from
Columbia. Participating by telephone were representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury. On the basis of discussions among members of
executive management, Executive Committee members and representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury, Pacific Continental proposed
further changes to the non-binding letter of interest, including, among other matters, further clarification regarding the collar
mechanism. This revised non-binding letter of interest was sent by Davidson to KBW on September 26, 2016.

Later that same day, on September 26, 2016, a further revised non-binding letter of interest was received by Davidson from KBW.
This further revised non-binding letter of interest proposed that Columbia and Pacific Continental should each have the right to
terminate the transaction if Columbia’s average share price were to fall below $26.13 (subject to Pacific Continental’s right to reinstate
at an exchange ratio of 0.5787 and $3.05 per share in cash).

Also on September 26, 2016, the Columbia M&A Committee and the Columbia board of directors met and were provided with
updates regarding the discussions with Pacific Continental.

On September 28, 2016, the Executive Committee met to discuss the latest draft of the non-binding letter of interest.
Representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury attended this meeting by teleconference. After extensive discussion of the specific terms of
the non-binding letter of interest, and, in particular, the adjustments to the price protection mechanism, and an updated presentation
from Davidson regarding the financial metrics of the proposed transaction, the Executive Committee determined that it would be in
best interests of Pacific Continental and its shareholders to enter into the non-binding letter of interest with Columbia. In reaching this
determination, the Executive Committee considered the significant market premium implied by Columbia’s offer and the strength of
Columbia’s market presence, its financial condition and its good standing with regulators. The Executive Committee unanimously
approved the execution of the non-binding letter of interest received from Columbia and instructed senior management and Pacific
Continental’s advisors to proceed with further diligence, evaluations and negotiations with respect to the proposed strategic transaction.

On September 29, 2016, Mr. Busse executed the non-binding letter of interest and returned it to Columbia, and a detailed reverse
due diligence request list was sent to KBW by Davidson.

During October and November 2016, representatives of Pacific Continental, Pillsbury, Columbia, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP,
Columbia’s corporate legal counsel, which we refer to as Sullivan & Cromwell, and other third party advisors conducted due diligence
with respect to each of Pacific Continental and Columbia, including in respect of credit matters, executive compensation matters,
regulatory relationships and compliance, certain litigation matters and related developments and other general corporate matters. On
October 26, 2016, the Columbia board of directors, during an executive session at a regularly scheduled meeting, was briefed with
respect to the draft definitive agreement prepared by Sullivan & Cromwell and the due diligence that Columbia and its advisors had
performed to date.

On October 27, 2016, Sullivan & Cromwell sent an initial draft of the merger agreement to Pillsbury. The details of this draft
were discussed among senior management of Pacific Continental, Davidson and Pillsbury on October 31, 2016, and, on November 3,
2016, a draft of the merger agreement was sent to the Executive Committee for its review and discussion.

On November 4, 2016, a special Executive Committee meeting was held to discuss the draft merger agreement. Participating by
telephone were representatives of Pillsbury and Davidson. Mr. Busse updated the Executive Committee on the status of discussions
with Columbia, and Pacific Continental’s legal counsel outlined for the Executive Committee the material terms of the agreement,
including structure, conditions to closing, operating covenants, employee benefits matters and timing. Following this meeting, on
November 4, 2016, Pillsbury sent a mark-up of the merger agreement draft to Sullivan & Cromwell.

On November 7, 2016, a special meeting of the Pacific Continental board of directors was held to update the directors on the
transaction and the status of diligence and reverse due diligence and to provide an overview of the merger agreement draft.
Participating by telephone were representatives of Pillsbury and Davidson. Mr. Busse updated the Pacific Continental board of
directors on the status of discussions with Columbia, and legal counsel outlined for the Pacific Continental board of directors the
material terms of the agreement, including structure, conditions to closing, operating covenants, employee benefits matters, the parties’
respective representations and warranties and timing.

During the ensuing nine weeks, representatives of Pacific Continental and Columbia, with the assistance of their respective legal
counsel and financial advisors, conducted negotiations regarding the terms of the merger agreement, holding a number of telephonic
meetings to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction and to negotiate acceptable final transaction documents, including, without
limitation, provisions relating to the scope of representations, warranties and covenants, the amount of termination fees and the
circumstances under which they would be paid and the terms under which Pacific Continental would be permitted to respond to certain
unsolicited alternative proposals. During the course of negotiations, the economic terms remained substantially consistent with the
terms outlined in the executed non-binding letter of interest.

During this period, Pacific Continental’s executive management team, members of the Executive Committee and representatives
of Pillsbury and Davidson convened on a regular basis to discuss the status of the due diligence process, plans for communications
with Pacific Continental’s staff, customers, shareholders and regulators and negotiation of the transaction terms.

The Executive Committee was updated regularly at its meetings conducted on November 14 and December 7, 2016. The Pacific
Continental board of directors was briefed on the status of the transaction and merger agreement negotiations on November 15, 2016.

On November 16, 2016, the Columbia board of directors was updated on the results of due diligence by Columbia management,
including in respect of ongoing developments in certain Pacific Continental litigation,

various contractual and employee matters, financial performance and others. At this meeting, the Columbia board of directors also
discussed the anticipated next steps in the transaction.

On November 27, 2016, the exclusivity period provided for in the non-binding letter of interest expired. In light of the progress
made in continuing negotiations, both Pacific Continental and Columbia verbally agreed to extend the exclusivity period to allow for
continued negotiations of the definitive agreement and ancillary agreements and continued due diligence by each party, including with
respect to ongoing developments in certain Pacific Continental litigation and potential resolutions of that litigation. An extension of the
exclusivity period until December 15, 2016, was formally agreed to in writing by Pacific Continental and Columbia on November 30,
2016.

In the week that followed, representatives of Pacific Continental and Columbia, with the assistance of their respective legal
counsel and financial advisors, continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and ancillary agreements, with particular
emphasis on certain benefits and severance matters.

On December 8, 2016, KBW contacted Davidson regarding a proposed alternative pricing structure for the transaction, which
would provide for 100% stock consideration and an exchange ratio, fixed within the collar, of 0.6430. The exchange ratio was set based
on Columbia’s common share price of $32.66 as of September 6, 2016 and Columbia’s first offer to Pacific Continental at that time of
$21.00 per share. The collar was updated for the newly proposed structure. If Columbia’s average closing price were above $37.56, the
exchange ratio would float if Columbia’s average closing price outperformed the average price of the KBW Index for the determination
period, in each case measured from the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by 15 percentage points and would be set
at $24.151 divided by Columbia’s average closing price. If Columbia’s average closing price were below $27.76 and if Columbia’s
average closing price underperformed the average price of the KBW Index for the determination period, in each case measured from
the price on the agreed upon date of September 6, 2016, by more than 15 percentage points, the price would fix at $17.850 and the
“fill” could be made up of a higher exchange ratio or cash, at Columbia’s option. Below $26.13, there would still be a termination right
for both sides, and, if Columbia chose to terminate, then Pacific Continental could have the transaction reinstated with an exchange
ratio of 0.6430 plus $1.048 per share in cash. Based on the closing price of Columbia common shares as of December 14, 2016, of
$43.43, this proposed change in the form of consideration increased the per share consideration payable to Pacific Continental
shareholders from $27.23 to $27.93, representing an approximately $16.2 million aggregate increase in merger consideration payable.
In light of the post-election increase in banking sector stocks, including the price of Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s common
shares, Columbia proposed that the transaction consideration be changed to 100% common shares. The reasons for this proposed
change in the form of merger consideration were the resulting improvements in certain transaction metrics, including regulatory capital
ratios. That same day, Mr. Busse and Ms. Dressel discussed this alternative pricing structure, as well as the potential impact on
transaction timing.

During December 2016, the parties and their representatives continued to conduct due diligence with respect to each other,
including Pacific Continental’s reverse due diligence with respect to Columbia’s regulatory relationships and compliance program and
Columbia’s due diligence with respect to ongoing developments in Pacific Continental litigation, as well as various integration and
third party contractual matters. On December 9, 2016, the parties agreed to further extend the exclusivity period until January 10, 2017,
in order to provide adequate time to complete these due diligence efforts as well as to monitor the developments with respect to the
expected settlement of certain Pacific Continental litigation and to take into account the timing of related court approvals, and to allow
further time to evaluate and consider the proposed change in pricing structure.

On December 14, 2016, the Columbia board of directors met to discuss, among other things, the progress of the transaction
negotiations and due diligence and the proposal for the merger consideration to be 100% Columbia common shares.

On December 15, 2016, the Executive Committee met to discuss Columbia’s 100% common share proposal. Also present were
members of executive management, and representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury. Davidson

outlined the proposed change in the form of consideration and details of the collar mechanism. After extensive discussion regarding
valuation multiples, the status and findings of reverse due diligence, anticipated year-end results of both companies and transaction
timing, the Executive Committee agreed to recommend this change in the form of merger consideration for the Pacific Continental
board of directors’ consideration at its next meeting.

On December 20, 2016, the Pacific Continental board of directors met in executive session to discuss the proposed change in the
form of merger consideration, as well as other matters related to transaction progress. Also present were members of executive
management, and representatives of Davidson and Pillsbury. Davidson outlined the proposed change in the form of consideration and
the reasons underlying the proposed change. Based on December 14, 2016 closing prices, the change to 100% stock consideration
increased the per share consideration payable to Pacific Continental shareholders from $27.23 per share under the previous 90% stock /
10% cash structure to $27.93 per share. Davidson then summarized recent bank merger transactions and metrics and noted that the
proposed transaction represented the highest price/tangible book value bank transaction announced since 2007 for a bank with assets of
$1.0 billion or greater. The directors then discussed the proposed change in the form of consideration, the factors driving the increases
in bank stocks, the potential for fluctuation in the value of the consideration between signing and closing and the assumptions used in
Davidson’s analysis. Following further discussion regarding the merits of the proposed change in form of merger consideration, the
Pacific Continental board of directors approved the change in the merger consideration.

Over the course of the ensuing weeks, representatives of Pacific Continental and Columbia, with the assistance of their respective
legal counsel and financial advisors, continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and ancillary agreements. Pacific
Continental and Columbia also continued their due diligence efforts.

On January 7, 2017, the engagement letter between Davidson and Pacific Continental was revised to clarify that the aggregate
compensation payable to Davidson thereunder upon closing of a transaction shall in no event cause Pacific Continental’s transaction
expenses to exceed the $14.5 million threshold provided for in the merger agreement.

On January 9, 2017, a special meeting of the Pacific Continental board of directors was held. Representatives of Davidson and
Pillsbury also participated. Davidson and Pillsbury outlined the extensive negotiations that had taken place and explained the merger
consideration to be received by the Pacific Continental shareholders. The Pacific Continental board of directors discussed the fact that,
given the appreciation in Columbia’s share price, the fixed exchange ratio of 0.6430 would result in per share consideration for Pacific
Continental shareholders of $28.50, based on Columbia’s closing price on January 6, 2017 of $44.33, and the performance of
Columbia’s share price within the 15% collar. The closing price of Pacific Continental common shares on the last business day before
this meeting, January 6, 2017, was $20.95 per share. At this meeting, Davidson reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed
transactions and rendered to the Pacific Continental board of directors an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Davidson,
as set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed mergers was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Pacific
Continental common shares. Pillsbury then reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties under applicable law to Pacific
Continental’s shareholders, as well as terms of the merger agreement and the related voting and non-competition agreements to be
entered into in connection therewith, copies of each of which had been delivered to the directors in advance of the meeting. The Pacific
Continental board of directors then engaged in a discussion of the terms of the agreements and the representatives of Pillsbury and
Davidson answered their questions. After extensive discussion, and taking into account the factors described below in greater detail,
the Pacific Continental board of directors adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby.

Also on January 9, 2017, a special meeting of the Columbia board of directors was held. Representatives of KBW and Sullivan &
Cromwell also participated. KBW and Sullivan & Cromwell summarized the extensive negotiations that had taken place and reviewed
the merger consideration to be received by the Pacific Continental

shareholders. The Columbia board of directors discussed the fixed exchange ratio of 0.6430 that would result in per share consideration
for Pacific Continental shareholders of $28.50, based on Columbia’s closing price on January 6, 2017 of $44.33, and the performance
of Columbia’s share price within the 15% collar. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed transaction and
rendered to the Columbia board of directors an oral opinion (later confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of such date and subject to
the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW
as set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed first merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Columbia.
Sullivan & Cromwell then reviewed with the Columbia directors their fiduciary duties under applicable law. Following this review,
Sullivan & Cromwell outlined for the directors the terms of the merger agreement and the related voting agreements to be entered into
in connection therewith, copies of each of which had been delivered to the directors in advance of the meeting. The Columbia board of
directors then engaged in a discussion of the terms of the agreements and the representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and KBW
answered their various questions. After extensive discussion and taking into account the factors described below in greater detail, the
Columbia board of directors adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby.

Following the Pacific Continental and Columbia boards of directors meetings, the terms of the merger agreement and related
agreements were finalized, and the agreements were executed and delivered and the transaction announced on the evening of
January 9, 2017, in a press release jointly issued by Pacific Continental and Columbia. Based on a $43.31 per share closing price of
Columbia common shares on January 9, 2017, the aggregate consideration for Pacific Continental was approximately $644.1 million,
or $27.85 per share.

Recommendations of the Columbia Board of Directors and Reasons for the Mergers

In reaching its decision to adopt and approve the merger agreement and recommend that Columbia shareholders approve the
Columbia share issuance proposal, the Columbia board of directors evaluated the mergers in consultation with Columbia’s
management, as well as Columbia’s legal and financial advisors, and considered a number of factors, including:
 

 

•  its knowledge of Columbia’s business, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings and prospects, and of Pacific
Continental’s business, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings and prospects, taking into account the
presentations made by Pacific Continental officers, the results of Columbia’s due diligence review of Pacific Continental and
information provided by Pacific Continental’s financial advisor;

 

 

•  its knowledge of the current environment in the financial services industry, including national, regional and local economic
conditions and the interest rate environment, continued consolidation, increased operating costs resulting from regulatory
initiatives and compliance mandates, increasing nationwide and global competition, the current environment for community
banks, particularly in the Northwest, and current financial market conditions and the likely effects of these factors on the
companies’ potential growth, development, productivity and strategic options, and the historical market prices of Pacific
Continental common shares;

 

 
•  its belief that combining the two companies would create a larger and more diversified financial institution that is both better

equipped to respond to economic and industry developments and better positioned to develop and build on its strong market
share in Oregon, Washington, and the Northwest;

 

 
•  the complementary aspects of Pacific Continental’s and Columbia’s businesses, including customer focus, geographic

coverage, business orientation and compatibility of the companies’ management and operating styles;
 

 
•  its understanding of Pacific Continental’s commitment to enhancing the strategic position of the combined company in the

Northwest;
 

 
•  the potential expense-saving and revenue-enhancing opportunities in connection with the mergers and the related potential

impact on the combined company’s earnings;

•  Columbia’s successful operating and acquisition track record, specifically Columbia’s history of efficiently closing and
integrating acquisitions, and Columbia’s board of directors’ belief that the combined enterprise would benefit from
Columbia’s ability to take advantage of economies of scale and grow in the current economic environment, making Pacific
Continental an attractive partner for Columbia;

 

 
•  its assessment of the likelihood that the mergers would be completed in a timely manner and that the management team of

the combined company would be able to successfully integrate and operate the businesses of the combined company after
the mergers;

 

 

•  the financial presentation, dated January 9, 2017, of KBW to the Columbia board of directors and the opinion, dated
January 9, 2017, of KBW to the Columbia board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, to Columbia of the exchange ratio in the proposed first merger, as more fully described below under
“Opinion of Columbia’s Financial Advisor;”

 

 
•  the structure of the mergers and the terms of the merger agreement, including the fact that Pacific Continental shareholders

would receive Columbia common shares except in the limited circumstances that a per share cash amount may be included
in the merger consideration, the no-solicitation and shareholder approval covenants and the termination fee provisions;

 

 
•  the expectation that the first merger and the subsequent merger taken together as a single integrated transaction would

qualify as a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the mergers and the likelihood that such approvals would be

received in a timely manner and without unacceptable conditions; and
 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational

matters while working to implement the mergers.

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Columbia board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but,
rather, includes the material factors considered by the Columbia board of directors. In reaching its decision to adopt and approve the
merger agreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Columbia board of directors did not quantify
or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The Columbia board of directors considered all these factors as a whole and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to
support, its determination.

For the reasons set forth above, the Columbia board of directors determined that the mergers, the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Columbia and its
shareholders, and approved and adopted the merger agreement. The Columbia board of directors recommends that the
Columbia shareholders vote “FOR” the Columbia share issuance proposal and “FOR” the Columbia adjournment proposal.

Recommendations of the Pacific Continental Board of Directors and Reasons for the Mergers

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Pacific Continental board
of directors evaluated the merger agreement in consultation with executive management, as well as its legal counsel and financial
advisor, and considered numerous factors, including the following:
 

 

•  information with respect to Pacific Continental’s business, earnings, operations, financial condition, asset quality and
prospects, and information with respect to Columbia’s business, earnings, operations, financial condition, asset quality and
prospects, taking into account the presentations made by Pacific Continental’s officers, the results of Pacific Continental’s
due diligence review of Columbia and information provided by Pacific Continental’s financial advisor;

•  its knowledge of the current environment in the financial services industry, including national, regional and local economic
conditions and the interest rate environment, continued consolidation, the uncertainties in the regulatory climate for financial
institutions, increased operating costs resulting from regulatory initiatives and compliance mandates, including increasing
capital requirements, increasing competition, the current environment for community banks, particularly in the Northwest,
and current financial market conditions and the likely effects of these factors on the companies’ potential growth,
development, productivity and strategic options and the historical market prices of Pacific Continental common shares;

 

 
•  its belief that combining the two companies would create a larger and more diversified financial institution that is both better

equipped to respond to economic and industry developments and better positioned to develop and build on its existing
market position in the Northwest;

 

 
•  the complementary aspects of Pacific Continental’s and Columbia’s businesses, including customer focus, geographic

coverage, business orientation and compatibility of the companies’ cultures and management and operating styles;
 

 

•  the fact that the merger consideration consists entirely of Columbia common shares, except in the limited circumstances that
a per share cash amount may be included in the merger consideration, giving former Pacific Continental shareholders the
opportunity to participate as Columbia shareholders in the benefits of the combination and the future performance of the
combined company generally;

 

 
•  the potential expense-saving and revenue-enhancing opportunities in connection with the mergers and the related potential

impact on the combined company’s earnings;
 

 •  Columbia’s successful track record, including, among other things, with respect to the integration of acquisitions;
 

 
•  its assessment of the likelihood that the mergers would be completed in a timely manner and that the management team of

the combined company would be able to successfully integrate and operate the businesses of the combined company after
the mergers;

 

 
•  the fact that the Pacific Continental board of directors is permitted to change its recommendation that the Pacific Continental

shareholders approve the merger agreement in certain circumstances;
 

 
•  the expectation that the first merger and the subsequent merger taken together as a single integrated transaction would

qualify as a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the Pacific Continental board of directors’ belief that the merger consideration exceeds Pacific Continental’s likely value in

the absence of a merger, including its potential for future growth, which belief was based on a number of factors, including:
 

 
•  the risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining Pacific Continental’s performance as a stand-alone company;

and
 

 •  the Pacific Continental board of directors’ analysis of other strategic alternatives available to Pacific Continental;
 

 
•  the greater market capitalization and anticipated trading liquidity of Columbia common shares after the transaction in the

event Pacific Continental shareholders desire to sell the Columbia common shares to be received by them upon completion
of the mergers;

 

 

•  the financial analyses presented by Davidson to the Pacific Continental board of directors and the opinion, dated January 9,
2017, delivered by Davidson to the Pacific Continental board of directors to the effect that, as of that date, and subject to and
based on the qualifications and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Pacific Continental common shares, as more fully described below under “—Opinion of Pacific
Continental’s Financial Advisor”;

•  the terms of the merger agreement, including the exchange ratio, price protection mechanisms, deal protection and
termination fee provisions, conditions to closing and the restrictions on the conduct of the business of both companies
between the date of the merger agreement and the effective date of the mergers, which it reviewed with its outside legal and
financial advisors, which terms are described more fully under “The Merger Agreement”;

 

 
•  the need to obtain approval by shareholders of Pacific Continental and Columbia, as well as regulatory approvals, in order to

complete the transaction and the risk that those or other conditions will not be satisfied;
 

 
•  the risks associated with the operations of the combined company including the challenges both of integrating Pacific

Continental’s business, operations and employees with those of Columbia and of achieving the anticipated cost savings;
 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational

matters while working to implement the mergers; and
 

 
•  the fact that some of the directors and officers of Pacific Continental have interests in the mergers and have arrangements

that are different from or in addition to those of Pacific Continental shareholders generally.

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Pacific Continental board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive,
but, rather, includes the material factors considered by the Pacific Continental board of directors. In reaching its decision to adopt and
approve the merger agreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Pacific Continental board of
directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different
weights to different factors. The Pacific Continental board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions
with, and questioning of, Pacific Continental’s management and its financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be
favorable to, and to support, its determination. The Pacific Continental board of directors also relied on the experience of Davidson, its
financial advisor, for analyses of the financial terms of the mergers and for its opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view,
of the exchange ratio to the shareholders of Pacific Continental.

For the reasons set forth above, the Pacific Continental board of directors determined that the mergers, the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Pacific
Continental and its shareholders, and approved and adopted the merger agreement. The Pacific Continental board of directors
recommends that the Pacific Continental shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related named
executive officer compensation proposal, and “FOR” the Pacific Continental adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Columbia’s Financial Advisor

Columbia engaged KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Columbia, including an opinion to the
Columbia board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Columbia of the exchange ratio in the proposed first
merger. Columbia selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in
transactions similar to the mergers. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of
financial services businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the Columbia board of directors held on January 9,
2017, at which the Columbia board of directors evaluated the proposed mergers. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects
of the proposed mergers and rendered an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the
exchange ratio in the proposed

first merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Columbia. The Columbia board of directors approved the merger agreement at
this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is
attached as Appendix D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the
opinion.

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the
Columbia board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the mergers.
The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the first merger to Columbia. It
did not address the underlying business decision of Columbia to engage in the mergers or enter into the merger agreement or
constitute a recommendation to the Columbia board of directors in connection with the mergers, and it does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Columbia common shares or any shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in
connection with the mergers or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such
shareholder should enter into a voting, shareholders’, affiliates’ or other agreement with respect to the mergers or exercise any
dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder.

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and
procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of Columbia and Pacific Continental and bearing upon the mergers, including, among other things:
 

 •  a draft of the merger agreement, dated January 4, 2017 (the most recent draft then made available to KBW);
 

 
•  the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2015,

of Columbia;
 

 
•  the unaudited quarterly financial statements and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31,

2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, of Columbia;
 

 
•  the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2015,

of Pacific Continental;
 

 
•  the unaudited quarterly financial statements and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31,

2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, of Pacific Continental;
 

 
•  certain regulatory filings of Columbia and Pacific Continental and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly

reports on Form FRY-9C and quarterly call reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended
December 31, 2015, and the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016;

 

 
•  certain other interim reports and other communications of Columbia and Pacific Continental to their respective shareholders;

and
 

 
•  other financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Columbia and Pacific Continental

furnished to KBW by Columbia and Pacific Continental or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of its
analysis.

Table of Contents

KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to
its analyses included, among others, the following:
 

 •  the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Columbia and Pacific Continental;
 

 •  the assets and liabilities of Columbia and Pacific Continental;
 

 •  the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;
 

 
•  a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Columbia and Pacific Continental with similar

information for certain other companies, the securities of which were publicly traded;
 

 

•  publicly-available consensus “street estimates” of Pacific Continental, as well as assumed Pacific Continental long term
growth rates provided to KBW by Columbia management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by such
management and used and relied upon by KBW, based on such discussions, at the direction of Columbia management and
with the consent of the Columbia board of directors;

 

 
•  publicly-available consensus “street estimates” of Columbia, as well as assumed Columbia long term growth rates provided

to KBW by Columbia management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by such management and used and
relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Columbia board of directors; and

 

 

•  estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the mergers on Columbia (including without limitation the cost
savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the mergers) that were prepared by Columbia
management, provided to and discussed with KBW by such management, and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction
of such management and with the consent of the Columbia board of directors.

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general
economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well as its experience in securities valuation and
knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions that were held by managements of Columbia and
Pacific Continental regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of
each of their respective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information that was provided to it or that was publicly available and did not independently verify the accuracy or
completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW
relied upon the management of Columbia as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street
estimates” of Columbia and Pacific Continental (and the assumed long-term growth rates of Columbia and Pacific Continental)
referred to above that were provided to or otherwise discussed with KBW by such management, and that in each case KBW was
directed by such management to use. KBW further relied upon such management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the
estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the mergers on Columbia (including, without limitation, the cost savings and
related expenses expected to result or be derived from the mergers) referred to above. KBW assumed, at the direction of Columbia, that
all of the foregoing information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting, or in the case of the Columbia and Pacific Continental
publicly available “street estimates” referred to above that such estimates were consistent with, the best currently available estimates
and judgments of Columbia management, and that the forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information would be
realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated. The financial and operating forecasts, projections and estimates of Pacific
Continental that KBW was directed by Columbia management to use reflected differences from the forecasts, projections and estimates
that were prepared by Pacific Continental and provided to Columbia.

Accordingly, with the consent of Columbia, in rendering its opinion, KBW’s reliance upon Columbia management as to the
reasonableness and achievability of such information included reliance upon the judgments and assessments of Columbia and
Columbia management with respect to such differences.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Columbia and Pacific Continental that was provided to
KBW was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of Columbia and Pacific Continental referred to above that KBW was directed to use, was based
on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic
and competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW
assumed, based on discussions with the respective managements of Columbia and Pacific Continental and with the consent of the
Columbia board of directors, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW could form its opinion, and KBW
expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all such information without
independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness
thereof.

KBW assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of either Columbia or Pacific Continental since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made
available to KBW and that KBW was directed to use. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy of
allowances for loan and lease losses, and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with Columbia’s consent, that the
aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for each of Columbia and Pacific Continental are adequate to cover such losses. In
rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Columbia or Pacific Continental, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities or the
collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial
capability or fair value of Columbia or Pacific Continental under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices
at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, KBW assumed no
responsibility or liability for their accuracy. With respect to any litigation to which Pacific Continental is or has been a party, KBW
relied upon the assessments of Columbia’s management and counsel as to all matters relating to such litigation and have assumed,
without verification, that there will be no developments that would be material to KBW’s analyses.

KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:
 

 

•  the mergers (including the bank merger) and any related transactions would be completed substantially in accordance with
the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any respect material
to its analyses from the latest draft version of the merger agreement that had been reviewed by KBW) with no adjustments to
the exchange ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of the Pacific Continental common shares;

 

 
•  the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments

referred to in the merger agreement were true and correct;
 

 
•  each party to the merger agreement or any of the related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements

required to be performed by such party under such documents;
 

 

•  that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental
approval for the mergers (including the bank merger) or any related transactions and that all conditions to the completion of
the mergers (including the bank merger) and any related transactions would be satisfied without any waivers or
modifications to the merger agreement or any of the related documents; and

 

 
•  in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual or other consents or approvals for the mergers (including the

bank merger) and any related transactions, no restrictions, including any divestiture

requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a material
adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Columbia, Pacific Continental or the pro forma
entity or the contemplated benefits of the mergers, including the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be
derived from the mergers.

KBW assumed that the mergers would be consummated in a manner that complied with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. KBW was further advised by
representatives of Columbia that Columbia relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all
legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Columbia, Merger Sub, Pacific Continental, the
mergers (including the bank merger) and any related transaction) and the merger agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect
to any such matters.

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, of the exchange ratio in
the first merger to Columbia. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the mergers (including the bank
merger) or any term or aspect of any related transaction, including without limitation, the form or structure of the mergers (including
the bank merger) or any related transaction, any consequences of the mergers to Columbia, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or
any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, retention, consulting, voting, support, cooperation, shareholder or other
agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the mergers, any related transaction or
otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of such opinion
and the information made available to KBW through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW’s opinion may have
affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to update, revise
or reaffirm its opinion. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with respect to:
 

 •  the underlying business decision of Columbia to engage in the mergers or enter into the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the relative merits of the mergers as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or

contemplated by Columbia or the Columbia board of directors;
 

 
•  any business, operational or other plans with respect to Pacific Continental or the pro forma entity that may be currently

contemplated by Columbia or the Columbia board of directors or that may be made by Columbia or the Columbia board of
directors subsequent to the closing of the mergers;

 

 
•  the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Columbia’s officers, directors or employees, or any class

of such persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Columbia common shares or relative to the exchange ratio;
 

 
•  the effect of the mergers (including the bank merger) or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be

received by, holders of any class of securities of Columbia, Pacific Continental or any other party to any transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 •  any adjustment (as provided in the merger agreement) to the exchange ratio assumed for purposes of KBW’s opinion;
 

 

•  any payment of cash consideration in respect of the Pacific Continental common shares (as provided in the merger
agreement) in the event certain conditions as further described in the merger agreement are met, including without
limitation, in the event the respective conditions in connection therewith are so met, any election by Columbia to pay cash
consideration in lieu of an adjustment to the exchange ratio and any election by Pacific Continental to receive cash
consideration;

 

 
•  whether Columbia has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay any cash

consideration in respect of the Pacific Continental common shares (if applicable);
 

 •  the actual value of Columbia common shares to be issued in connection with the first merger;

•  the prices, trading range or volume at which Columbia common shares or Pacific Continental common shares will trade

following the public announcement of the mergers or the prices, trading range or volume at which Columbia common shares
will trade following the consummation of the mergers;

 

 
•  any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the mergers or any other transaction

contemplated by the merger agreement; or
 

 

•  any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Columbia, Pacific Continental, Merger Sub, any of their
respective shareholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the mergers (including the bank merger) or
any other related transaction, including whether or not the first merger and the subsequent merger taken together would
qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.

In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, Columbia and Pacific Continental. Any
estimates contained in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these
analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among several factors taken
into consideration by the Columbia board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the mergers.
Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Columbia board of directors
with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the first merger were determined
through negotiation between Columbia and Pacific Continental and the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of
the Columbia board of directors.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the Columbia board of directors in
connection with its opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the
presentation made by KBW to the Columbia board of directors, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in
connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic
process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its
analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the proposed mergers of
$659.4 million, or $28.50 per outstanding Pacific Continental common share, based on the 0.6430x exchange ratio in the proposed first
merger and the closing price of Columbia common shares on January 6, 2017. In addition to the financial analyses described below,
KBW reviewed with the Columbia board of directors for informational purposes, among other things, the implied transaction multiple
for the proposed mergers of 31.3x Pacific Continental’s estimated 2016 earnings per share, which we refer to as EPS, taken from
consensus “street estimates” of Pacific Continental, based on the implied transaction value for the proposed mergers of $28.50 per
outstanding Pacific Continental common share.

Columbia Selected Companies Analysis

Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial condition and market performance of
Columbia to 13 major exchange-traded banks and bank holding companies (referred to as the Columbia selected companies)
headquartered in the Western Region (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming) with total assets between $5.0 billion and $25.0 billion. Merger targets, savings banks/thrifts, ethnic-
focused banks and banks with negative earnings for the most recent completed quarter were excluded from the Columbia selected
companies.

The Columbia selected companies were as follows:
 
Umpqua Holdings Corporation   Banner Corporation
PacWest Bancorp   Glacier Bancorp, Inc.
First Hawaiian, Inc.
Western Alliance Bancorporation   

First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.
CVB Financial Corp.

Bank of Hawaii Corporation
Washington Federal, Inc.
Banc of California, Inc.   

Central Pacific Financial Corp.
Westamerica Bancorporation

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability data and other financial information for, as of, or, in the case of latest 12
months, which we refer to as LTM, information, through the most recently completed quarter, which we refer to as MRQ, ended
September 30, 2016, and market price information as of January 6, 2017. KBW also used 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates taken from
consensus “street estimates” for Columbia and the Columbia selected companies. Where consolidated holding company level financial
data for the Columbia selected companies was unreported, subsidiary bank level data was utilized to calculate ratios. Certain financial
data prepared by KBW, as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in Columbia’s historical
financial statements, or the data prepared by D.A. Davidson presented under the section “The Mergers—Opinion of Pacific
Continental’s Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial
data presented.

KBW’s analysis showed the following concerning the financial performance of Columbia and the Columbia selected companies:

For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction
consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company’s then latest publicly
available financial statements and, to the extent publicly available, next year EPS consensus “street estimates” prior to the
announcement of the respective transaction:
 

 
•  Price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private

acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM net income);
 

 

•  Price per common share to Core LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private
acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by Core LTM net
income) in the 13 selected transactions in which Core LTM EPS or Core LTM net income for the acquired company was
publicly available;

 

 
•  Price per common share to next year estimated EPS of the acquired company in the 12 selected transactions in which

consensus “street estimates” for the acquired company were then available;
 

 
•  Price per common share to book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a

private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by total common
equity);

 

 
•  Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions

involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by
total tangible common equity);

 

 •  Transaction value as a percentage of deposits of the acquired company; and
 

 
•  Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired company,

referred to as core deposit premium.

KBW also reviewed the price per common share paid for the acquired company for the 12 selected transactions in which the
acquired company was publicly traded as a premium/discount to the closing price of the acquired company one day prior to the
announcement of the acquisition and one month prior to the announcement of the acquisition (expressed as a percentage and referred to
as the one-day market premium and one-month market premium). The above transaction statistics for the selected transactions were
compared with the corresponding transaction statistics for the proposed mergers based on the implied transaction value for the
proposed mergers of $659.4 million, or $28.50 per outstanding Pacific Continental common share, and using historical financial
information for Pacific Continental as of or for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, and 2017 EPS consensus “street estimates”
for Pacific Continental.

The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiples for three of the
selected transactions, which multiples were not considered to be meaningful because they were greater than 35.0x):

No company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transactions analysis is identical to Pacific Continental or
the proposed mergers. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and

Relative Contribution Analysis

KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Columbia and Pacific Continental to various pro forma balance sheet and
income statement items of the combined entity. This analysis did not include purchase accounting adjustments or cost savings. To
perform this analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet data for Columbia and Pacific Continental as of September 30, 2016, (ii) year-to-
date income statement data for Columbia and Pacific Continental for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and (iii) estimated
earnings data for Columbia and Pacific Continental taken from consensus “street estimates” for Columbia and Pacific Continental. The
results of KBW’s analysis are set forth in the following table, which also compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the implied pro
forma ownership percentages of Columbia and Pacific Continental shareholders in the combined company based on the 0.6430x
exchange ratio in the proposed first merger:

goodwill impairment.
(3) Q4 2016e, 2017e and 2018e net income to common per consensus street estimates.

Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis

KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected income statement and balance sheet information
of Columbia and Pacific Continental. Using closing balance sheet estimates as of June 30, 2017, for Columbia and Pacific Continental
provided by Columbia management, EPS consensus “street estimates” for Columbia and Pacific Continental, assumed long-term
growth rates for Columbia and Pacific Continental provided by Columbia management and pro forma assumptions (including, without
limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the mergers, and certain accounting adjustments assumed with
respect thereto) provided by Columbia management, KBW analyzed the estimated financial impact of the mergers on certain projected
financial results. This analysis indicated that the mergers could be accretive to Columbia’s second half 2017, 2018 and 2019 estimated
EPS (assuming the impact of one-time, merger-related charges at closing and no additional impact to earnings of one-time, merger-
related charges) and dilutive to Columbia’s estimated tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2017. Furthermore, the analysis
indicated that, pro forma for the mergers, Columbia’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio,
Leverage Ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio could be lower as of June 30, 2017. For all of the

Table of Contents

above analysis, the actual results achieved by Columbia following the mergers may vary from the projected results, and the variations
may be material.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range for the implied equity value of Pacific Continental, taking
into account the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the mergers as well as certain accounting adjustments
assumed with respect thereto. In this analysis, KBW used EPS consensus “street estimates” of Pacific Continental through 2018,
assumed Pacific Continental long term growth rates provided by Columbia management and estimated cost savings and related
expenses and accounting adjustments provided by Columbia management. KBW assumed discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 12.0%.
The ranges of values were derived by adding (i) the present value of the estimated excess cash flows that Pacific Continental could
generate over the 4.5-year period from second half 2017 through 2021, and (ii) the present value of Pacific Continental’s implied
terminal value at the end of such period, in each case applying estimated cost savings and related expenses and accounting adjustments.
In calculating the terminal value of Pacific Continental at the end of 2021, KBW applied a range of 15.0x to 19.0x on estimated 2022
earnings. This discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied values per Pacific Continental common share, taking into
account the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the mergers as well as certain accounting adjustments assumed
with respect thereto, of $27.28 per share to $39.07 per share.

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly
dependent on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates and
discount rates. The analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Pacific Continental.

Miscellaneous

KBW acted as financial advisor to Columbia in connection with the proposed mergers and did not act as an advisor to or agent of
any other person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding
company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has
experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of its and their broker-dealer businesses,
and further to certain existing sales and trading relationships between Columbia and certain KBW affiliates, KBW and its affiliates
may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Columbia and Pacific Continental, and as a market maker in
securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of
Columbia or Pacific Continental for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and clients.

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, Columbia agreed to pay KBW a cash fee of $2.75 million in the aggregate,
$250,000 of which became payable with the rendering of KBW’s opinion and the balance of which is contingent upon the closing of
the mergers. Columbia also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in connection
with its engagement and to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in
connection therewith. In addition to the present engagement, in the past two years, KBW from time to time provided other investment
banking assistance to Columbia, for which KBW did not enter into any engagement agreement or receive compensation. Prior to the
past two years, KBW acted as financial advisor to Columbia in connection with its November 2014 acquisition of Intermountain
Community Bancorp and received compensation for such services. In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW did not
provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Pacific Continental. KBW may in the future provide investment banking
and financial advisory services to Columbia or Pacific Continental and receive compensation for such services.

Opinion of Pacific Continental’s Financial Advisor

On August 17, 2016, Pacific Continental entered into an engagement agreement with Davidson to render financial advisory and
investment banking services to Pacific Continental. As part of its engagement, Davidson agreed to assist Pacific Continental in
analyzing, structuring, negotiating and, if appropriate, effecting a transaction between Pacific Continental and another corporation or
business entity. Davidson also agreed to provide Pacific Continental’s board of directors with an opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Pacific Continental shareholders of the exchange ratio to be paid to the holders of Pacific Continental
common shares in the first merger. Pacific Continental engaged Davidson because Davidson is a nationally recognized investment
banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the mergers and is familiar with Pacific Continental and its business.
As part of its investment banking business, Davidson is continually engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions.

On January 9, 2017, Pacific Continental’s board of directors held a meeting to evaluate the proposed mergers. At this meeting,
Davidson reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed mergers and rendered an opinion to Pacific Continental’s board of directors
that, as such date and based upon and subject to assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken, the exchange ratio to be paid to the holders of Pacific Continental common shares was fair, from a financial point
of view, to the holders of Pacific Continental common shares in the first merger.

The full text of Davidson’s written opinion, dated January 9, 2017, is attached as Appendix E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of such opinion. Pacific Continental shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.

Davidson’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion and Davidson undertakes no obligation to revise or update its
opinion. The opinion is directed to Pacific Continental’s board of directors and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to Pacific Continental shareholders of the exchange ratio to be paid to the holders of Pacific Continental common shares in the
first merger. The opinion does not address, and Davidson expresses no view or opinion with respect to, (i) the underlying business
decision of Pacific Continental to engage in or proceed with the mergers, (ii) the relative merits or effect of the mergers as compared to
any strategic alternatives or business strategies or combinations that may be or may have been available to or contemplated by Pacific
Continental or by Pacific Continental’s board of directors or (iii) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to
Pacific Continental, its shareholders or relating to or arising out of the mergers. The opinion expresses no view or opinion as to any
terms or other aspects of the mergers. Pacific Continental and Columbia determined the exchange ratio through the negotiation process.
The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Pacific Continental shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote at the
Pacific Continental special meeting on the merger proposal or any related matter. The opinion does not express any view as to the
fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Pacific Continental’s or Columbia’s officers, directors or employees, or
any class of such persons, relative to the exchange ratio. The opinion has been reviewed and approved by Davidson’s Fairness Opinion
Committee in conformity with its policies and procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.

Davidson has reviewed the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part and
consented to the inclusion of its opinion to Pacific Continental’s board of directors as Appendix E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and to the references to Davidson and its opinion contained herein. A copy of the consent of Davidson is attached
as Exhibit 99.6 to the registration statement on Form S-4.

and confirmed by, senior management of Columbia and Pacific Continental;

 

 
•  certain publicly available analyst earnings estimates for Pacific Continental for the years ending December 31,

Continental.

In arriving at its opinion, Davidson has assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or
otherwise made available to Davidson, discussed with or reviewed by or for Davidson, or publicly available, and Davidson has not
assumed responsibility for independently verifying such information or undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Pacific Continental or Columbia, nor did Davidson make an independent appraisal or
analysis of Pacific Continental or Columbia with respect to the mergers. In addition, Davidson has not assumed any obligation to
conduct, nor has Davidson conducted any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Pacific Continental or Columbia.
Davidson has further relied on the assurances of management of Pacific Continental and Columbia that they are not aware of any facts
or circumstances that would make any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Davidson did not make an independent evaluation
or appraisal of the specific assets or liabilities including the amount of any fair value adjustments per FASB 141(R). Davidson did not
make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of Pacific Continental or Columbia nor has Davidson
reviewed any individual credit files relating to Pacific Continental or Columbia. Davidson has assumed that the respective allowances
for loan losses for both Pacific Continental and Columbia are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis
for the combined entity. Davidson has assumed that there has been no material change in Pacific Continental’s or Columbia’s assets,
financial condition, results of operations,

agreement and all related agreements are true and correct, that each party to such agreements will perform all of the covenants required

Davidson has assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise)
for the mergers, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendment or modifications, will be imposed that will have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the mergers. Davidson’s opinion is necessarily based upon information

opinion letter was delivered to Pacific Continental’s board of directors.

Summary of Proposal

Davidson reviewed the financial terms of the proposed transaction. As described in the merger agreement, each outstanding
Pacific Continental common share will be converted into 0.6430 of a Columbia common share at closing, subject to certain
adjustments. The terms and conditions of the mergers are more fully described in the merger agreement. For purposes of the financial
analyses described below, based on the closing price of Columbia common shares on January 6, 2017, of $44.33, the exchange ratio
represented a value of $28.50 per Pacific Continental common share. Based upon financial information as of or for the twelve month
period ended September 30, 2016, Davidson calculated the following transaction ratios:

Precedent Transactions Analysis

Davidson reviewed three sets of comparable merger and acquisition transactions. The sets of mergers and acquisitions included:
(1) “Western U.S. Transactions,” (2) “Nationwide Transactions,” and (3) “Nationwide Stock Transactions.”

“Western U.S. Transactions,” included 10 transactions where:
 

 •  the transaction involved banks and bank holding companies headquartered in the Western U.S.;
 

 •  the transaction was announced between January 1, 2013 and January 6, 2017;
 

 •  the selling company’s total assets were between $1.0 billion and $10.0 billion; and
 

 •  the transaction was not a merger of equals.

“Nationwide Transactions” included 18 transactions where:
 

 •  the transaction involved banks and bank holding companies headquartered nationwide;
 

 •  the transaction was announced between January 1, 2016 and January 6, 2017;
 

 •  the selling company’s total assets were between $1.0 billion and $10.0 billion; and
 

 •  the transaction was not a merger of equals.

Net Present Value Analysis for Pacific Continental

Davidson performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per Pacific Continental common share under various
circumstances. The analysis assumed: (i) Pacific Continental performed in accordance with average FactSet consensus earnings
estimates for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018; and (ii) an estimated long-term growth
rate for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by Pacific Continental management. To approximate the terminal value of
Pacific Continental common shares at December 31, 2020, Davidson applied price to forward earnings multiples of 14.0x to 26.0x and
multiples of tangible book value ranging from 160.0% to 300.0%. The income streams and terminal values were then discounted to
present values using different discount rates ranging from 9.00% to 15.00% chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required
rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of Pacific Continental common shares. In evaluating the discount rate, Davidson used
industry standard methods of adding the current risk-free rate, which is based on the 20-year Treasury yield, plus the published Duff &
Phelps Industry Equity Risk Premium and plus the published Duff & Phelps Size Premium.

At the January 9, 2017 Pacific Continental board of directors meeting, Davidson noted that the net present value analysis is a
widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent

upon the numerous assumptions that must be made, and the results thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results.

As illustrated in the following tables, the analysis indicates an imputed range of values per Pacific Continental common share of
$17.05 to $37.36 when applying the price to forward earnings multiples to the financial forecasts described above and $15.19 to $33.38

Davidson also considered and discussed with Pacific Continental’s board of directors how this analysis would be affected by
changes in the underlying assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Davidson performed a
similar analysis assuming Pacific Continental’s estimated EPS in 2021 varied from 20.00% above projections to 20.00% below
projections. This analysis resulted in the following range of values per Pacific Continental common share, using the same price to
forward earnings multiples of 14.0x to 26.0x and using a discount rate of 10.00%.

Net Present Value Analysis for Pro Forma Pacific Continental

Davidson performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per Pacific Continental common share under various
circumstances, including the impact of the mergers with Columbia. The analysis assumed (i) Pacific Continental performed in
accordance with average FactSet consensus earnings estimates for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2018; (ii) an estimated long-term growth rate for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by Pacific
Continental management; and (iii) the pro forma financial impact of the mergers with Columbia including the cost savings estimates,
purchase accounting adjustments and transaction expenses, as discussed with and confirmed by Pacific Continental management. The
analysis assumed (i) Columbia performed in accordance with average FactSet consensus earnings estimates for the years ending
December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018; and (ii) an estimated long-term growth rate for the years thereafter,
as discussed with and confirmed by Pacific Continental management. To approximate the terminal value of Pacific Continental
common shares at December 31, 2020, Davidson applied price to forward earnings multiples of 14.0x to 26.0x and multiples of

similar analysis assuming Pacific Continental’s pro forma estimated EPS in 2021 varied from 20.00% above projections to 20.00%
below projections. This analysis resulted in the following range of values per Pacific Continental common share, using the same price
to forward earnings multiples of 14.0x to 26.0x and using a discount rate of 10.00%.

Net Present Value Analysis for Columbia

Davidson performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per Columbia common share under various circumstances.
The analysis assumed: (i) Columbia performed in accordance with average FactSet consensus earnings estimates for the years ending
December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018; and (ii) an estimated long-term growth rate for the years thereafter,
as discussed with and confirmed by Pacific Continental management. To approximate the terminal value of Columbia common shares
at December 31, 2020, Davidson applied price to forward earnings multiples of 14.0x to 26.0x and multiples of tangible book value
ranging from 180.0% to 320.0%. The income streams and terminal values were then discounted to present values using different
discount rates ranging from 9.00% to 15.00% chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or
prospective buyers of Columbia common shares. In evaluating the discount rate, Davidson used industry standard methods of adding
the current risk-free rate, which is based on the 20-year Treasury yield, plus the published Duff & Phelps Industry Equity Risk
Premium and plus the published Duff & Phelps Size Premium.

At the January 9, 2017 Pacific Continental board of directors meeting, Davidson noted that the net present value analysis is a
widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous assumptions that
must be made, and the results thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results.

As illustrated in the following tables, the analysis indicates an imputed range of values per Columbia common share of $25.86 to
$56.03 when applying the price to forward earnings multiples to the financial forecasts described above and $25.87 to $53.80 when
applying the multiples of tangible book value to the financial forecasts described above.

Financial Impact Analysis

Davidson performed pro forma merger analyses that combined projected income statement and balance sheet information of
Pacific Continental and Columbia. Assumptions regarding the accounting treatment, acquisition adjustments and cost savings were
used to calculate the financial impact that the mergers would have on certain projected financial results of Columbia. In the course of
this analysis, Davidson used average FactSet consensus earnings estimates for Pacific Continental for the years ending December 31,
2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and used average FactSet consensus earnings estimates for Columbia for the years
ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. This analysis indicated that the mergers

Table of Contents

are expected to be accretive to Columbia’s estimated EPS beginning in 2017, after excluding non-recurring transaction-related
expenses. The analysis also indicated that the mergers are expected to be dilutive to tangible book value per Columbia common share
and that Columbia would maintain capital ratios in excess of those required for Columbia to be considered well-capitalized under
existing regulations. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by Pacific Continental and Columbia prior to and
following the mergers will vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Davidson prepared its analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to Pacific Continental’s board of directors as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to Pacific Continental shareholders of the exchange ratio to be paid to the holders of Pacific Continental
common shares in the first merger and to assist Pacific Continental’s board of directors in analyzing the proposed mergers. The
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their respective advisors, none of Pacific Continental, Columbia,
Davidson or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted.

Davidson’s opinion was one of many factors considered by Pacific Continental’s board of directors in its evaluation of the
mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the board of directors of Pacific Continental or management with
respect to the mergers or the merger consideration.

Davidson and its affiliates, as part of their investment banking business, are continually engaged in performing financial analyses
with respect to businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and other transactions. Davidson acted as
financial advisor to Pacific Continental in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the mergers.
Davidson is a full service securities firm engaged, either directly or through its affiliates, in securities trading, investment management,
financial planning and benefits counseling, financing and brokerage activities for both companies and individuals. In the ordinary
course of these activities, Davidson and its affiliates may provide such services to Pacific Continental, Columbia and their respective
affiliates, may actively trade the debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) of Pacific Continental and Columbia for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions of such securities. Pacific
Continental selected Davidson as its financial advisor because it is a recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the mergers. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated August 17, 2016, Pacific Continental engaged
Davidson as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter,
Pacific Continental agreed to pay Davidson a cash fee of $500,000 concurrently with the rendering of its opinion. Pacific Continental
will pay to Davidson at the time of closing of the mergers a contingent cash fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate consideration less
$250,000 to credit half of the fairness opinion fee; however, the total fees payable to Davidson shall not cause Pacific Continental’s
transaction expenses to exceed the limit as defined in the merger agreement. Pacific Continental has also agreed to reimburse Davidson
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of counsel, and to indemnify Davidson and certain related persons against
specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, relating to or arising out of its engagement.

Davidson has, in the past, provided certain investment banking services to Pacific Continental and its affiliates, has had a material
relationship with Pacific Continental and its affiliates and has received compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses for
such services. During the two years preceding the date of the opinion, Davidson received compensation for acting as Pacific
Continental’s financial advisor in connection with the acquisition of Foundation Bancorp in 2016, as well as the acquisition of Capital
Pacific Bancorp in 2015. Additionally, Davidson may provide investment banking services to the combined company in the future and
may receive future compensation.

Columbia Management and Board of Directors After the Mergers

Upon completion of the first merger, the Columbia board of directors will consist of the directors serving on the Columbia board
of directors prior to the effective time of the first merger plus one community-based director from the Pacific Continental board of
directors, to be selected by Columbia’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (which Pacific Continental director will also
be invited to join the Columbia Bank board of directors).

The remaining current directors and senior officers of Columbia are expected to continue in their current positions, other than as
has been or may be publicly announced by Columbia in the normal course of business. Information about the current Columbia
directors and executive officers can be found in the documents listed under “Where You Can Find More Information” included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Interests of Columbia Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers

In considering the recommendations of the Columbia board of directors, Columbia shareholders should be aware that certain
directors and executive officers of Columbia have interests in the mergers that may differ from, or may be in addition to, the interests
of Columbia shareholders generally. These interests are described in more detail and quantified below. The Columbia board of directors
was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, when it adopted and approved the merger agreement and in
making its recommendations that the Columbia shareholders approve the Columbia share issuance proposal.

Continuing Services as Directors on the Columbia Board

The Columbia board of directors after the mergers will include each of the current directors from the current Columbia board of
directors, in addition to one director from the current Pacific Continental board of directors. The Columbia board of directors presently
consists of eleven directors.

Continuing Employment with the Columbia Surviving Corporation

It is currently expected that the executive officers of Columbia will continue their employment with Columbia following the
effective time of the first merger on substantially similar terms and conditions in existence immediately prior to the effective time of
the first merger.

None of Columbia’s directors or executive officers is a party to, or participates in any, Columbia plan, program or arrangement
that provides such director or executive officer with any kind of compensation that is based on or otherwise related to the completion of
the mergers.

Director’s and Officers’ Insurance

Columbia will continue to provide indemnification and insurance coverage to the directors and executive officers of Columbia.

Interests of Pacific Continental’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers

In considering the recommendations of the board of directors of Pacific Continental, Pacific Continental shareholders should be
aware that certain directors and executive officers of Pacific Continental have interests in the mergers that may differ from, or may be
in addition to, the interests of Pacific Continental shareholders generally. These interests are described in more detail and quantified
below. The board of directors of Pacific Continental was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, when it
adopted the merger agreement and in making its recommendations that the Pacific Continental shareholders approve the merger
proposal. For purposes of all Pacific Continental agreements and plans described below, the completion of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will constitute a change of control or a term of similar meaning.

Table of Contents

Board Membership

Under the merger agreement, Columbia’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to Columbia’s
board of directors one person from Pacific Continental’s board of directors to serve on Columbia’s board of directors and the board of
directors of Columbia Bank effective upon the closing of the first merger.

Indemnification and Insurance

Under the merger agreement, Columbia will provide or purchase director and officer liability insurance for a period of six years
following the effective time of the first merger to reimburse each present and former director and officer of Pacific Continental or its
subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring before the effective time of the first merger, which insurance
will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to such persons as that
coverage currently provided by Pacific Continental to the present and former directors and officers of Pacific Continental or its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the completion of the first merger, provided that Columbia is not required to expend in the aggregate
for such six-year period, an amount in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premiums paid as of the date of the merger agreement
by Pacific Continental for any such insurance. If any such annual expense at any time would exceed that amount, then Columbia will
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to that
amount. Prior to the effective time of the first merger, and in lieu of the foregoing, Pacific Continental will use reasonable best efforts
to purchase a six-year prepaid tail policy for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance on the terms described above and subject to
certain other specifications agreed to by the parties and fully pay for such policy prior to the effective time of the first merger, at an
aggregate cost up to, but not exceeding 200% of the current annual premiums for such insurance.

Treatment of Pacific Continental Equity Awards

Pacific Continental RSUs. Pacific Continental has awarded Pacific Continental RSUs to certain employees. At the effective time
of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental RSU, whether vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holder of such Pacific Continental RSU to receive (without
interest), no later than the first payroll period following the effective time of the first merger and in any event no later than 30 calendar
days following the closing date, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of shares subject to such Pacific Continental RSUs
multiplied by (y) the equity award cashout price, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. As of
April 20, 2017, the number of unvested Pacific Continental RSUs held by the executive officers, is as follows: Mr. Beard: 8,829 Pacific
Continental RSUs; Mr. Busse: 34,381 Pacific Continental RSUs; Ms. Ghazal: 8,249 Pacific Continental RSUs; Mr. Hagstrom: 15,910
Pacific Continental RSUs; Mr. Harding: 8,915 Pacific Continental RSUs; Mr. Hogan: 14,693 Pacific Continental RSUs;
Mr. McGillivray: 2,783 Pacific Continental RSUs; Mr. Rose: 5,261 Pacific Continental RSUs; Mr. Sawyer: 2,517 Pacific Continental
RSUs; Mr. Stevenson: 3,433 Pacific Continental RSUs; and Ms. Ulrich: 7,590 Pacific Continental RSUs.

Pacific Continental Options. Pacific Continental has awarded Pacific Continental options to certain employees. At the effective
time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental option, whether vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holder of such Pacific Continental option to receive
(without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the effective time of the first merger and in any event no later than
30 calendar days following the closing date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares subject to such Pacific
Continental options multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the equity award cashout price over (B) the exercise price per share of
such Pacific Continental options less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Any Pacific Continental
options which have an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the equity award cashout price will be cancelled at the
effective time of the first merger for no consideration or payment. As of April 20, 2017, no executive officers held any unvested
options.

Pacific Continental SARs. Pacific Continental has awarded Pacific Continental SARs to certain of its employees. At the effective
time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental SAR, whether cash-settled or stock-settled, whether vested or unvested,
will, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and will only entitle the holder of such Pacific
Continental SAR to receive (without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the effective time of the first merger and
in any event no later than 30 calendar days following the closing date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares subject to such Pacific Continental SARs multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the equity award cashout price over (B) the
reference price per share of such Pacific Continental SARs less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
Any Pacific Continental SAR which has a reference price per share that is greater than or equal to the equity award cashout price will
be cancelled at the effective time of the first merger for no consideration or payment. As of April 20, 2017, no executive officers held
any unvested Pacific Continental SARs.

Pacific Continental Restricted Stock Awards. Pacific Continental has awarded Pacific Continental restricted stock to directors that
are subject to vesting conditions. At the effective time of the first merger, each outstanding Pacific Continental restricted stock award
will, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and will be converted into, and become
exchanged for the merger consideration. As of April 20, 2017, no non-employee directors hold any unvested Pacific Continental
restricted stock awards.

Voting and Non-Competition Agreements of Pacific Continental Executive Officers and Directors

In addition to any other restrictive covenant described below, in connection with the mergers, each member of the Pacific
Continental board of directors was asked to, and did, enter into a voting and non-competition agreement pursuant to which he or she
agreed, among other things, to vote his or her shares in favor of approval of (i) the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, (ii) any other matter that is required to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (iii) any proposal
to adjourn or postpone the Pacific Continental special meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger
agreement. Such directors have also agreed to vote against any action or agreement submitted for approval to the shareholders of
Pacific Continental that would (i) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
Pacific Continental under the merger agreement, (ii) result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the first merger under the
merger agreement not being fulfilled, (iii) be in competition with or opposition to the merger agreement or the first merger, (iv) be an
acquisition proposal or (v) impair the ability of Columbia to complete the first merger, the ability of Pacific Continental to complete the
first merger, or that would otherwise be inconsistent with, prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

The directors have also agreed, for a two-year period following the closing of the first merger, not to directly or indirectly become
involved in any competing business, which is defined as any depository, wealth management or trust business company or holding
company thereof within the States of Oregon and Washington, subject to certain exceptions, and for a two-year period following the
closing of the first merger, not to solicit any employees or customers of Columbia and its subsidiaries. See “The Merger Agreement—
Related Agreements” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Employment Agreements of Mr. Busse and Mr. Hogan with Pacific Continental

Pacific Continental Bank and Pacific Continental previously entered into employment agreements with Mr. Busse and Mr. Hogan.
The employment agreements provide for change in control payments in the event that:
 

 
•  a change in control is consummated while the executive is employed by Pacific Continental and the executive is not offered

a “comparable position” with the acquiring or surviving company; or
 

 
•  the executive’s employment is terminated by the acquiring or surviving company other than for “cause” or by the executive

for “good reason” within one year after accepting a “comparable position” with the acquiring or surviving company in a
change in control (each a, “qualifying termination”).

Table of Contents

Upon a change in control where the executive is not offered a “comparable position” or a qualifying termination, the change in
control payments and benefits under these employment agreements generally include:
 

 
•  a lump sum payment equal to two and a half (Mr. Busse) or two (Mr. Hogan) times the sum of the executive’s base salary

and cash incentive bonus opportunity (together, the “potential annual compensation”);
 

 •  the immediate vesting of all unvested equity awards upon termination of employment; and
 

 
•  payment of premiums for COBRA group health coverage as in effect at the time of termination of employment for the lesser

of 12 months and the maximum time permitted by applicable law.

“Comparable position” is defined in Mr. Busse’s agreement as the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of the
acquiring or surviving company, on financial terms in the aggregate no less favorable than under Mr. Busse’s existing employment
agreement. “Comparable position” is defined in Mr. Hogan’s agreement as the position of Chief Operating Officer of the acquiring or
surviving company, on financial terms in the aggregate no less favorable than under Mr. Hogan’s existing employment agreement.

“Cause” is defined in each of Messrs. Busse and Hogan’s agreements generally as one or more of the following: (i) willful
misfeasance or gross negligence in the performance of the executive’s duties; (ii) conviction of a crime in connection with executive’s
duties; or (iii) conduct demonstrably and significantly harmful to Pacific Continental or Pacific Continental Bank, as reasonably
determined on the advice of legal counsel by the Pacific Continental board of directors.

“Good reason” is defined in each of Messrs. Busse and Hogan’s agreements generally as any of (i) a reduction of executive’s
salary or reduction or elimination of any significant compensation or benefit plan, unless the reduction or elimination is generally
applicable to all similarly-situated employees or to substantially all employees; (ii) the assignment to executive, without express
written consent, of any authority or duties materially and substantially inconsistent with executive’s position; or (iii) a relocation or
transfer, without consent, of executive’s principal place of employment that would require executive to commute more than 50 miles
each way from Pacific Continental Bank’s headquarters in Eugene, Oregon.

The employment agreements with Messrs. Busse and Hogan also include a two-year employee and customer non-solicit condition
following termination of employment.

Transition Agreement of Mr. Hogan with Columbia

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Mr. Hogan entered into a transition agreement with Columbia. The
transition agreement will be effective immediately following the effective time of the first merger and provides that Mr. Hogan will
serve initially as “integration leader” during a period of employment that will end the later of (i) September 15, 2017, and (ii) the date
Pacific Continental and Columbia complete the conversion of their systems onto a combined system. During the period of
employment, Mr. Hogan will have an initial annual base salary of $292,275 and be entitled to receive benefits similar to those offered
by Columbia to similarly situated employees of Columbia. After Mr. Hogan’s employment terminates he will then serve as a consultant
to Columbia during an 18-month consulting period.

The transition agreement prohibits Mr. Hogan from directly or indirectly becoming involved in any competing business, which is
defined as any depository, wealth management or trust business company or holding company thereof (including without limitation,
any start-up bank or bank in formation) within the States of Idaho, Washington and Oregon during the employment period or the post-
employment consulting period. Mr. Hogan is also prohibited from soliciting any employee, independent contractor, customer, business
partner or joint venture of Columbia for a period of two years after the later of the effective time of the first merger or the employment
period ends.

During the consulting period and subject to complying with the non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions, Mr. Hogan will
receive $200,000 payable by Columbia in two equal installments, within 30 days following: (i) the date nine months after the
consulting period begins and (ii) the date on which the consulting period ends. Mr. Hogan will also receive payment of premiums for
COBRA group health coverage, as in effect at the time of his termination of employment, for the lesser of the 18-month consulting
period and the maximum time permitted by applicable law.

Change in Control Agreements with other Executive Officers

Certain executive officers (other than Mr. Busse and Mr. Hogan, who have employment agreements as described above) have
previously entered into change in control agreements with Pacific Continental Bank and Pacific Continental that provide for benefits
on a termination of employment by Pacific Continental other than for “cause” or by the executive for “good reason” within 24 months
after a change in control.

Upon such a termination, the severance payments and benefits under these agreements generally include:
 

 

•  A lump sum salary continuation payment, equal to the higher of the executive officer’s “compensation” (meaning annualized
base salary plus annual cash incentive opportunity), (i) immediately prior to the change in control, or (ii) the highest level of
“compensation” in effect after the change in control, for the balance of the salary continuation period. The salary
continuation period begins on the effective date of the change in control and continues thereafter for 24 months; and

 

 •  The immediate vesting of all unvested equity awards upon termination of employment.

“Cause” is defined in the change in control agreements generally as any one or more of the following: (i) removal or discharge
pursuant to order of any federal banking authority; (ii) fraud, dishonesty, or other act of misconduct in the rendering of services to
Pacific Continental or Pacific Continental Bank or to customers, or if executive engages in conduct which, in the opinion of the Pacific
Continental board of directors, materially interferes with the performance of executive’s duties or harms the reputation of Pacific
Continental or Pacific Continental Bank; (iii) executive conceals from, or knowingly fails to disclose to, any federal banking regulatory
authority or the board of directors of Pacific Continental or Pacific Continental Bank any material matters affecting the safety and
soundness or regulatory condition of Pacific Continental or Pacific Continental Bank; or (iv) executive fails (or refuses) to successfully
or diligently perform any of the usual and customary duties of his/her employment and either fails to remedy the lapse or formulate a
plan for its correction with Pacific Continental or Pacific Continental Bank (if such failure is not susceptible to immediate correction)
within 30 days after notice.

“Good reason” is defined in the change in control agreements generally as (i) a reduction of executive’s salary or a reduction in
benefits under or elimination of any significant compensation or benefit plan, unless the reduction or elimination is generally
applicable to substantially all similarly situated employees; (ii) the assignment to executive, without consent, of any authority or duties
materially inconsistent with executive’s position; or (iii) a relocation or transfer of executive’s principal place of employment that
would require executive to commute on a regular basis more than 50 miles each way from executive’s present place of employment.

The change in control agreements also include a two-year employee and customer non-solicit condition following termination of
employment.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, employees who are party to employment agreements or change in control agreements,
including Messrs. Busse and Hogan, are required to waive the application of any merit-based increase in base salary, as in effect on
January 9, 2017, to the calculation of any change in control payment (including in respect of any corresponding increase in annual
incentive opportunity due to the base salary increase).

For an estimate of the amounts that may be paid or become payable in connection with a qualifying termination of employment
following the first merger to Pacific Continental’s named executive officers who are party to the employment agreements or change in
control agreements described above, see “—Merger-Related Compensation for Pacific Continental’s Named Executive Officers”

Transition Agreements with other Executive Officers

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Columbia has entered into transition agreements with certain of Pacific
Continental’s executive officers (other than Pacific Continental’s named executive officers).

The transition agreements are for a term of two years beginning at the effective time of the first merger unless extended by
agreement of the parties. During the term, the executives will have an initial annual base salary consistent with their base salary at the
effective time of the first merger and be entitled to receive benefits similar to those offered by Columbia to similarly situated
employees of Columbia. Certain of the executive officers may be given the opportunity to enter into change in control agreements with
Columbia on terms and conditions of agreements provided to similarly situated executives of Columbia, subject to the approval of the
Columbia board of directors.

Under the transition agreements, the executives will be eligible to receive a cash retention payment based on the lump sum
severance payment that the executive officers would be entitled to under their existing change in control agreements with Pacific
Continental Bank and Pacific Continental on their termination of employment by Pacific Continental other than for “cause” or by the
executive for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the existing change in control agreements with Pacific Continental Bank and
Pacific Continental) within 24 months after a change in control, as described under “—Change in Control Agreements with other
Executive Officers” above (the “Retention Bonus”), and the executives will not be entitled to receive payments under such existing
change in control agreements. The terms of the Retention Bonus vary by executive, but in each case will vest and be payable no later
than the second anniversary of the effective time of the first merger, subject to the executive’s continued employment through the
applicable vesting date. If Columbia terminates the executive’s employment without “cause” or if the executive terminates his or her
employment for “good reason” (as such terms are defined below), or if the executive’s employment is terminated by reason of death or
disability, then any unvested portions of the Retention Bonus may vest on such termination of employment, with terms varying by
executive.

Certain of the executive officers are also entitled to an additional retention bonus of up to $100,000 under their transition
agreements with Columbia. Such additional retention bonuses vary by executive, but in each case vest no later than the second
anniversary of the effective time of the first merger, subject to the executive’s continued employment through the applicable vesting
date. If Columbia terminates the executive’s employment without “cause” or if the executive terminates his or her employment for
“good reason” (as such terms are defined below) than any unvested portions of the additional retention bonus may vest on such
termination of employment, with terms varying by executive.

“Cause” is defined in the transition agreements generally as the executive engaging in any of the following: (i) embezzlement,
dishonesty or other fraudulent acts involving Columbia or Columbia’s business operations; (ii) willful material breach of the transition
agreement or a confidentiality policy of Columbia; (iii) conviction (where entered upon a verdict or a plea, including a plea of no
contest) on any felony charge or on a misdemeanor directly reflecting upon the executive’s honesty; or (iv) an act or omission that
materially injures Columbia’s reputation, business affairs or financial condition, if that injury could have been reasonably avoided by
the executive.

“Good Reason” is defined in the transition agreements generally as: (i) any material reduction in base salary or reduction or
elimination of any compensation or benefit plan benefiting the executive, which reduction or elimination does not generally apply to
substantially all similarly situated executives; (ii) a relocation or transfer of the executive’s place of employment to an office or
location that is more than a specified distance from the executive’s primary place of employment; or (iii) material diminution in the
executive’s responsibilities, authority or duties from the executive’s responsibilities, authority and duties.

The transition agreements also prohibit the executive from directly or indirectly becoming involved in any competing business,
which is defined as any depository, wealth management or trust business company or holding company thereof (including without
limitation, any start-up bank or bank in formation) within the States of Idaho, Washington and Oregon for a period of one year after the
later of (i) the effective time of the first merger and (ii) the

date of the executive’s termination of employment. The executive is also prohibited from soliciting any employee, independent
contractor, customer, business partner or joint venture of Columbia for a period of two years after the later of (i) the effective time of
the merger or (ii) the date of the executive’s termination of employment.

Merger-Related Compensation for Pacific Continental’s Named Executive Officers

The following table and the related footnotes provide information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K about the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Pacific Continental’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the mergers. The compensation shown in this table and described in these footnotes is the subject of a non-binding advisory
vote of the Pacific Continental shareholders at the Pacific Continental special meeting, as described in “Pacific Continental Proposals
—Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal.” The figures in the table are estimated based on compensation
levels as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and an assumed effective date of April 20, 2017, for both the mergers and,
where applicable, termination of the named executive officer’s employment. The amounts reported below are estimates based on
multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including assumptions described in this
document, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the completion of the mergers. All amounts below
that are determined using the value per Pacific Continental common share have been calculated based on a price per Pacific
Continental common share of $26.08 (the average closing market price of Pacific Continental common shares over the first five
business days following the public announcement of the mergers on January 9, 2017, as reported by Nasdaq). As a result of the
foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts
set forth below.

comparable position (single trigger) or following which a qualifying termination occurs (double trigger) (as described above)
Mr. Busse’s actual lump sum cash change in control payment would equal two and a half times his “potential annual
compensation,” and Mr. Hogan’s lump sum cash change in control payment would equal two times his “potential annual
compensation.” Pursuant to the change in control agreements with Ms. Ulrich, Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Hagstrom, their actual double
trigger cash severance payments in the case of a termination event related to a change in control would be a lump sum equal to the
executive’s post change in control salary for the balance of the salary continuation period (as described above).

(2) Represents “single-trigger” Pacific Continental RSUs that will fully vest and be cashed out upon the first merger as set forth in the
merger agreement and described under “The Mergers—Treatment of Pacific Continental Equity Awards” above, based on a
$26.08 price per share multiplied by 34,381 Pacific Continental RSUs outstanding in the case of Mr. Busse, 14,693 Pacific
Continental RSUs outstanding for Mr. Hogan, 2,517 Pacific Continental RSUs outstanding for Mr. Sawyer, 15,910 Pacific
Continental RSUs outstanding for Mr. Hagstrom and 7,590 Pacific Continental RSUs outstanding for Ms. Ulrich.

(3) Represents the estimated value of continued medical and dental insurance benefits payable under Mr. Busse’s and Mr. Hogan’s
employment agreements for up to 12 months after a qualifying termination.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Effects of the Mergers

As a result of the first merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Pacific Continental with Pacific Continental continuing as the
surviving corporation in the first merger. Immediately following the first merger, Pacific Continental will merge with and into
Columbia, with Columbia as the surviving entity in the subsequent merger. Immediately following the subsequent merger, Pacific
Continental Bank will merge with and into Columbia Bank, with Columbia Bank as the surviving entity in the bank merger.

As a result of the mergers, there will no longer be any publicly held common shares of Pacific Continental. In receiving Columbia
common shares as merger consideration, former Pacific Continental shareholders will only participate in Columbia’s future earnings
and potential growth through their ownership of Columbia common shares. All of the other incidents of direct stock ownership in
Pacific Continental, such as the right to vote on certain corporate decisions, to elect directors and to receive dividends and distributions
from Pacific Continental, will be extinguished upon completion of the first merger.

Effective Time of the First Merger

The closing of the first merger will occur at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on the first business day of the first calendar month that
follows the month in which the last to be satisfied of the closing conditions is satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied or waived at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), unless the parties mutually
agree to extend the closing. The first merger will be completed legally at the date and time specified in the articles of merger to be filed
by Columbia with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon. As of the date of this document, the parties expect that the first merger
will be effective mid-2017. However, there can be no assurance as to when or if the first merger will occur.

As described below, if the first merger has not closed by November 9, 2017, which date may be extended to January 9, 2018,
under certain conditions, the merger agreement may be terminated by either Pacific Continental or Columbia, unless the failure of the
closing to occur by such date is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in the merger agreement.

Covenants and Agreements

Conduct of Businesses Prior to the Completion of the First Merger

Pacific Continental has agreed that, except as previously disclosed, as expressly contemplated by or permitted by the merger
agreement, as required by applicable law or with the prior written consent of Columbia, prior to the date and time when the first merger
becomes effective, Pacific Continental will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, conduct its business, and cause its subsidiaries to
conduct their respective businesses, in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization and advantageous business relationships, and goodwill with
governmental entities, customers, suppliers, distributors, creditors, lessors, officers and employees and business associates and keep
available the services of Pacific Continental and its subsidiaries’ present employees and agents. Pacific Continental and Columbia have
agreed to take no action (and to cause their subsidiaries to take no action) that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect or materially delay the ability of either Pacific Continental or Columbia to obtain any necessary approvals of any
regulatory agency or other governmental entity required for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform the
covenants and agreements in the merger agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

encumbrances, licenses, lapses, cancellations, abandonments or other dispositions or discontinuances in the ordinary course
of business and in a transaction that, together with other such transactions, is not material to Pacific Continental and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

governed as described below) except in the ordinary course of business and in a transaction that, together with other such

statement on Form S-4, in which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is included. Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental has
agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and Pacific Continental and Columbia agreed to then mail or deliver the joint proxy statement/prospectus
to their respective shareholders. Columbia also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
“blue sky” permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and Pacific Continental
agreed to furnish all information concerning Pacific Continental and the holders of Pacific Continental common shares as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

Columbia and Pacific Continental have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
such third parties or governmental entities. Columbia agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to make all initial requisite
regulatory filings on or before February 23, 2017, and in any event as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (other than any notice
to the Federal Reserve under its regulations, which will be filed in accordance with the timing contemplated by such regulations).
Pacific Continental and Columbia have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws, all the non-confidential information relating to Pacific Continental or Columbia (excluding any
confidential financial information relating to individuals), as the case may be, and any of their respective subsidiaries, that appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any governmental entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. In exercising this right, each of the parties has agreed to act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Pacific Continental and Columbia will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities necessary or advisable to consummate the mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and each party will keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to such approvals and the completion of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each
party will consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any governmental entity in connection with the mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental has agreed to furnish to the other, upon request, all information concerning itself, its
subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Columbia, Pacific Continental or any of their respective subsidiaries to any governmental entity in connection with the mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental has agreed to cooperate with the other and use its reasonable best efforts in good faith
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable on its part
under the merger agreement or under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated as promptly as practicable, including the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement.

Neither Columbia nor any of its subsidiaries are required to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining any permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any governmental entities
that would reasonably be likely, in each case following the effective time of the first merger (but regardless when the action, condition
or restriction is taken or implemented), to have a material adverse effect on Columbia (measured on a scale relative to Pacific
Continental), a material adverse effect on Pacific Continental or materially restrict or impose a material burden on Columbia or any of
its subsidiaries (including, after the effective time of the first merger, Pacific Continental and its subsidiaries) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or with respect to the business or operation of Columbia or any of its subsidiaries
(including, after the effective time of the first merger, Pacific Continental and its subsidiaries), which we refer to as a materially
burdensome regulatory condition.

Each of Columbia and Pacific Continental will promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any
governmental entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite
regulatory approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

Shareholder Approval

Each party has agreed to convene a special meeting of its shareholders as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective to consider and vote upon the proposals necessary to consummate the mergers, and each party has agreed to recommend to its
shareholders that they approve such proposals. Pacific Continental may change its recommendation to its shareholders if, following
receipt of a superior proposal (as defined below), the Pacific Continental board of directors concludes in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

Nasdaq Listing

Columbia has agreed to file with Nasdaq any required notices or forms with respect to the Columbia common shares to be issued
in the first merger.

Employee Matters

The merger agreement provides that for the period beginning on the effective time of the first merger and ending on the 18-month
anniversary of the effective time of the first merger, Columbia will provide each employee who is actively employed by Pacific
Continental and its subsidiaries on the closing date, while employed by Columbia or any of its subsidiaries following the effective time
of the first merger, whom we refer to as a continuing employee, with: (i) base salary no less favorable than the base salary provided to
such continuing employees immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger; (ii) annual cash bonus opportunities no less
favorable than annual cash bonus opportunities provided by Columbia to similarly situated employees of Columbia; and (iii) employee
benefits which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than employee benefits provided by Columbia to similarly situated employees of
Columbia, provided that until Columbia causes such continuing employees to participate in Columbia employee benefit plans, a
continuing employee’s continued participation in a Pacific Continental employee benefit plan satisfies this provision.

Table of Contents

From and after the effective time of the first merger, Columbia will honor and make the payments provided for, as required by the
terms of, all written employment agreements and change in control agreements with employees of Pacific Continental or any of its
subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the closing date, subject to any limitations imposed under applicable law or by any
regulatory authority. During the period commencing at the effective time of the first merger and ending on the 18-month anniversary of
the effective time of the first merger, Columbia will provide each continuing employee who is not party to an individual employment,
severance or change of control agreement at the time of his or her termination of employment whose employment is involuntarily
terminated (other than under circumstances that constitute a termination for “cause”) with certain agreed upon severance payments
and/or benefits.

Upon continuing employees’ enrollment in Columbia’s employee benefit plans, such continuing employees will, consistent with
the merger agreement, become participants in all of Columbia’s employee benefit plans, practices, and policies on the same terms and
conditions as similarly situated employees of Columbia. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior service credit for each
continuing employee’s service with Pacific Continental, except as expressly provided otherwise in the merger agreement, will be given
by Columbia with respect to all Columbia retirement plans, employee benefit plans, practices and policies to the extent that such
crediting of service does not result in duplication of benefits, but not for accrual of benefits under any defined benefit. If any continuing
employee becomes eligible to participate in any Columbia employee benefit plan, practice or policy that provides medical,
hospitalization or dental benefits, Columbia will use commercially reasonably best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Columbia employee benefit plan to be waived with respect to such continuing
employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the employee
benefit plan in which such continuing employee participated immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger, and
(B) recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable to continuing employees,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents under any Pacific
Continental employee benefit plan on or prior to the closing date.

If requested in writing by Columbia at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective time of the first merger, Pacific Continental
will take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by Columbia to be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective not
later than the business day immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger, any Pacific Continental employee benefit plan
that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. In the event that Columbia requests
that such plan(s) be terminated, Pacific Continental will provide Columbia with evidence that such plan(s) has been terminated (the
form and substance of which will be subject to review and approval by Columbia, approval of which will not be unreasonably
withheld) not later than the business day immediately preceding the effective time of the first merger. Effective as of the effective time
of the first merger, Columbia will have in effect a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, which
plan will accept the transfer of account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) of each participant in
the Pacific Continental savings plan as of the closing date.

From and after the date of the merger agreement, prior to making any written or oral communications to officers or employees of
Pacific Continental or any of its subsidiaries pertaining to compensation, benefit or other employment-related matters that are affected
by the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Pacific Continental will provide Columbia with a copy of the intended
communication or talking points, Columbia will have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and
Columbia and Pacific Continental will cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

From and after the effective time of the first merger, Columbia and the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of Pacific Continental and its subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable, documented attorneys’

fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the first merger, including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to the extent they are indemnified
by Pacific Continental or its subsidiaries on the date of the merger agreement, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
Columbia and the surviving corporation have also agreed to advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, which will be repaid if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

For a period of six years following the effective time of the first merger, Columbia or the surviving corporation will provide
director’s and officer’s liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Pacific Continental
or any of its subsidiaries as of the effective time of the first merger (providing only for the Side A coverage where the existing policies
also include Side B coverage for Pacific Continental) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events occurring before the effective time of the first merger (including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), which
insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to such persons
as that coverage currently provided by Pacific Continental, except that Columbia or the surviving corporation is not required to expend
in the aggregate for such six-year period, an amount in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premiums paid as of the date of the
merger agreement by Pacific Continental for any such insurance. If any such annual expense at any time would exceed that amount,
then Columbia will cause to be maintained policies of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to that amount, and officers and directors of Pacific Continental may be required to make applications and provide customary
representations and warranties to Columbia’s or the surviving corporation’s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance. Prior to the effective time of the first merger, and in lieu of the foregoing, Pacific Continental will use reasonable best efforts
to purchase a six-year prepaid tail policy for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance on the terms described above and subject to
certain other specifications agreed to by the parties, and fully pay for such policy prior to the effective time of the first merger, at an
aggregate cost up to, but not exceeding 200% of the current annual premium for such insurance.

No Solicitation; Change in Board Recommendation

The merger agreement provides that neither Pacific Continental, its subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors and
employees will, and will cause its and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, representatives, advisors and affiliates not to, initiate,
solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any
acquisition proposal (as defined below) or otherwise facilitate any effort to attempt or make or implement an acquisition proposal.
However, if at any time after the date of the merger agreement and prior to, but not after, obtaining the approval of the merger
agreement by Pacific Continental shareholders, Pacific Continental receives an unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposal and the
Pacific Continental board of directors concludes in good faith that such acquisition proposal constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
result in, a superior proposal (as defined below), then Pacific Continental and its board of directors may, and may permit its
subsidiaries and Pacific Continental’s and its subsidiaries’ representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information
and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Pacific Continental board of directors concludes in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that prior to providing any such nonpublic information or engaging in any such
negotiations, Pacific Continental must have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less restrictive in
the aggregate to the counterparty than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between Pacific Continental and Columbia, and
which expressly permits Pacific Continental to comply with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement. Pacific Continental will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted on or before the date of the merger
agreement with any persons other than Columbia with respect to

any acquisition proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar
agreement relating to an acquisition proposal and (ii) within ten business days after the date of the merger agreement, request and
confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other than Columbia and its affiliates)
pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement. Pacific Continental must promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Columbia following receipt of any acquisition proposal, of any discussions or negotiations that are sought to be initiated or continued
or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal and the
substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal), and keep Columbia promptly apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of any such request, inquiry or acquisition
proposal, or all amendments or proposed amendments thereto) on a current basis (it being understood that no such communications to
Columbia will be deemed an adverse change of recommendation (as defined below)). Pacific Continental agrees that it will
contemporaneously provide to Columbia any confidential or nonpublic information concerning Pacific Continental or any of its
subsidiaries that may be provided to any other person in connection with any acquisition proposal which has not previously been
provided to Columbia.

The term “acquisition proposal” means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other
business combination involving Pacific Continental or any of its subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more
than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, Pacific Continental or
any of its subsidiaries or any public announcement of a proposed plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreements to
engage in any of the foregoing, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and any sale of whole loans and
securitizations in the ordinary course. The term “superior proposal” means an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal that the
Pacific Continental board of directors concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders
than the first merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to be reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who must be a nationally recognized
investment banking or financial advisory firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the
terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of counsel), financial (including the financing terms
of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law, and after taking into account any amendment or modification
to the merger agreement agreed to by Columbia; provided that for purposes of the definition of superior proposal, the references to
“more than 15%” in the definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be references to “at least 50%.

None of the members of the Pacific Continental board of directors may, except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement,
withdraw or materially and adversely modify his or her recommendation that Pacific Continental shareholders vote to approve the
merger agreement, or recommend to Pacific Continental shareholders an acquisition proposal other than the first merger, which we
refer to as an adverse change of recommendation, or cause or commit Pacific Continental to enter into any agreement or understanding
other than the confidentiality agreement referred to above relating to any acquisition proposal made to Pacific Continental.
Nevertheless, in the event that Pacific Continental receives an acquisition proposal that the Pacific Continental board of directors
concludes in good faith constitutes a superior proposal, the Pacific Continental board of directors may make an adverse change of
recommendation or terminate the merger agreement, if it concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, as long as
Pacific Continental gives Columbia prior written notice at least five business days before taking such action and during such five-
business day period Pacific Continental negotiates in good faith with Columbia to enable Columbia to make an improved offer that is
at least as favorable to the shareholders of Pacific Continental as such alternative acquisition proposal.

to any party, a material adverse effect on (a) the business, assets or deposit liabilities, properties, operations, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that, with respect to this

in the banking industry in which such party and its subsidiaries operate; or (b) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time of the first merger and, as described
below under “Effect of Termination,” if the merger agreement is validly terminated, there will be no liability under the representations
and warranties of the parties, unless a party knowingly breached the merger agreement.

This summary and the copy of the merger agreement attached to this document as Appendix A are included solely to provide
investors with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. They are not intended to provide factual information about the
parties or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by Columbia
and Pacific Continental, which were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates. The representations, warranties
and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be subject to
limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of
allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts and may be subject
to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those generally applicable to investors. In reviewing the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement or any descriptions thereof in this summary, it is
important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof were not intended by the
parties to the merger agreement to be characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Columbia, Pacific Continental or any
of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and
covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in
Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s public disclosures. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or
any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone and should instead be read in conjunction with the other information
contained in the reports, statements and filings that Columbia and Pacific Continental publicly file with the SEC. For more information
regarding these documents, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the first merger, whether before or after
approval of matters presented in connection with the first merger to the shareholders of Columbia and Pacific Continental:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of Columbia and Pacific Continental;
 

 

•  by either Columbia or Pacific Continental, if a requisite regulatory approval is denied and such denial has become final and
non-appealable, or if a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction or
decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement;

 

 

•  by either Columbia or Pacific Continental, if the first merger has not closed by November 9, 2017, provided that, subject to
certain conditions, such date may be extended to January 9, 2018, unless the failure of the closing to occur by such date is
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth in the merger agreement;

 

 

•  by either Columbia or Pacific Continental, if there is a breach by the other party of any of its covenants, agreements,
representations or warranties that would, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches by such party, result in the
failure of a closing condition of the other party, and such breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the
party committing the breach, or the breach, by its nature, cannot be cured within such time (provided that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger
agreement);

 

 

•  by either Columbia or Pacific Continental, if (a) Pacific Continental shareholders have not approved the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby at the duly convened Pacific Continental special meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, or (b) Columbia shareholders have not approved the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first
merger at the duly convened Columbia special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, provided that the
failure to obtain such shareholder approval was not caused by the terminating party’s material breach of any of its
obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 

•  by Columbia prior to obtaining Pacific Continental shareholder approval, in the event (a) Pacific Continental breaches in any
material respect its non-solicitation obligations set forth in the merger agreement; (b) Pacific Continental or the Pacific
Continental board of directors make an adverse change of recommendation; (c) at any time after the end of five business
days following receipt of an acquisition proposal, the Pacific Continental board of directors fails to reaffirm its Pacific
Continental board recommendation as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five business days) after receipt of
any written request to do so by Columbia; or (d) a tender offer or exchange offer for Pacific Continental common shares is
publicly disclosed (other than by Columbia or one of its affiliates) and either (i) the Pacific Continental board of directors
recommends that its shareholders tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer, or (ii) within ten business days after
the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Pacific Continental board of directors fails to recommend
unequivocally against acceptance of such offer, which we refer to as a termination due to no Pacific Continental board
recommendation;

 

 

•  by Pacific Continental prior to obtaining Pacific Continental shareholder approval, in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for a superior proposal (provided that Pacific Continental is not in material breach of any of the terms
of the merger agreement and Pacific Continental pays Columbia a termination fee in advance of or concurrently with such
termination, as described below), which we refer to as a termination due to a superior proposal; or

 

 
•  by either Columbia or Pacific Continental immediately following the determination period, in the event that the Columbia

average closing price for the determination period is less than $26.13 (with a

proportionate adjustment in the event that outstanding Columbia common shares are changed into a different number of
shares by reason of any stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of the merger agreement and the end of the determination period); provided, however, if
Columbia elects to exercise such termination right, Pacific Continental will have the option of reinstating the first merger by
adjusting the exchange ratio to 0.6430 as may be adjusted for transaction expenses as described above, and adding to the
merger consideration an amount in cash equal to $1.048 per share. If Pacific Continental makes such election then no
termination will occur and the merger agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except for
the modifications to the merger consideration and the exchange ratio as described in the preceding sentence).

Pacific Continental must pay Columbia a termination fee of $18,7500,000 in the event that:
 

 
•  the merger agreement is terminated by Pacific Continental in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a

superior proposal;
 

 •  Columbia terminates the merger agreement due to no Pacific Continental board recommendation; or
 

 

•  any person has made an acquisition proposal, which proposal has been publicly announced, disclosed or proposed and not
withdrawn, and: (1) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated (a) by either party pursuant to the termination provision
for delay or pursuant to the termination provision for no approval by Pacific Continental shareholders or (b) by Columbia
pursuant to the termination provision for breach, and (2) within 12 months after such termination of the merger agreement,
an acquisition proposal is consummated or any definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal is entered into
(provided that references to “more than 15%” in the definition of acquisition proposal are deemed to be references to “at
least 50%”).

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is validly terminated, the merger agreement will become void and have no effect, and none of Pacific
Continental, Columbia, Merger Sub, any of their respective subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them will have any
liability of any nature whatsoever under the merger agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, except that (i) the provisions of the merger agreement relating to confidentiality obligations of the parties, the termination
fees, publicity and certain other technical provisions will continue in effect notwithstanding termination of the merger agreement and
(ii) neither Pacific Continental nor Columbia will be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its knowing
breach of the merger agreement (which, in the case of Pacific Continental includes the loss to Pacific Continental’s shareholders of the
economic benefits of the first merger).

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers

The merger agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at
any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the first merger by the shareholders of Pacific Continental
or Columbia, in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties, provided that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement by such shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of the merger
agreement that requires further approval under applicable law.

At any time prior to the effective time of the first merger, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or
waiver must be in writing

signed on behalf of such party. Any such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Fees and Expenses

Except for the termination fee, as described elsewhere in this document, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
mergers, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including costs and expenses of printing
and mailing this document) will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the first merger is completed.

Related Agreements

Pacific Continental Voting and Non-Competition Agreements

Each member of the Pacific Continental board of directors has entered into a voting and non-competition agreement with
Columbia and Pacific Continental pursuant to which such directors have agreed, until the earlier of the closing or the termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms, to vote his or her Pacific Continental common shares in favor of approval of (i) the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any other matter that is required to facilitate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and (iii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone the Pacific Continental special meeting to a later
date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement. Such directors have also agreed to vote against any action or
agreement submitted for approval to the shareholders of Pacific Continental that would (i) result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Pacific Continental under the merger agreement, (ii) result in any of
the conditions to the consummation of the first merger under the merger agreement not being fulfilled, (iii) be in competition with or
opposition to the merger agreement or the first merger, (iv) be an acquisition proposal or (v) impair the ability of Columbia to complete
the first merger, the ability of Pacific Continental to complete the first merger, or that would otherwise be inconsistent with, prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The voting and non-competition
agreements apply solely to the directors in their capacities as shareholders of Pacific Continental and do not prevent them from
discharging their fiduciary duties with respect to their roles on the Pacific Continental board of directors. As of April 12, 2017, the
directors who are parties to the voting and non-competition agreements have the right to vote, in the aggregate, 1,377,046 outstanding
Pacific Continental common shares, which represents approximately 5.99% of the outstanding Pacific Continental common shares.

The voting and non-competition agreements also provide that the directors will not transfer (other than for estate planning or
philanthropic purposes) the Pacific Continental common shares that they own until the earlier of the closing or the termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

The voting and non-competition agreements also prohibit the directors for a two-year period following the closing from
(a) soliciting or attempting to solicit (i) any employees or independent contractors of Columbia, Pacific Continental or the combined
company to participate in a competing business, (ii) any customers, business partners or joint venturers of Columbia, Pacific
Continental or the combined company to transfer their business to a competing business or to reduce their business or cease conducting
business with Columbia, Pacific Continental or the combined company or (iii) the termination of an employment or contractual
relationship between Columbia, Pacific Continental or the combined company and any employee, independent contractor, customer,
business partner or joint venturer, (b) hiring any employees who were then employed by the combined company or who were employed
by Columbia or Pacific Continental prior to the effective time of the first merger, subject to certain exceptions or (c) in any other way
interfering with or disrupting Columbia, Pacific Continental or the combined company’s relationship with any of its employees,
independent contractors, customers, business partners or joint venturers.

Pursuant to the voting and non-competition agreements, Pacific Continental directors party thereto have agreed to tender their
resignations from the Pacific Continental board of directors, subject to and effective upon the closing.

The voting and non-competition agreements terminate automatically in the event that the merger agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

Columbia Voting Agreement

Certain directors of Columbia have entered into voting agreements with Columbia and Pacific Continental pursuant to which such
directors have agreed, until the earlier of the closing or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, to vote
their Columbia common shares in favor of: (i) approval of the issuance of Columbia common shares pursuant to the merger agreement;
(ii) any other matter that is required to facilitate the issuance of Columbia common shares pursuant to the merger agreement; and
(iii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone the Columbia special meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the
issuance of Columbia common shares pursuant to the merger agreement. Such directors have also agreed to vote against any action or
agreement submitted for approval to the shareholders of Columbia that would (i) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Columbia under the merger agreement, (ii) result in any of the conditions to the
consummation of the first merger under the merger agreement not being fulfilled or (iii) impair the ability of Columbia to issue
Columbia common shares pursuant to the merger agreement. The voting agreements apply solely to the directors in their capacities as
shareholders of Columbia, and do not prevent them from discharging their fiduciary duties with respect to their roles on the Columbia
board of directors. As of April 12, 2017, the directors who are parties to the voting agreement have the right to vote, in the aggregate,
403,063 outstanding Columbia common shares, which represents approximately 0.69% of the outstanding Columbia common shares.

The voting agreements also provide that the directors will not transfer (other than for estate planning or philanthropic purposes)
the Columbia common shares that they own until the earlier of the closing or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance
with its terms.

The voting agreements terminate automatically in the event that the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGERS

This discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the first merger and the subsequent merger to
U.S. holders (as defined below) of Pacific Continental common shares. The discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S.
Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to change
(possibly with retroactive effect) and to differing interpretations.

For purposes of this discussion, we use the term “U.S. holder” to mean:
 

 •  a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the

laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust that (i) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons or

(ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
 

 •  an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its income regardless of its source.

This discussion applies only to Pacific Continental shareholders that hold their Pacific Continental common shares as a capital
asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment), and does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular U.S. holder in light of its personal circumstances or to U.S. holders subject
to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:
 

 •  financial institutions;
 

 •  investors in pass-through entities;
 

 •  persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;
 

 •  insurance companies;
 

 •  tax-exempt organizations;
 

 •  dealers in securities or currencies;
 

 •  traders in securities that elect to use a mark to market method of accounting;
 

 
•  persons that hold Pacific Continental common shares as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion

transaction;
 

 •  regulated investment companies;
 

 •  real estate investment trusts;
 

 •  retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred accounts;
 

 •  persons whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 •  persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States; and
 

 
•  shareholders who acquired their Pacific Continental common shares through the exercise of a Pacific Continental option or

Pacific Continental SAR, as a Pacific Continental RSU or as a Pacific Continental restricted stock award, or otherwise as
compensation.

If a partnership or other entity taxed as a partnership holds Pacific Continental common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in
the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in such a
partnership should consult their tax advisors about the tax consequences of the mergers to them.

Table of Contents

The actual tax consequences of the mergers to you may be complex and will depend on your specific situation and on factors that
are not within our control. You should consult with your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the mergers in your particular
circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution tax
and any state, local or foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger

It is a condition to Pacific Continental’s obligation to complete the first merger that Pacific Continental receives a written opinion
of its counsel, Pillsbury, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that the first merger and the subsequent merger, taken together, will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to Columbia’s obligation to complete the
first merger that Columbia receives an opinion of its counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that the
first merger and the subsequent merger, taken together, will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. These opinions will be based on the assumption that the first merger and the subsequent merger will be completed in the manner
set forth in the merger agreement and the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part, and on representation letters provided by Columbia and Pacific Continental to be delivered at the time of the closing. Those
opinions will also be based on the assumption that the representations found in the representation letters are, as of the effective time of
the first merger, true and complete without qualification and that the representation letters are executed by appropriate and authorized
officers of Columbia and Pacific Continental. If any of the assumptions or representations upon which such opinions are based is
inconsistent with the actual facts with respect to the first merger and the subsequent merger, the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the first merger and the subsequent merger could be adversely affected.

In addition, neither of the tax opinions given in connection with the first merger or in connection with the filing of this
registration statement will be binding on the Internal Revenue Service. Neither Columbia nor Pacific Continental intends to request any
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the first merger and the subsequent merger,
and consequently, there is no guarantee that the Internal Revenue Service will treat the first merger and the subsequent merger as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Assuming that the first merger and the subsequent merger are completed in the manner set forth in the merger agreement and the
registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and that the representations found in
representation letters provided by Columbia and Pacific Continental delivered on or about the date hereof will continue to be true and
complete without qualification as of the effective time of the first merger, it is the opinion of each of Sullivan & Cromwell and
Pillsbury that the first merger and the subsequent merger, taken together, will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

Based solely on the information, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein and in their
respective federal income tax opinions filed herewith, this discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the first
merger and subsequent merger, to the extent such discussion expresses conclusions as to the application of U.S. federal income tax law,
constitutes the opinions of Sullivan & Cromwell, counsel to Columbia, and Pillsbury, counsel to Pacific Continental.

Subject to the discussion below under the heading “—Alternative Consideration Scenario”, the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences will be as follows:
 

 
•  no gain or loss will be recognized by Columbia or Pacific Continental as a result of the first merger and the subsequent

merger;

Table of Contents

 

•  no gain or loss will be recognized by U.S. holders who receive Columbia common shares in exchange for Pacific
Continental common shares pursuant to the first merger (except for any gain or loss that may result from the receipt of cash
in lieu of fractional Columbia common shares that the U.S. holders would otherwise be entitled to receive (as discussed
below under “—Cash Received In Lieu of a Fractional Columbia Common Share”));

 

 
•  the aggregate basis of the Columbia common shares received in the first merger will be the same as the aggregate basis of

the Pacific Continental common shares surrendered in the exchange, decreased by any basis attributable to fractional
interests in Columbia common shares for which cash is received; and

 

 
•  the holding period of Columbia common shares received in exchange for Pacific Continental common shares will include

the holding period of the Pacific Continental common shares surrendered in the exchange.

If a U.S. holder of Pacific Continental common shares acquired different blocks of Pacific Continental common shares at different
times or at different prices, such holder’s basis and holding period may be determined with reference to each block of Pacific
Continental common shares. Any such holder should consult its tax advisors regarding the manner in which Columbia common shares
received in the exchange should be allocated among different blocks of Pacific Continental common shares and with respect to
identifying the bases or holding periods of the particular Columbia common shares received in the first merger.

Cash Received In Lieu of a Fractional Columbia Common Share

A U.S. holder of Pacific Continental common shares who receives cash in lieu of a fractional Columbia common share will be
treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the first merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share for cash in
a redemption by Columbia. As a result, a Pacific Continental shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received and the basis in his or her fractional share interest as set forth above. This gain or loss will
generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the first merger, the holding
period for such shares is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Alternative Consideration Scenario

If the Columbia average closing price for the determination period falls below certain thresholds and certain other conditions are
met (as described in more detail above under the headings “The Mergers—Terms of the Mergers—Merger Consideration”), holders of
Pacific Continental common shares may receive cash consideration in addition to Columbia common shares. In such case, the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences to the transaction would generally be the same as described above, except that:
 

 

•  A U.S. holder who receives Columbia common shares and cash (other than cash received in lieu of a fractional Columbia
common share) in exchange for Pacific Continental common shares pursuant to the first merger, will generally recognize
gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the
amount of cash and the fair market value of the Columbia common shares received pursuant to the first merger over such
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Pacific Continental common shares surrendered in the exchange) and (2) the amount
of cash received pursuant to the first merger (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional Columbia common share);
and

 

 

•  The aggregate tax basis in the Columbia common shares received by a U.S. holder of Pacific Continental common shares in
the first merger, including any fractional share interests deemed received and redeemed as described above, will equal such
U.S. holder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the Pacific Continental common shares surrendered in the exchange, reduced
by the amount of cash received (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of

Table of Contents

 
gain, if any, recognized by such U.S. holder (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of a
fractional share) on the exchange.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

A non-corporate U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) on any
cash received in the first merger, including cash received in lieu of a fractional Columbia common share. Backup withholding generally
will not apply, however, to such U.S. holders who:
 

 
•  furnish a correct taxpayer identification number, certify that they are not subject to backup withholding on the substitute

Form W-9 or successor form included in the letter of transmittal and otherwise comply with all the applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules; or

 

 •  provide proof that they are otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S.
federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the first merger and
the subsequent merger. It is not a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects that may be important to you. Thus, you are
strongly encouraged to consult your tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences resulting from the mergers, including tax return
reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of federal, state, local, and other tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in
the tax laws.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and explanatory notes show the impact on the
historical financial positions and results of operations of Columbia and Pacific Continental and have been prepared to illustrate the
effects of the mergers involving Columbia and Pacific Continental under the acquisition method of accounting with Columbia treated
as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Pacific Continental, as of the effective date of
the mergers, will be recorded by Columbia at their respective fair values and the excess of the merger consideration over the fair value
of Pacific Continental’s net assets will be allocated to goodwill. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of
December 31, 2016 is presented as if the mergers with Pacific Continental had occurred on December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 is presented as if the mergers had occurred on
January 1, 2016. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are
directly attributable to the mergers and, with respect to the income statements only, expected to have a continuing impact on
consolidated results of operations.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of the
period presented. The adjustments included in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are preliminary and
may be revised. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also does not consider any potential impacts of
potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and expense efficiencies, or asset dispositions, among other factors.

In addition, as explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information, the pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded at the time the mergers are
completed. Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) Pacific Continental’s balance sheet through the effective time
of the mergers; (ii) the aggregate value of merger consideration paid if the price of Columbia’s common shares vary from the assumed
$43.31 per share; (iii) total merger-related expenses if consummation and/or implementation costs vary from currently estimated
amounts; and (iv) the underlying values of assets and liabilities if market conditions differ from current assumptions.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily, and should not be assumed to be, an indication of the results
that would have been achieved had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The
preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and related adjustments required management to
make certain assumptions and estimates. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read together
with:
 

 •  the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements;
 

 
•  Columbia’s separate audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year

ended December 31, 2016, included in Columbia’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016;
 

 
•  Pacific Continental’s separate audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the

year ended December 31, 2016, included in Pacific Continental’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016, as amended; and

 

 
•  other information pertaining to Columbia and Pacific Continental contained in or, incorporated by reference into this joint

proxy statement/prospectus. See “Selected Consolidated Financial Data of Columbia” and “Selected Consolidated Financial
Data of Pacific Continental” included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information

Note 1—Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of
accounting giving effect to the mergers involving Columbia and Pacific Continental. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position had the
mergers been consummated at December 31, 2016 or the results of operations had the mergers been consummated at January 1, 2016,
nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operation in future periods or the future financial position of the combined entities. For
the historical income statements of Pacific Continental, amounts related to other real estate owned, which were historically reported in
noninterest income by Pacific Continental, have been reclassified to noninterest expense to conform to the presentation in Columbia’s
financial statements. The mergers, which are currently expected to be completed in mid-2017, provide for the issuance of 14,535,729
Columbia common shares and $14.6 million in cash (subject to adjustment based upon the effective time of the mergers). The value of
a Pacific Continental share would be $27.85 based upon a purchaser average closing price (as defined in the merger agreement) of
$43.31.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Pacific Continental will be recorded at the respective fair
values on the closing date. The fair value on the closing date represents management’s best estimates based on available information
and facts and circumstances in existence on the closing date. The pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that
will be recorded at the time the mergers are completed. Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) Pacific
Continental’s balance sheet through the effective time of the mergers; (ii) the aggregate value of merger consideration paid if the price
of Columbia’s common shares vary from the assumed $43.31 per share; (iii) total merger-related expenses if consummation and/or
implementation costs vary from currently estimated amounts; and (iv) the underlying values of assets and liabilities if market
conditions differ from current assumptions.

The accounting policies of both Columbia and Pacific Continental are in the process of being reviewed in detail. Upon
completion of such review, conforming adjustments or financial statement reclassification may be determined.

Note 2—Estimated Merger and Integration Costs

In connection with the mergers, the plan to integrate Columbia’s and Pacific Continental’s operations is still being developed.
Over the next several months, the specific details of these plans will continue to be refined. Columbia and Pacific Continental are
currently in the process of assessing the two companies’ personnel, benefit plans, premises, equipment, computer systems, supply
chain methodologies and service contracts to determine where they may take advantage of redundancies or where it will be beneficial
or necessary to convert to one system. Certain decisions arising from these assessments may involve involuntary termination of Pacific
Continental’s employees, vacating Pacific Continental’s leased premises, changing information systems, canceling contracts between
Pacific Continental and certain service providers and selling or otherwise disposing of certain premises, furniture and equipment
owned by Pacific Continental. Additionally, as part of our formulation of the integration plan, certain actions regarding existing
Columbia information systems, premises, equipment, benefit plans, supply chain methodologies, supplier contracts and involuntary
termination of personnel may be taken. Columbia expects to incur merger-related expenses including system conversion costs,
employee retention and severance agreements, communications to customers and others. To the extent there are costs associated with
these actions, the costs will be recorded based on the nature and timing of these integration actions. Most acquisition and restructuring
costs are recognized separately from a business combination and generally will be expensed as incurred. We estimated the merger-
related costs to be approximately $30.4 million and expect they will be incurred primarily in 2017.

Note 3—Estimated Annual Cost Savings

Columbia expects to realize $19.4 million in annual pre-tax cost savings following the mergers, which management expects to be
phased-in over a two-year period, but there is no assurance that the anticipated cost savings will be realized on the anticipated time
schedule or at all. These cost savings are not reflected in the presented pro forma financial information.

Note 4—Pro Forma Adjustments

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
All taxable adjustments were calculated using a 35% tax rate to arrive at deferred tax asset or liability adjustments. All adjustments are
based on current assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change.

Balance Sheet
(dollars in thousands)
 
A.    Adjustments to cash and cash equivalents     

To reflect cash used to purchase Pacific Continental.     $ (14,572) 
To reflect cash used to redeem Pacific Continental junior subordinated debentures.      (14,000) 

      
 

    $ (28,572) 
      

 

B.    Adjustment to loans, net of unearned income     

To reflect estimated fair value at closing date, calculated as 1.7% of the Pacific Continental loan
balance. The fair value estimate was measured by Columbia utilizing an income approach. In this
approach, the Pacific Continental loans held for investment were aggregated into pools with similar
risk characteristics and pool-level cash flows were projected. Cash flow projection assumptions
included, but were not limited to, expected loss and prepayment which were measured using
migration analyses and available market data. The rates used to discount the cash flows took into
account servicing costs, capital charges and market benchmark rates of similar collateral and loan
purposes and were derived from recent originations, available market data and spread build-up
approaches.     $ (31,616) 

C.    Adjustment to allowance for loan and lease losses     

To remove Pacific Continental allowance at closing date as the credit risk is contemplated in the fair
value adjustment in adjustment B above.     $ (22,454) 

D.    Adjustment to premises and equipment     

To reflect estimated fair value of Pacific Continental properties at closing date. The estimated useful life
of these properties is 39 years.     $ 2,800 

E.    Adjustment to other real estate owned     

To reflect estimated fair value of Pacific Continental other real estate owned at closing date based on
Columbia’s estimate of property values given current market conditions and additional discounts
necessary to liquidate these properties.      (2,300) 

F.    Adjustment to goodwill     

To reverse Pacific Continental Goodwill on the books     $ (61,401) 

To reflect the goodwill associated with the Pacific Continental mergers.      426,158

DESCRIPTION OF COLUMBIA’S CAPITAL STOCK

Columbia’s authorized capital stock consists of 115,000,000 common shares, no par value per share, and 2,000,000 preferred
shares, no par value per share, of which 76,898 were designated Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A and 8,782
were designated as Mandatorily Convertible Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock, Series B.

Common Shares

General

The holders of Columbia common shares have one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of Columbia’s shareholders.
There are no cumulative voting rights for the election of directors. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive ratably such
dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of legally available funds, subject to preferences that may be applicable to
any outstanding series of preferred stock. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Columbia, the holders of common
shares are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding
preferred shares. Holders of Columbia common shares have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, sinking fund or conversion
rights.

Dividends

The holders of Columbia common shares are entitled to receive dividends declared by Columbia’s board of directors out of funds
legally available therefor. Holders of preferred shares and debt securities, however, have a priority right to distributions and payment
over Columbia common shares. Columbia’s ability to pay dividends basically depends on the amount of dividends paid by Columbia’s
subsidiaries. The payment of dividends is subject to government regulation, in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank
holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. In addition, a bank
may not pay cash dividends if doing so would reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum regulatory
capital requirements. State laws also limit a bank’s ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, the dividend restrictions imposed on
Columbia’s subsidiaries by statute or regulation effectively may limit the amount of dividends Columbia can pay.

Columbia common shares are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol “COLB.”

For additional information concerning Columbia’s common shares, see “Comparison of Certain Rights of Holders of Columbia
and Pacific Continental Common Shares” below.

Preferred Shares

Under the Columbia articles, Columbia’s board of directors has the authority, without any further vote or action by Columbia’s
shareholders, to issue 2,000,000 preferred shares.

COMPARISON OF CERTAIN RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF COLUMBIA AND PACIFIC
CONTINENTAL COMMON SHARES

General

Pacific Continental is incorporated under the laws of the State of Oregon and the rights of Pacific Continental shareholders are
governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, the Pacific Continental articles and the Pacific Continental bylaws. As a result of the first
merger, Pacific Continental shareholders will receive Columbia common shares and will become Columbia shareholders. Columbia is
incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington and the rights of Columbia shareholders are governed by the laws of the State
of Washington, the Columbia articles and the Columbia bylaws. Thus, following the first merger, the rights of Pacific Continental
shareholders who become Columbia shareholders in the first merger will no longer be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, the
Pacific Continental articles and the Pacific Continental bylaws and instead will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, as
well as by the Columbia articles and the Columbia bylaws.

Comparison of Shareholders’ Rights

Set forth below is a summary comparison of material differences between the rights of Columbia shareholders under the
Columbia articles, the Columbia bylaws and Washington law (right column), and the rights of Pacific Continental shareholders under
the Pacific Continental articles, Pacific Continental bylaws and Oregon law (left column). The summary set forth below is not intended
to provide a comprehensive discussion of each company’s governing documents. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the Columbia articles and Columbia bylaws, the Pacific Continental articles and Pacific Continental bylaws, the
Oregon Revised Statutes, which we refer to as the ORS, and the Washington Business Corporation Act, which we refer to as the
WBCA.
 
Pacific Continental   Columbia
Authorized Capital Stock

The Pacific Continental articles authorize the issuance of up to
50,000,000 Pacific Continental common shares and 20,000 preferred
shares, each without par value. As of the record date, there were
22,667,111 Pacific Continental common shares and no preferred
shares issued and outstanding. 569,397 Pacific Continental common
shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Pacific
Continental options, Pacific Continental RSUs and Pacific
Continental SARs.   

The Columbia articles authorize Columbia to issue
115,000,000 common shares, no par value per share, and
2,000,000 preferred shares, no par value per share. As of the
record date, there were 58,328,142 Columbia common shares
outstanding.

Voting Rights   

The Pacific Continental articles provide that each holder of Pacific
Continental common shares will have full voting rights, with each
share entitling the holder thereof to one vote.

  

The Columbia bylaws provide that each holder of Columbia
common shares will be entitled to one vote for each share held
of record by such holder on all matters on which shareholders
are generally entitled to vote.

Number of Directors   

The Pacific Continental articles and the Pacific Continental bylaws
provide that the number of directors will not be fewer than six nor
more than 15, with the exact number determined from time to time
by resolution of the Pacific Continental board of directors. The
Pacific Continental board of directors currently has 13 directors.   

The Columbia bylaws provide that the number of directors will
not be fewer than five or more than 17, with the exact number
to be fixed by resolution of the board of directors. Columbia’s
board of directors currently has 11 directors.

Pacific Continental   Columbia
Removal of Directors   

Oregon law provides that the shareholders of a corporation may
remove directors with or without cause unless the articles of
incorporation provide that directors may be removed only for cause.
A director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to
remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove
the director and only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing
one or more directors. The meeting notice must state that the purpose
or one of the purposes of the meeting is removal of the director.   

Under the WBCA, a director may be removed from office with
or without cause if the number of votes cast to remove the
director exceeds the number cast not to remove the director at a
special meeting called for the purpose of removing the director.

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors   

Subject to Oregon law, vacancies on the Pacific Continental board of
directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors, though less than a quorum, at a meeting of the
Pacific Continental board of directors after the vacancy occurs. Each
director so elected and approved will hold office until the next
shareholder meeting at which directors are elected and until such
director’s qualified successor is elected and accepts office.   

The Columbia bylaws provide that any vacancy occurring on
the board may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the remaining directors whether or not less than a quorum. If
the vacant office was held by a director elected by holders of
one or more authorized classes or series of shares, only the
holders of those classes or series of shares are entitled to vote
to fill the vacancy.

Shareholder Proposals and Nominations   

Under the Pacific Continental bylaws, to properly place any action
on the agenda for an annual meeting, a shareholder must deliver
written notice of the proposal not less than 120 calendar days in
advance of the anniversary of the date on which Pacific
Continental’s proxy statement was mailed to shareholders for the
preceding year’s annual meeting.
 
Each notice must set forth:
 

•    a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the meeting;

 

•    the name and address, as they appear on Pacific Continental’s
books, of the shareholder proposing such business;

 

•    the class and number of shares of Pacific Continental which
are owned beneficially by the shareholder;

 

•    any material interest of the shareholder in such business; and
 

•    any other information that is required to be provided by the
shareholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange
Act in such   

The Columbia bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure
for shareholders to make nominations of candidates for election
as directors, or to bring other business before an annual
meeting of shareholders. Only persons who are nominated by,
or at the direction of, Columbia’s board of directors, or by a
shareholder who has given timely written notice to the
corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which directors are
to be elected, are eligible for election as directors of Columbia.
The business to be conducted at an annual meeting is limited to
business brought before the meeting by, or at the direction of,
the Columbia board of directors or by a shareholder who has
given timely written notice to the secretary of his or her
intention to bring such business before such meeting.
 
Notice of a shareholder nomination or other business to be
brought before an annual meeting will be timely only if it is
delivered to Columbia no earlier than the 150th day and no
later than the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event
that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before
or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice

Voting Rights in an Extraordinary Transaction   

In addition to the provisions described below in “Anti-Takeover
Provisions and Other Shareholder Protections,” Oregon law requires
that a plan of merger be approved by a majority of votes entitled to
be cast by shareholders.

  

In accordance with the WBCA, the Columbia articles impose
heightened shareholder requirements for certain Business
Combinations (as defined in the Columbia articles). These
provisions are described below under “Anti-Takeover
Provisions and Other Shareholder Protections.”

Anti-Takeover Provisions and Other Shareholder Protections   

Oregon law prohibits, except under certain circumstances, a
“business combination” (defined broadly to include mergers or
consolidations, certain sales, sales of assets, liquidation or
dissolution and other specified transactions) between a corporation
and an “interested shareholder” (defined generally as a person or
group that directly or indirectly controls, or has the right to control,
the voting or disposition of 15% or more of outstanding voting
stock) within three years of the shareholder becoming an interested
shareholder.
 
A business combination between a corporation and an interested
shareholder is prohibited unless (1) prior to the date the person
became an interested shareholder, the board of directors approved
either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in
the person becoming an interested shareholder, (2) upon
consummation of the transaction that resulted in the person
becoming an interested shareholder, that person owns at least 85% of
the corporation’s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction
is commenced (excluding shares owned by persons who are both   

Washington law prohibits corporations that have a class of
voting stock registered under the Exchange Act, such as
Columbia, from engaging in any “Significant Business
Transaction” (defined to include mergers or consolidations,
certain sales, termination of 5% or more of a corporation’s
employees, sales of assets, liquidation or dissolution and other
specified transactions) with a person or group that beneficially
owns ten percent or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting
stock, which we refer to as an acquiring person, for a period of
five years after such person or group becomes an acquiring
person, unless the Significant Business Transaction or the
acquisition by which such person became an acquiring person
is approved prior to the time the person became an acquiring
person by a majority vote of the board of directors, or the
Significant Business Combination is approved by a majority
vote of the board of directors and approved at an annual or
special meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at
least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares (excluding

directors and officers and shares owned by employee stock plans in
which participants do not have the right to determine confidentially
whether shares will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer), or
(3) the business combination is approved by the board of directors
and authorized by the affirmative vote (at an annual or special
meeting and not by written consent) of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested shareholder.
 
The Oregon Control Share Act, codified at ORS Sections 60.801
through 60.816, restricts a shareholder’s ability to vote shares
acquired in certain transactions not approved by the board of
directors that cause the acquiring person to gain control of a voting
position exceeding one-fifth, one-third, or one-half of the votes
entitled to be cast in an election of directors. Shares acquired in a
control share acquisition have no voting rights except as authorized
by a vote of the shareholders. If the acquiror’s control shares are
allowed to have voting rights and represent a majority or more of all
voting power, shareholders who do not vote in favor of voting rights
for the control shares will have the right to receive the appraised fair
value of their shares, which may not be less than the highest price
paid per share by the acquiror for the control shares.
 
 
 

  

shares beneficially owned by or under the voting control of the
acquiring person).
The Columbia articles include certain provisions that could
make more difficult the acquisition of Columbia by means of a
tender offer, a proxy contest, merger or otherwise. These
provisions include: (i) certain non-monetary factors that the
Columbia board of directors may consider when evaluating a
takeover offer, and (ii) a requirement that any “Business
Combination” (as defined in the Columbia articles) be
approved by the affirmative vote of not less than 66 2/3% of
the total shares attributable to persons other than a “Control
Person” (as defined in the Columbia articles), unless certain
conditions are met, including that a majority of the Continuing
Directors (as defined in the Columbia articles) has approved
the transaction or certain other conditions concerning (among
other things) non-discrimination among shareholders and
receipt of fair value are satisfied.
 
In addition, the authorization of preferred stock, which is
intended primarily as a financing tool and not as a defensive
measure against takeovers, may potentially be used by
management to make more difficult uninvited attempts to
acquire control of Columbia (for example, by diluting the
ownership interest of a substantial shareholder, increasing the
amount of consideration necessary for a shareholder to obtain
control or selling authorized but unissued shares to friendly
third parties).
 
The Columbia articles allow the Columbia board of directors to
consider non-monetary factors in evaluating certain takeover
bids. Specifically, the Columbia articles allow the board of
directors, in determining what is in the best interests of
Columbia and its shareholders, to consider all relevant factors,
including the social and economic effects on its employees,
customers, suppliers and other constituents of Columbia and its
subsidiaries and on the communities in which Columbia and its
subsidiaries operate or are located.
 
The matters described above may have the effect of increasing
the amount of time required for a person to acquire control of
Columbia through a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise,
and may deter any potentially unfriendly offers or other efforts
to obtain control of Columbia. This could deprive Columbia’s
shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium

for their Columbia common shares, even in circumstances
where such action was favored by a majority of Columbia
shareholders.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers   

Under Oregon law, a corporation may indemnify a director for
actions taken in good faith and which the director reasonably
believed to be in the best interests of the corporation. In the case of a
criminal proceeding, the director must not have had any reasonable
cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. A director may not be
indemnified in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation in which the director was found liable to the corporation,
or a proceeding in which the director was found to have improperly
received a personal benefit. Oregon law further provides for
mandatory indemnification of officers and directors for reasonable
expenses incurred when the indemnified party is wholly successful
in the defense of the proceeding. A corporation may indemnify
officers to the same extent as directors.
 
The Pacific Continental articles grant a right to indemnification to
any person who is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any action,
suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and whether formal or informal, and whether by or in
the right of Pacific Continental or its shareholders or by any other
party, by reason of the fact that the person:
 

1)      is or was a director of Pacific Continental;
 

2)      is or was simultaneously both an officer and director of
Pacific Continental;

 

3)      while not principally employed by Pacific Continental or
any subsidiary at least 80% of which is controlled by Pacific
Continental, is or was a director or manager of an at least
80% controlled subsidiary of Pacific Continental; or

 

4)      for any person identified in (1) through (3) above, was or is
serving at the request of Pacific Continental or any subsidiary
at least 80% of which is controlled by Pacific Continental as
a director, officer, manager, partner, trustee, employee or
agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise or is a fiduciary or party in interest in   

Sections 23B.08.500 through 23B.08.603 of the WBCA
contain specific provisions relating to indemnification of
directors and officers of Washington corporations. In general,
the statute provides that a corporation may indemnify an
individual made a party to a proceeding because the individual
is or was a director against liability incurred in the proceeding
if: (i) the individual acted in good faith; and (ii) the individual
reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in the individual’s
official capacity, that the individual’s conduct was in the best
interests of the corporation, and in all other cases, that the
individual’s conduct was at least not opposed to the
corporation’s best interests. In the case of a criminal
proceeding, the individual must not have had any reasonable
cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.
 
A director may not be indemnified in connection with a
proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the
director was found liable to the corporation, or a proceeding in
which the director was found to have improperly received a
personal benefit. Washington law provides for mandatory
indemnification of directors for reasonable expenses incurred
when the indemnified party is wholly successful in the defense
of the proceeding. A corporation may indemnify officers to the
same extent as directors.
 
Washington law permits a director of a corporation who is a
party to a proceeding to apply to the courts for indemnification
or advance of expenses, unless the articles of incorporation
provide otherwise, and the court may order indemnification or
advancement of expenses under certain circumstances set forth
in the statute. Washington law further provides that a
corporation may, if authorized by its articles of incorporation or
a bylaw or resolution adopted or ratified by the shareholders,
provide indemnification in addition to that provided by statute,
subject to certain conditions set forth in the statute.

relation to any employee benefit plan covering any employee of
Pacific Continental or of any employer in which it has an ownership
interest, against judgments, penalties or penalty taxes, fines,
settlements (even if paid or payable to Pacific Continental or its
shareholders or to an at least 80% controlled subsidiary of Pacific
Continental) and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees,
actually incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding
unless the liability and expenses were on account of conduct
determined by a court having jurisdiction and from which there is no
further right to appeal to involve acts or omissions involving
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, participation
in any transaction from which the person will personally receive a
benefit in money, property or services to which the person is not
legally entitled, an unlawful distribution under the Oregon Bank Act
and conduct for which the person is adjudged liable to Pacific
Continental.
 
The Pacific Continental articles provide that reasonable expenses,
including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with an action, suit
or proceeding in which the individual is entitled to indemnification
will be paid or reimbursed by Pacific Continental, upon request of
such person, in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of a written, unsecured
promise by the person to repay such amount if a court having
jurisdiction and from which there is no further right of appeal has
determined that the person is not eligible for indemnification. All
expenses incurred by such person in connection with such action,
suit or proceeding will be considered reasonable unless a court
having jurisdiction, and from which there is no further right of
appeal, has determined that they are unreasonable.
 
Notwithstanding the indemnification provisions above, the Pacific
Continental articles provide that Pacific Continental will not
indemnify any person for expenses incurred as a result of (1) any
breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to Pacific Continental or its
shareholders; (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3)
any unlawful distribution; or (4) any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit.   

The Columbia articles provide, among other things, for the
indemnification of directors, and authorize the board of
directors to pay reasonable expenses incurred by, or satisfy a
judgment or fine against, a current or former director in
connection with any legal liability incurred by the individual
while acting for Columbia within the scope of his or her
employment and which was not the result of conduct finally
adjudged to be “egregious” conduct. “Egregious” conduct is
defined to include intentional misconduct, a knowing violation
of law, conduct violating Section 23B of the WBCA or
participation in any transaction from which the person will
receive a benefit in money, property or services to which that
person is not legally entitled.
 
The Columbia articles also include a provision that limits the
liability of directors from any personal liability to Columbia or
its shareholders for conduct not to have been found egregious.

Notwithstanding the indemnification provisions above, Pacific
Continental will provide indemnification and advancement of
expenses in connection with either an administrative proceeding or a
civil action instituted by a federal banking agency to the extent
permitted, and in the manner prescribed by the state or federal laws
or regulations applicable to Pacific Continental, or any formal
policies adopted by a regulatory agency having jurisdiction over
Pacific Continental.   

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws   

Under Oregon law, an amendment to the articles of incorporation is
generally approved if, upon approval by the board of directors and
referral to the shareholders, a quorum exists and the votes cast
favoring the amendment exceed the votes cast opposing the
amendment, unless the amendment would create dissenters’ rights,
in which case a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the
amendment is required to approve the amendment.
 
Under Oregon law, a corporation’s board of directors may amend or
repeal the corporation’s bylaws unless the corporation’s articles of
incorporation or Oregon law reserves the power to amend the bylaws
exclusively to the shareholders in whole or in part, or the
shareholders, in amending or repealing a particular bylaw, provide
expressly that the board of directors may not amend or repeal that
bylaw. A corporation’s shareholders may also amend or repeal the
bylaws. The Pacific Continental bylaws are consistent with the
statutory requirements.
 
The Pacific Continental bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed
by a majority vote of the Pacific Continental board of directors at
any regular meeting of the Pacific Continental board of directors or
any special meeting called for that purpose.

  

Under the WBCA, the Columbia articles may be amended if
(subject to certain exceptions if the board of directors
determines that it has a conflict of interest) the amendment is
recommended by the board of directors to the shareholders and
approved upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of Columbia’s outstanding voting stock. The provisions of the
Columbia articles relating to Business Combinations (as
defined in the Columbia articles) may not be amended or
repealed without the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of Columbia’s
outstanding voting stock (excluding any shares owned by a
Control Person). The Columbia board of directors may make
certain amendments, as listed in the WBCA, to the Columbia
articles without shareholder approval.
 
Under the WBCA, a corporation’s board of directors may
amend or repeal the corporation’s bylaws unless the
corporation’s articles of incorporation or Washington law
reserves the power to amend the bylaws exclusively to the
shareholders in whole or in part, or the shareholders, in
amending or repealing a particular bylaw, provide expressly
that the board of directors may not amend or repeal that bylaw.
A corporation’s shareholders may also amend or repeal the
bylaws.
 
The Columbia articles provide that the board of directors may,
by a majority vote of the whole board of directors, amend the
Columbia bylaws.

Under Oregon law, a shareholder is entitled to dissent from, and

COLUMBIA SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

Date, Time and Place

The special meeting of shareholders of Columbia will be held on June 8, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. local time, at 1301 “A” Street, Suite
800, Tacoma, Washington 98402.

Purpose

At the Columbia special meeting, shareholders of Columbia will:
 

 •  consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the issuance of Columbia common shares in the first merger; and
 

 
•  consider and vote upon a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Columbia special meeting, if necessary or

appropriate, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Columbia share issuance proposal.

Columbia Share Issuance Proposal

The merger agreement between Columbia and Pacific Continental provides that Columbia will issue a total of approximately
14,535,729 Columbia common shares. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules a company listed on Nasdaq is required to obtain shareholder
approval prior to the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in connection with the
acquisition of stock, or assets of another company if the common stock has or will have upon issuance voting power equal to or in
excess of 20% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance of stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common
stock, or the number of shares of common stock to be issued is or will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of
common stock outstanding before the issuance of the stock or securities. If the first merger is completed, the number of Columbia
common shares issued will exceed 20% of the Columbia common shares outstanding before such issuance. Accordingly, Columbia
must obtain the approval of Columbia shareholders for the issuance of Columbia common shares in connection with the first merger.

Columbia Adjournment Proposal

If, at the Columbia special meeting, the number of Columbia common shares present or represented by proxy and voting in favor
of the Columbia share issuance proposal is insufficient to approve such proposal, Columbia intends to move to adjourn the Columbia
special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies for such proposal.

In this proposal, Columbia is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Columbia board of
directors to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to proxy holders to adjourn the Columbia special meeting to another time
and/or place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If Columbia shareholders approve the Columbia adjournment proposal,
Columbia could adjourn the Columbia special meeting and any adjourned session of the Columbia special meeting and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies.

Columbia does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the Columbia share issuance proposal has been approved at the
Columbia special meeting.

Recommendations of the Columbia Board of Directors

The Columbia board of directors recommends that Columbia shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the Columbia share
issuance proposal and “FOR” approval of the Columbia adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

Record Date and Quorum

The Columbia board of directors has fixed April 12, 2017, as the record date for determining the holders of Columbia common
shares entitled to notice of and to vote at the Columbia special meeting. At the close of business on April 12, 2017, there were
58,328,142 Columbia common shares issued and outstanding, held by approximately 2,835 holders of record. Holders of record of
Columbia common shares on the record date are entitled to one vote per share.

Each of the directors of Columbia has agreed to vote all shares held or controlled by him or her in favor of approval of the
Columbia share issuance proposal. As of April 12, 2017, a total of 403,063 outstanding shares, or 0.69% of the outstanding Columbia
common shares, are covered by the Columbia voting agreements. See “The Merger Agreement—Related Agreements.”

The representation (in person or by proxy) of holders of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Columbia special
meeting constitutes a quorum for action at the Columbia special meeting. All Columbia common shares present in person or
represented by proxy, including abstentions and broker non-votes, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or
absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the Columbia special meeting.

Required Vote

Columbia Share Issuance Proposal

In accordance with the Columbia bylaws, the number of votes cast favoring the Columbia share issuance proposal must exceed
the number of votes cast opposing the Columbia share issuance proposal to approve the Columbia share issuance proposal.

Columbia Adjournment Proposal

In accordance with the Columbia bylaws, the number of votes cast favoring the Columbia adjournment proposal must exceed the
number of votes cast opposing the Columbia adjournment proposal to approve the Columbia adjournment proposal.

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote

For purposes of the Columbia special meeting, an abstention occurs when a Columbia shareholder attends the Columbia special
meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting. For purposes of the Columbia share issuance proposal and the
Columbia adjournment proposal, if a Columbia shareholder present in person at the Columbia special meeting abstains from voting,
responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote or is not present in person at the Columbia special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it
will have no effect on the vote on these proposals.

How to Vote

If you own Columbia common shares in your own name, you are an “owner of record.” This means that you may use the enclosed
proxy card(s) to tell the persons named as proxies how to vote your Columbia common shares. An owner of record has four voting
options:

Internet

You can vote over the Internet by accessing www.proxyvote.com. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day. Have your proxy
card in hand when you access the website and follow the instructions to vote.

Table of Contents

Telephone

You can vote on any touch-tone telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day. Have your
proxy card in hand when you call and follow the instructions to vote.

Mail

You can vote by mail by completing, signing, dating and mailing your proxy card(s) in the postage-paid envelope included with
this document.

In Person

You may attend the Columbia special meeting and cast your vote in person. The Columbia board of directors recommends that
you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Columbia special meeting.

The internet and telephone proxy procedures are designed to authenticate shareholder identification, to allow shareholders to give
their proxy voting instructions and to confirm that these instructions have been properly recorded. Directing the voting of your
Columbia common shares will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the Columbia special meeting.

Shares Held in Street Name

If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must provide the record
holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank or
broker. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Columbia or by voting in
person at the Columbia special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other
nominee.

Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares in street name for a beneficial owner typically have the authority to vote in
their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers, banks or
other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are determined to be “non-routine” without specific
instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are represented at the
applicable shareholders meeting but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner
of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and the broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on
such proposal.

If you are a Columbia shareholder, and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your
broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Columbia share issuance proposal or the Columbia adjournment
proposal, which broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote on these proposals.

Revoking Your Proxy

You may revoke your proxy at any time after you give it, and before it is voted, in one of the following ways:
 

 
•  by notifying Columbia’s Corporate Secretary at 1301 “A” Street, Tacoma, Washington 98402, stating that you are revoking

your proxy by written notice that bears a date later than the date of your proxy and that Columbia receives prior to the
Columbia special meeting and that states that you revoke your proxy;

 

 •  by voting again using the telephone or internet voting procedures;

Table of Contents

 
•  by signing another Columbia proxy card bearing a later date and mailing it so that Columbia receives it prior to the

Columbia special meeting; or
 

 
•  by attending the Columbia special meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the Columbia special meeting alone

will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

If you choose the first method, you must take the described action no later than the beginning of the Columbia special meeting. If
you choose the second method, you must take the described action no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the
Columbia special meeting. If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new
proxy card must be received before the beginning of the Columbia special meeting.

If your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares in street name, you will need to contact your broker, bank or other
nominee to revoke your voting instructions.

Attending the Columbia Special Meeting

The Columbia special meeting will be held at 1301 “A” Street, Suite 800, Tacoma, Washington 98402, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific
Time, on June 8, 2017. Subject to space availability, all shareholders of Columbia as of the Columbia record date, or their duly
appointed proxies, may attend the Columbia special meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the Columbia special meeting will
be on a first-come, first served basis. Registration and seating will begin at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time.

Please bring proper identification, together with proof that you are a record owner of Columbia common shares. If your shares are
held in street name, please bring acceptable proof of ownership, such as a letter from your broker or an account statement showing that
you beneficially owned common shares of Columbia on the record date. You should also bring valid picture identification.

Solicitation of Proxies

Columbia is soliciting proxies for the Columbia special meeting on behalf of the Columbia board of directors. Columbia will bear
the cost of soliciting proxies from its shareholders. In addition to using the mails, Columbia may solicit proxies by personal interview,
telephone and facsimile. Banks, brokerage houses, other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries will be requested to forward their proxy
soliciting material to their principals and obtain authorization for the execution of proxies. Columbia does not expect to pay any
compensation for the solicitation of proxies. However, Columbia will, upon request, pay the standard charges and expenses of banks,
brokerage houses, other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding proxy materials to and obtaining proxies from their
principals.

Delivery of Proxy Materials To Shareholders Sharing an Address

As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to multiple
shareholders of Columbia sharing an address unless Columbia has previously received contrary instructions from one or more such
shareholders. This is referred to as “householding.” Shareholders who hold shares in “street name” can request further information on
householding through their banks, brokers or other holders of record. On written or oral request to Columbia Investor Relations, P.O.
Box 2156 MS 3100, Tacoma, Washington 98402, (253)-305-1921, Columbia will deliver promptly a separate copy of this document to
a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered.

COLUMBIA PROPOSALS

Columbia Share Issuance Proposal

As discussed throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Columbia is asking its shareholders to approve the issuance of
Columbia common shares in connection with the first merger. Holders of Columbia common shares should carefully read this
document in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the mergers. In
particular, holders of Columbia common shares are directed to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this
document.

The Columbia board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the Columbia share issuance proposal.

Columbia Adjournment Proposal

The Columbia special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Columbia special meeting to approve the Columbia share issuance proposal.

If, at the Columbia special meeting, the number of Columbia common shares present or represented and voting in favor of the
Columbia share issuance proposal is insufficient to approve the Columbia share issuance proposal, Columbia intends to move to
adjourn the Columbia special meeting in order to enable the Columbia board of directors to solicit additional proxies for approval of
the merger agreement. In that event, Columbia will ask its shareholders to vote only upon the Columbia adjournment proposal, and not
the Columbia share issue proposal.

In this proposal, Columbia is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Columbia board of
directors to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the
Columbia special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the Columbia shareholders
approve the Columbia adjournment proposal, Columbia could adjourn the Columbia special meeting and use the additional time to
solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from Columbia shareholders who have previously voted.

The Columbia board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the Columbia adjournment proposal.

Other Matters to Come Before the Columbia Special Meeting

No other matters are intended to be brought before the Columbia special meeting by Columbia, and Columbia does not know of
any matters to be brought before the Columbia special meeting by others. If, however, any other matters properly come before the
Columbia special meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares represented thereby in accordance with the judgment of
management on any such matter.

enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly executed, the Pacific Continental common shares
represented by it will be voted at the Pacific Continental special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on the proxy
card.

If any proxy is returned without indication as to how to vote, the Pacific Continental common shares represented by the proxy
will be voted as recommended by the Pacific Continental board of directors. Unless a Pacific Continental shareholder checks the box
on the proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the proxyholders may use their discretion to vote on other matters relating to the
Pacific Continental special meeting.

If a Pacific Continental shareholder’s Pacific Continental common shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other
nominee, the shareholder should check the voting form used by that firm to determine whether it may vote by telephone or the Internet.

Every Pacific Continental shareholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each Pacific Continental shareholder should sign,
date and return the enclosed proxy card, or vote via the Internet or by telephone, whether or not the shareholder plans to
attend the Pacific Continental special meeting in person.

Shares Held in Street Name

If you are a Pacific Continental shareholder and your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other holder of
record, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting
instructions provided by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Pacific
Continental or by voting in person at the Pacific Continental special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must
obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold Pacific Continental common
shares on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to Pacific Continental to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals
without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on
these matters. Therefore, if you are a Pacific Continental shareholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee
on how to vote your shares:
 

 
•  your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the merger proposal, which broker non-votes will have the

same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal;
 

 
•  your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the merger-related named executive officer compensation

proposal, which broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote count for this proposal; and
 

 
•  your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on the Pacific Continental adjournment proposal, which broker

non-votes will have no effect on the vote count for this purpose.

Revoking Your Proxy

A Pacific Continental shareholder has the power to change such shareholder’s vote at any time before such shareholder’s Pacific
Continental common shares are voted at the Pacific Continental special meeting by:
 

 
•  sending a notice of revocation to Pacific Continental’s corporate secretary at 111 West 7th Avenue, Eugene, Oregon 97401,

stating that you would like to revoke your proxy;
 

 
•  logging onto the Internet website specified on your proxy card in the same manner you would to submit your proxy

electronically or by calling the telephone number specified on your proxy card, in each case if you are eligible to do so and
following the instructions on the proxy card;

 

 •  sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card; or
 

 
•  attending the Pacific Continental special meeting and voting in person if your Pacific Continental common shares are

registered in your name rather than in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee.

If you choose either of the first two methods listed immediately above, you must take the described action no later than the
beginning of the Pacific Continental special meeting. If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your
original proxy card, the new proxy card must be received before the beginning of the Pacific Continental special meeting. If you have
instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your Pacific Continental common shares, you must follow the directions you receive
from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to change or revoke your vote.

Attending the Pacific Continental Special Meeting

Subject to space availability, all Pacific Continental shareholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend
the Pacific Continental special meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the Pacific Continental special meeting will be on a first-
come, first-served basis. Registration and seating will begin at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time.

If you hold your Pacific Continental common shares in your name as a shareholder of record and you wish to attend the Pacific
Continental special meeting, please bring your proxy and evidence of your ownership of Pacific Continental common shares, such as
your most recent account statement, to the Pacific Continental special meeting. You should also bring valid picture identification.

If your Pacific Continental common shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or nominee and
you wish to attend the Pacific Continental special meeting, you need to bring a copy of a bank or brokerage statement to the Pacific
Continental special meeting reflecting your ownership of Pacific Continental common shares as of the record date. You should also
bring valid picture identification.

Solicitation of Proxies

The cost of solicitation of proxies for the Pacific Continental special meeting will be borne by Pacific Continental. Pacific
Continental will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in
sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Pacific Continental common shares. In addition to solicitations by mail, Pacific
Continental directors, officers and regular employees may solicit proxies personally or by telephone without additional compensation.

Delivery of Proxy Materials to Shareholders Sharing an Address

As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus is being delivered to multiple
shareholders of Pacific Continental sharing an address unless Pacific Continental has previously received contrary instructions from
one or more such shareholders. Shareholders who hold shares in “street name” can request further information on householding
through their brokers, banks or other holders of record. On written or oral request to Georgeson, Inc., Pacific Continental’s proxy
solicitor, at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10104, toll-free at (866) 357-4029, Georgeson, Inc. will
deliver promptly a separate copy of this document to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was
delivered.

PACIFIC CONTINENTAL PROPOSALS

Merger Proposal

As discussed throughout this document, Pacific Continental is asking its shareholders to approve the merger proposal. Holders of
Pacific Continental common shares should read this document carefully in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed
information concerning the merger agreement and the mergers. In particular, holders of Pacific Continental common shares are directed
to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The Pacific Continental board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation Proposal

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act,
Pacific Continental is seeking non-binding, advisory shareholder approval of the compensation of Pacific Continental’s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the mergers as disclosed in “The Mergers—Interests of Pacific Continental’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” beginning on page 80 and “Merger-Related Compensation for Pacific Continental’s
Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 85. The proposal gives Pacific Continental’s shareholders the opportunity to express
their views on the merger-related compensation of Pacific Continental’s named executive officers. Accordingly, Pacific Continental is
requesting that shareholders adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Pacific Continental’s named executive
officers, in connection with the mergers, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be
paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in ‘The Mergers—Interests of
Pacific Continental’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers’ and ‘Merger-Related Compensation for Pacific
Continental’s Named Executive Officers’ are hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote
not to approve this proposal on merger-related named executive officer compensation and vote to approve the merger agreement and
vice versa. You also may abstain from this proposal and vote on the merger proposal, or vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in
nature, it will not be binding on Pacific Continental, regardless of whether the merger agreement is approved. Approval of the non-
binding, advisory proposal with respect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Pacific Continental’s named
executive officers in connection with the mergers is not a condition to completion of the mergers, and failure to approve this advisory
matter will have no effect on the vote to approve the merger agreement. The merger-related named executive officer compensation that
may be paid or become payable in connection with the mergers is based on contractual arrangements with the named executive officers
and, accordingly, the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to make these payments.

The Pacific Continental board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the merger-related named executive officer
compensation proposal.

Pacific Continental Adjournment Proposal

The Pacific Continental special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Pacific Continental special meeting to approve the merger proposal.

Table of Contents

If, at the Pacific Continental special meeting, the number of Pacific Continental common shares present or represented and voting
in favor of the merger proposal is insufficient to approve the merger proposal, Pacific Continental intends to move to adjourn the
Pacific Continental special meeting in order to enable the Pacific Continental board of directors to solicit additional proxies for
approval of the merger agreement. In that event, Pacific Continental will ask its shareholders to vote only upon the Pacific Continental
adjournment proposal, and not the merger proposal or the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal.

In this proposal, Pacific Continental is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Pacific
Continental board of directors to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually,
to adjourn the Pacific Continental special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the
Pacific Continental shareholders approve the Pacific Continental adjournment proposal, Pacific Continental could adjourn the Pacific
Continental special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from Pacific
Continental shareholders who have previously voted.

The Pacific Continental board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the Pacific Continental adjournment proposal.

Other Matters to Come Before the Pacific Continental Special Meeting

No other matters are intended to be brought before the Pacific Continental special meeting by Pacific Continental, and Pacific
Continental does not know of any matters to be brought before the Pacific Continental special meeting by others. If, however, any other
matters properly come before the Pacific Continental special meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares represented
thereby in accordance with the judgment of management on any such matter.

that the mergers are not completed in 2017, or at all, any shareholder nominations or proposals intended to be presented at Pacific
Continental’s next annual meeting must be submitted a reasonable time prior to any such meeting to be considered timely.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 9, 2017 (this “Agreement”), is by and among
Columbia Banking System, Inc., a Washington corporation (“Parent”), Pacific Continental Corporation, an Oregon corporation (the
“Company”), and, from and after its accession to this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.18, Coast Merger Sub, an Oregon
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”).

RECITALS

A.    The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement
and have adopted this Agreement.

B.    On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the “First Merger”), with the Company as the surviving corporation in the First Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the “Surviving Corporation”).

C.    Immediately following the First Merger and as part of a single integrated transaction, the Surviving Corporation will
merge with and into Parent (the “Subsequent Merger”), with Parent as the surviving entity.

D.    Immediately following the Subsequent Merger, Pacific Continental Bank, an Oregon state-chartered bank and wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company (“Pacific Continental Bank”), will merge with and into Columbia State Bank, a Washington state-
chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Columbia Bank”), with Columbia Bank as the surviving bank (the “Bank
Merger,” and together with the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger, the “Mergers”).

E.    The parties intend that the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, shall be treated as a single
integrated transaction and shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that this Agreement shall constitute a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code.

F.    As an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, each of the members of the board of directors of the
Company (the “Company Board”) has simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting and Non-Competition Agreement (collectively,
the “Pacific Continental Voting Agreements”), each dated as of the date hereof and substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A-1.

G.    As an inducement for Company to enter into this Agreement, each of the members of the board of directors of Parent
(the “Parent Board”) has simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (collectively, the “Columbia Voting Agreements”),
each dated as of the date hereof and substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2.

H.    The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also
to prescribe certain conditions to the First Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
MERGERS

1.1    The First Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Oregon Revised Statutes
(the “ORS”) at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in the First Merger. The Company shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the First Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue its existence under the Laws of
the State of Oregon. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.

1.2    Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, the parties will
execute and cause articles of merger and a plan of merger (“Oregon Merger Filings”) relating to the First Merger to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Oregon (“Oregon Secretary”) as provided in Section 60.494 of the ORS. The First Merger shall
become effective at such time as such Oregon Merger Filings have been filed, or at such other time as may be specified therein. The
term “Effective Time” shall be the date and time when the First Merger becomes effective in accordance therewith.

1.3    Effects of the First Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the First Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the ORS.

1.4    Conversion of Stock At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,

interest), no later than the first payroll period following the Effective Time and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days
following the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cashout
Price over (B) the reference price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company SAR less applicable Taxes required to be

by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the “Letter of Transmittal”)) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

(b)    Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) accompanied by a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Exchanged Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after such surrender, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
respect of the Exchanged Shares represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

(c)    No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case
unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date
subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

(d)    In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing Exchanged Shares that are
not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the shares of Parent Common Stock plus any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing such Exchanged Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the
Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Exchanged Shares such
amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. If, prior to the Closing Date, the
Exchange Agent or Parent determines that any such deduction or withholding is so required as of the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify the Company and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Exchanged Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

(e)    After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

Time other than to settle transfers of such Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing any such shares of Company Common Stock are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article
II.

(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to
each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price for the Determination Period by (ii) the fraction of a
share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

(g)    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company as of the one (1) year
anniversary of the Effective Time will be transferred to Parent. In such event, any former shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of any fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(h)    In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Sections 3.2 and 3.8, which shall be true and correct in all respects with respect to it) shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and the
Company shall not be deemed to have breached any representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence or absence of any
fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or
events inconsistent with such representation or warranty contained in Article III, would cause the representation or warranty not to be
true in all material respects. Subject to the foregoing, except as disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with or
furnished to, the SEC by the Company prior to the date hereof which is publicly available (without giving effect to any amendment
thereof filed with or furnished to the SEC after the date hereof, but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading
“Risk Factors,” or disclosure of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly
non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as Previously Disclosed, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1    Corporate Organization.

(a)    Organization. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Oregon. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary. The Company is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956 (“BHC Act”).

(b)    Articles and Bylaws. True, complete and correct copies of the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
of the Company (the “Company Articles”), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Company Bylaws”), as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been publicly filed by the Company and made available to Parent. The
Company Articles and Company Bylaws made available to Parent are in full force and effect.

(c)    Subsidiaries. Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any Subsidiaries of such Subsidiaries), the ownership interest of the Company in each
such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary (other than with respect to the
preferred securities of Pacific Continental Capital Trust I and Foundation Statutory Trust I), and a description of the business of each
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Subsidiary that the Company considers to be “inactive,” a statement to that effect and a description of
the business previously conducted by such Subsidiary). Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly incorporated or duly formed, as
applicable to each such Subsidiary, and validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and

qualification necessary. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or distributions to
the Company, except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. As used in this Agreement, the term “Subsidiary” has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d)
of the BHC Act, except that when such term is used with respect to an entity that is not a bank holding company, the meaning shall
nonetheless be deemed to apply to such entity. The deposit accounts of each of its Subsidiaries that is an insured depository institution
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) through the Deposit

paid on or before the date hereof, have been accrued on the financial statements set forth in the Company SEC Reports to the extent
required under GAAP. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is either
(i) funded through an insurance company contract and is not a “welfare benefit fund” with the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or
(ii) unfunded.

(f)    (i) No Employee Benefit Plan is a “multiemployer plan” within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
(a “Multiemployer Plan”) or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a “Multiple Employer Plan”); (ii) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; (iii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full; and (iv) no Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title
IV or Section 302 of ERISA. “ERISA Affiliate” means, with respect to any entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade or business
that is a member of a group described in Section 414(b), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes the first
entity, trade or business, or that is a member of the same “controlled group” as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to
Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA. “Withdrawal Liability” means liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

(g)    There does not exist, nor to the Knowledge of the Company, do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or
4212 of ERISA. “Controlled Group Liability” means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302 of
ERISA, (iii) under sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuation coverage
requirements of section 601 et seq. of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code, and (v) under corresponding or similar provisions of
foreign Laws or regulations.

(h)    None of the Company and its Subsidiaries has any liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former
employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or other applicable Law and at no expense to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for post-retirement
welfare benefits.

(i)    Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted, threatened or instituted, or to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of
circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit against the Employee Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Employee Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Benefit Plans.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken corrective action or made a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program.
No audit or other proceeding by a Governmental Entity is pending or threatened with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

Company, threatened against or affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the current or former directors or executive officers of it
or any of its Subsidiaries and there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any claims against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no outstanding injunction, order, writ, award, judgment, settlement, arbitration ruling,

Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, and
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make all initial requisite regulatory filings on or before
February 23, 2017, and in any event as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (other than any notice to the Federal Reserve under its
regulations, which will be filed in accordance with the timing contemplated by such regulations). The Company and Parent shall have
the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws, all
the non-confidential information relating to the Company or Parent (excluding any confidential financial information relating to
individuals), as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations (collectively the “Approvals”) of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of
matters relating to such Approvals and the completion of the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c)    Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the First Merger, the
Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the Company’s and Parent’s shareholders and at the time of the Company Special
Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements were made,
not misleading. Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would
cause any of the statements in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform
the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as applicable.

(d)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be likely, in each case following the
Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent (measured on a scale relative to the Company) or a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially restrict or
impose a material burden on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or with respect to the business or operation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”).

(e)    Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially
delayed.

6.2    Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent agrees to
cooperate with the other and use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable on its part under this Agreement or under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Mergers, and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof.

6.3    Access to Information.

(a)    Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than
reports or documents that the Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law), (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (iii) access to the necessary information (including the
Company’s own good faith estimates as available and third-party reports, if any, commissioned by the Company at Parent’s request) in
order to prepare a good faith estimate of the potential impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to amounts
potentially payable to senior executives of the Company in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall furnish such reasonable information about it and its business as
is reasonably relevant to the Company and its shareholders in connection with the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest,
joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of
the preceding sentence apply. In addition to the foregoing, on an every other week basis, the Company shall provide Parent with a
listing of all new and renewed loans and loan modifications, loan payoffs and loan purchases in the preceding two weeks.

(b)    All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the parties dated as of July 27, 2016 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

(c)    No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any
representations, warranties or covenants of the other party set forth in this Agreement.

6.4    Shareholder Approval.

(a)    The Company agrees to take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws,
all action necessary to convene as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared

consider and to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.9(b) and (c), the Company Board shall at all times
prior to and during such Company Special Meeting recommend such approval and shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such
approval by its shareholders (the “Company Board Recommendation”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this
Agreement has terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the First Merger shall be submitted to the Company’s
shareholders at the Company Special Meeting whether or not (x) the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Change
of Recommendation or (y) any Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted
to the Company or any of its advisors. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the
Company Special Meeting; provided that the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the
Company Special Meeting (A) if on the date on which the Company Special Meeting is originally scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company shall adjourn the Company Special Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent,
which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval, (B) after consultation with Parent, if the
failure to adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the
distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or (C) after consultation with Parent,
for a single period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Parent may require the Company to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Special Meeting once for a period not to
exceed thirty (30) calendar days (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date) to solicit additional proxies
necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Once the Company has established the record date, in respect of the Company
Special Meeting (the “Company Record Date”), the Company shall not change such Company Record Date or establish a different
Company Record Date for the Company Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws.

(b)    Parent agrees to take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Articles and the Parent Bylaws, all action
necessary to convene as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after
the Form S-4 is declared effective), the Parent Special Meeting to consider and to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval. The Parent
Board shall at all times prior to and during such Parent Special Meeting recommend such approval and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit such approval by its shareholders. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, adjourn or
postpone the Parent Special Meeting; provided that Parent may, without the prior written consent of the Company, adjourn or postpone
the Parent Special Meeting (A) if on the date on which the Parent Special Meeting is originally scheduled, Parent has not received

prior written consent of the Company, unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws.

shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First Merger.

6.6    Employee Matters.

(a)    During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee who is actively employed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each, a “Continuing Employee”) while employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time with: (i) base salary no less favorable than the base salary provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) annual cash bonus opportunities no less favorable than annual cash bonus
opportunities provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent; and (iii) employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than employee benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent; provided, however, that until such
time as Parent shall cause Continuing Employees to participate in the benefit plans of Parent, a Continuing Employee’s continued
participation in the Employee Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provision of this sentence (it being understood that
participation in Parent benefit plans may commence at different times with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan).

From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and make the payments provided for, as required by the terms of, all
written employment agreements and change in control agreements with employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, subject to any limitations imposed under applicable Law or by any regulatory authority. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide each Continuing Employee who is not
party to an individual employment, severance or change of control agreement at the time of his or her termination of employment
whose employment is involuntarily terminated (other than under circumstances that constitute a termination for “cause”) with the
severance payments and/or benefits, if any, to which the Continuing Employee is entitled under Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Parent shall take, or shall cause the Surviving Company to take, other actions in accordance with Section 6.6 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b)    Upon Continuing Employees’ enrollment in Parent’s employee benefit plans, such Continuing Employees will,
consistent with the provisions of Section 6.6(a) above, become participants in all Parent’s employee benefit plans, practices, and
policies on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
prior service credit for each of Continuing Employee’s service with the Company, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, shall
be given by Parent with respect to all Parent’s retirement plans, employee benefit plans, practices, and policies to the extent that such
crediting of service does not result in duplication of benefits, but not for accrual of benefits under any defined benefit. If any
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in any Parent employee benefit plan, practice, or policy that provides medical,
hospitalization or dental benefits, Parent shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to (a) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent benefit plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Benefit Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (b) recognize for purposes of annual deductible
and out- of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable to Continuing Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under any Employee Benefit Plan on or prior to the Closing Date.

(c)    If requested in writing by Parent at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
(or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective not later than
the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, any Employee Benefit Plans that contain a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. In the event that Parent requests that such plan(s) be terminated, the Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan(s) has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent, approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld) not later than the Business Day immediately preceding
the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall have in effect a defined contribution plan that is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, which Plan shall accept the transfer of account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) of each participant in the Company savings plan as of the Closing Date.

(d)    From and after the date hereof, prior to making any written or oral communications to officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation, benefit or other employment-related matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication or talking
points, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

(e)    Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Benefit
Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans in accordance
their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of
any Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Company or any of their
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

6.7    Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

(a)    From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable documented attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent they are indemnified by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date
hereof, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b)    Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will provide director’s and officer’s liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) that serves to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A
coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for the Company) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by the Company; provided, however, that
in no event shall the Parent or Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the

aggregate for such six (6)-year period, an amount in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for any such insurance; provided, further, that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to maintain or obtain the
D&O Insurance called for by this Section 6.7(b), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to 200% of the current annual premium; provided, further, that
officers and directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to
Parent’s or the Surviving Corporation’s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such D&O Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time
and in lieu of the foregoing, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to purchase a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” policy for directors’
and officers’ liability insurance on the terms described in the prior sentence and fully pay for such policy prior to the Effective Time, at
an aggregate cost up to, but not exceeding 200% of the current annual premium for such insurance.

(c)    Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation thereof; provided that failure to
so notify will not affect the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.7(a) unless and to the extent that Parent
or the Surviving Corporation is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

(d)    In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph (d) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for
such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary
to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and provided, further,
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

6.8    Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16(b)-3. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.9    No Solicitation; Change in Company Board Recommendation.

(a)    The Company agrees that none of it or any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors and
employees will, and will cause its and its Subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, representatives, advisors and Affiliates not to, initiate,
solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any
Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort to attempt or make or implement a Company Acquisition Proposal.

(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time after the date hereof and prior to,
but not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition
Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company Board may, and may permit its Subsidiaries
and its and its Subsidiaries’ representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or engaging in
any negotiations, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less restrictive in the aggregate
to the counterparty than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which expressly permits the Company to comply with its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9. Subject to the foregoing and Section 6.9(c) below, the Company will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted on or before the date of this Agreement with any persons
other than Parent with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law,
to (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any Person (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement. The Company will promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, of any discussions or
negotiations that are sought to be initiated or continued or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent promptly apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
(including the terms and conditions of any such request, inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal, or all amendments or proposed
amendments thereto) on a current basis (it being understood that no such communications to Parent shall be deemed a Company
Adverse Change of Recommendation). The Company agrees that it shall contemporaneously provide to Parent any confidential or
nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be provided to any other Person in connection with
any Company Acquisition Proposal which has not previously been provided to Parent.

compliance with, Section 6.9(c)(ii)(B) hereof, make any Company Adverse Change of Recommendation; or (B) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.9(b) entered into in compliance with
Section 6.9(b)) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal made to the Company.

(ii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and
the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal;
provided that:

(A)    the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take

pursuant to Section 8.1(d), as applicable, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company Adverse Change of
Recommendation or termination, including the material terms of the Company Superior Proposal (a “Notice of Superior
Proposal”) (it being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Change of
Recommendation);

(C)    during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent (to the extent that
Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make an improved offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the
Company so that such Company Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and

(D)    at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period (or such earlier time that Parent advises the Company that it no
longer wishes to negotiate to amend this Agreement), the Company Board, after taking into account any modifications to the
terms of this Agreement and the First Merger agreed to by Parent after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.

(d)    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from complying with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that such rules will in no
way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, “Company Acquisition Proposal” means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or
other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more
than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any public announcement of a proposed plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreements to engage
in any of the foregoing, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any sale of whole loans and securitizations in
the ordinary course. As used in this Agreement, “Company Superior Proposal” means an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the First Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to be reasonably capable of being consummated
on the terms proposed, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
or financial advisory firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing)
and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable Law, and after taking into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement agreed to by Parent; provided that for purposes of the definition of “Company Superior Proposal,” the references to “more
than 15%” in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “at least 50%.”

6.10    Takeover Laws. No party will take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or
applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Laws become applicable to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the First Merger, the parties shall take all reasonable action
necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the First Merger, may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the First Merger.

6.11    Financial Statements and Other Current Information. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in
no event more than fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date hereof, the Company will furnish to
Parent, (a) consolidated financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and stockholders’ equity) of it and any
of its Subsidiaries (to the extent available)

circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances

6.13    Parent’s Board of Directors. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall

shall be entitled to compensation, indemnification and expense reimbursement in connection with his or her role as a director to the
same extent as other directors on the Parent Board and Columbia Bank Board. Upon Closing or promptly thereafter, Parent shall form
an advisory board and invite all members of the Company Board, as of the date hereof to join such advisory board on further terms and
conditions to be determined by Parent prior to Closing.

6.14    Company Trust Preferred Securities, FHLB Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures. The Company will cooperate with
Parent to effect the redemption or repayment, as applicable, of trust preferred securities under the indentures and guarantee agreements
relating thereto issued or assumed by the Company, and the discharge of Pacific Continental Bank’s FHLB borrowings, in each case
subject to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, and in each case, to the extent permitted by the terms of the governing
indentures and/or applicable governing documentation and subject to and in each case contingent upon regulatory approval. At the

issuance of $35,000,000 principal amount of its 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2026 (the
“Subordinated Debentures”) pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 27, 2016 (the “Indenture”), as supplemented by the First
Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 27, 2016, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the

agreements, including any supplemental indentures, guarantees, officer’s certificates, opinions of counsel and declarations of trust
required by the Indenture, or as may reasonably be requested by the Trustee thereunder, and thereafter shall perform all of the
Company’s obligations with respect to the Indenture.

6.15    Third-Party Agreements.

(a)    The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) the consents or waivers required to be obtained from
any third parties in connection with the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated

of such third parties to effect a smooth transition in accordance with the parties’ timetable at or after the Effective Time, including
those items set forth on Schedule 6.15(a). The Company shall cooperate with Parent as requested by Parent in minimizing the extent to

addition to complying with the prohibitions in Section 5.2.

production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the

calendar month-end and (b) itemized Transaction Expenses reasonably estimated to be incurred during the period from such calendar

6.17    Certain Tax Matters

(a)    Each of Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that it intends for U.S. federal income tax purposes that the

“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement for purposes of
Section 368(a) of the Code as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule to the contrary, none of the parties shall (and each Party shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to) take or agree to take
any action that would prevent or impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the First Merger and the Subsequent
Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering customary tax representation
letters to the Company’s and/or Parent’s counsel, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, in
connection with (i) any tax opinion or description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the First Merger and the Subsequent
Merger contained or set forth in the Form S-4 and (ii) the tax opinions referenced in Section 7.3(e) or Section 7.2(e). The parties intend
to report and, except to the extent otherwise required, shall report, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the First Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, as a “reorganization” within the mean of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(c)    After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
with respect to Tax matters relevant to integrating their respective Subsidiaries and operations.

Promptly following the incorporation of Merger Sub, (a) Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve this Agreement
and (b) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accede to this Agreement by executing a signature page to this Agreement, after which time,

(e)    Parent Average Closing Price Decline – by either Parent or the Company immediately following the Determination
Date, in the event the Parent Average Closing Price, for the Determination Period is less than $26.13 (with a proportionate adjustment
in the event that outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any stock
dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this
Agreement and the Determination Date); provided, however, if Parent elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section

their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under
this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that (i) Sections 6.3(b), 8.2, 8.3, and 9.3
through 9.11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) neither the Company nor Parent shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its knowing breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of the
Company, shall include the loss to the Company’s shareholders of the economic benefits of the First Merger).

8.3    Fees and Expenses.

(a)    All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Mergers, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the First Merger is consummated, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3(b).

(b)    Company Termination Fee.

(i)    In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (Company Superior Proposal)
or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (No Company Recommendation), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee, in immediately
available funds, in the amount of $18,750,000 (the “Company Termination Fee”) by wire transfer to an account specified by
Parent promptly, but in any event prior to or concurrently with a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or no later than two
(2) Business Days after the date of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c).

(ii)    In the event that any Person shall have made a Company Acquisition Proposal, which proposal has been publicly
announced, disclosed or proposed and not withdrawn, and:

(1)    thereafter this Agreement is terminated:

(a)    by either party pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) (Delay), or Section 8.1(b)(iv)(A) (No Shareholder Approval);
or

(b)    by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) (Breach); and

(2)    within twelve (12) months after such termination of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have
been consummated or any definitive agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been entered
into (provided that for purposes of the foregoing, the term “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 6.9(d) except that the references to “more than 15%” in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “at least 50%”);

        then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer to an account specified
by Parent prior to the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, such
Company Acquisition Proposal. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Parent the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

(c)    Liquidated Damages. The Company and Parent and acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties would enter
into this Agreement. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty
and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of termination of this Agreement under such applicable section. In the
event that the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable under this Section 8.3, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent
for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such
overdue amount, and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at
a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made.

8.4    Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the First Merger by the shareholders of the
Company or Parent; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such
shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further
approval under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties.

based on any matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and hereby
irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each

has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

9.8    Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy that may arise under this Agreement,
and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action, directly or
indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or any documents referred to in this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party

otherwise make any public statement, or, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic
information to a third party, concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by the Company, or the
Company, in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Parent; provided, however, that either Parent or the
Company may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable
under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the extent required by
Law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

Agreement shall be assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null
and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs and representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person,
other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement.

9.11    Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek

Appendix B

FORM OF VOTING AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

This Voting and Non-Competition Agreement (the “Agreement”), dated as of January 9, 2017, is entered into by and among
Coast, a Washington corporation (“Parent”), Pool, an Oregon corporation (the “Company”), and the member of the board of directors
of the Company (the “Company Board”) whose name appears on the signature page hereto (the “Director”).

RECITALS
 

A. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended or supplemented, the “Merger
Agreement”), dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, the Company, and from and after its accession to the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof, Merger Sub, an Oregon corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”),
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “First Merger”), with the Company as the surviving corporation in the
First Merger (sometimes hereafter referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”). Immediately following the First Merger, the
Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Parent (the “Subsequent Merger”), with Parent as the surviving entity, and
immediately following the Subsequent Merger, Pool Bank, an Oregon state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (“Pool Bank”), will merge with and into Coast Bank, a Washington state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (“Coast Bank”) with Coast Bank as the surviving bank (together with the Merger and Subsequent Merger, the
“Mergers”).

 

B. The parties to this Agreement believe that the future success and profitability of Parent and its Subsidiaries following the Mergers
(the “Combined Company”) requires that the Director be subject to the restrictions set forth herein with respect to competitive
activities following the Effective Time as set forth herein.

 

C. As an inducement and a condition to Parent entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that the Director, in his or
her capacity as a shareholder of the Company, enter into this Agreement to make more likely the approval of the Merger
Agreement by the requisite vote of the Company’s shareholders, to minimize the risk that Parent will lose the benefit of the
goodwill and other assets being acquired by it, and to protect the trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information
of the Company known to the Director and being acquired by Parent.

AGREEMENT

In consideration of each of Parent’s and the Company’s performance under the Merger Agreement, the Director hereby agrees as
follows:

1.    Definitions. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the meaning assigned to those terms in the Merger
Agreement. The following definitions also apply to this Agreement:

(a)    Competing Business. “Competing Business” means any depository, wealth management or trust business company or
holding company thereof (including without limitation, any start-up bank or bank in formation) operating anywhere within the Covered
Area.

(b)    Covered Area. “Covered Area” means the State of Washington and the State of Oregon.

(c)    Term. “Term” means the period of time beginning on the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the Effective Time.

Table of Contents

2.    Effectiveness. If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its terms, this Agreement (other than
Sections 5 and 6 and Sections 17 through 24) shall automatically terminate and be null and void and of no effect.

3.    No Solicitation. During the Term, the Director will not, directly or indirectly, either for him/her self or any other Person,
(a) solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce (i) any employees or independent contractors (or any former employees or
independent contractors who were employees or independent contractors of Parent, the Company or the Combined Company within
the six months preceding such solicitation) of Parent, the Company or the Combined Company to participate, as an employee or
otherwise, in any manner in a Competing Business, (ii) any customers, business partners or joint venturers of Parent, the Company or
the Combined Company to transfer their business to a Competing Business or to reduce their business or cease conducting business
with Parent, the Company or the Combined Company, or (iii) the termination of an employment or contractual relationship between
Parent, the Company or the Combined Company and any employee, independent contractor, customer, business partner or joint
venturer, (b) hire any Person then employed by the Combined Company, or who was employed by Parent, the Company, the Combined
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time or during the Term; provided, however, the
Director shall not be prohibited from, directly or indirectly, hiring (or engaging as an independent contractor) for him/her self and not
in contravention of Section 4 of this Agreement, former employees of the Company, Parent or the Combined Company if such
employees were terminated by Parent, the Company or the Combined Company, a period of one-hundred twenty (120) days from the
date of such former employee’s termination has passed and whom neither the Director nor any Person acting on behalf of the Director,
directly or indirectly solicited following the date hereof or (c) in any other way interfere with or disrupt the Combined Company’s
relationship with any of its employees, independent contractors, customers, business partners or joint venturers. Solicitation prohibited
under this Section 3 includes solicitation by any means, including, without limitation, meetings, letters or other mailings, electronic
communications of any kind, and internet communications but shall not include general solicitations of any kind which are not
specifically targeted at any Persons described in clauses (a)(i), (ii) and (iii), above.

4.    Participation in Competing Business. Except as provided in Section 7 and Section 8, during the Term, the Director will not
become involved with a Competing Business or serve, directly or indirectly, a Competing Business in any manner, including without
limitation as a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, trustee, employee, advisor,
consultant, agent, or representative, or otherwise become involved in any manner in the organization, pre-opening phases, or the
formation of a Competing Business; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth herein shall not prevent the
Director from utilizing the services of any Competing Business.

5.    Confidential Information. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Director shall not at any time, directly or
indirectly, divulge, reveal or communicate any Confidential Information of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
obtained by such Person while serving as a director of the Company or Pool Bank to any Person, or use any Confidential Information
for his or her own benefit or for the benefit of any other Person except in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order in
compliance with Section 6. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall include (a) all secrets and other
confidential information, ideas, knowledge, knowhow, techniques, secret processes, improvements, discoveries, methods, inventions,
sales, financial information, customers, lists of customers and prospective customers, broker lists, potential brokers, rate sheets, plans,
concepts, strategies or products, as well as all documents, reports, drawings, designs, plans, and proposals otherwise pertaining to
same, with respect to Parent, the Company, the Combined Company or their respective Subsidiaries, plus any non-public personal
information on any present or past customer or client of the Company, Pool Bank or the Combined Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, “Confidential Information” does not include (a) information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than
as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by the Director; (b) information that was in the Director’s possession prior to serving as a
director or information received by the Director from another Person without any limitations on disclosure, but only if the Director had
no reason to believe that the other Person was prohibited

Table of Contents

from using or disclosing the information by a contractual or fiduciary obligation; or (c) information that was independently developed
by the Director without using any Confidential Information of Parent, the Company, the Combined Company or their respective
Subsidiaries.

6.    Legally Required Disclosure. If the Director is requested or required by any tribunal or government agency (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other
similar process), to disclose any Confidential Information that would violate the other provisions of this Agreement, the Director shall
provide Parent with prompt notice of any such request or requirement and shall provide, at Parent’s expense, such reasonable
cooperation as Parent may request so that Parent may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement as it would apply to such requested or required disclosure. If, in the absence of a protective order
or other remedy or the receipt of a written waiver from Parent, the Director is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Confidential
Information to any tribunal or government agency, the Director may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal or
government agency only that portion of Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the Director
exercises his or her reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by
reasonably cooperating with Parent, at Parent’s expense, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information by such tribunal or government agency.

7.    Outside Covered Area; Requests for Waivers or Permission. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Director from
becoming involved with, as a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, trustee, employee,
consultant, agent, representative, or otherwise, with a Competing Business that has no places of business or other operations in the
Covered Area. Prior to engaging in any manner in a Competing Business, the Director may request in writing that Parent waive the
restrictions set forth in this Agreement with respect to a particular proposed activity. If Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that
such activity is acceptable, Parent shall provide the Director with a written consent to engage in such activity, and such activity shall
thereafter not be a Competing Business.

8.    Passive Interest. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Director from passively owning, directly or indirectly, individually
or in the aggregate (including without limitation by being a member of a group within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange
Act), 3% or less of any class of security of a Competing Business or securities of any Competing Business that has a class of securities
registered pursuant to the Exchange Act.

9.    Reasonableness of Restrictions. The Director acknowledges and represents that the covenants set forth above represent only
a limited restraint and allow the Director to pursue his or her occupation without unreasonable or unfair restrictions. The Director
acknowledges that the limitations of length of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in this Agreement are reasonable
because, among other things: (A) the Company and Parent are engaged in a highly competitive industry, (B) the Director has had
unique access to the trade secrets and know-how of the Company and Parent, including the plans and strategy (and, in particular, the
competitive strategy) of the Combined Company, and (C) this Agreement provides no more protection than is necessary to protect

limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. The
Director further represents and warrants that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the compliance with the
provisions hereof do not and will not (x) constitute or result in a breach or violation of, a default (or event which, with notice or lapse

of, or result in the creation of any Lien on any property or asset of the Director pursuant to any agreement, indenture, instrument, law,
rule or regulation, judgment, decree, order, governmental permit, writ, injunction, or applicable license, to which the Director is a party
or by which the Director or any property or asset of the Director is bound or affected, or (y) require any permit, authorization, consent

instrument.

including the right to vote any Owned Shares, as applicable (each a “Transfer”), (ii) grant any proxies, or enter into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with respect to a Transfer of the Owned Shares, as applicable, or (iii) take any other action, that would

prohibit the Director from (a) Transfers for estate planning or philanthropic purposes so long as the transferee, prior to the date of
Transfer, agrees in a signed writing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement or (b) disposing of or

transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or
otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that
he, she or it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

and without any action on the part of Columbia, Merger Sub, Pacific, the holders of common stock, no par value per share, of Pacific
(“Pacific Common Stock”) or the holders of common stock, no par value per share, of Columbia (“Columbia Common Stock”), each
share of Pacific Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Shares (as
defined in the Agreement)) shall be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of 0.6430 of a share of Columbia
Common Stock, which consideration is subject to adjustment as further provided in the Agreement (as to which we express no
opinion). The ratio of 0.6430 of a share of Columbia Common Stock for one share of Pacific Common Stock is referred to herein as the
“Exchange Ratio. The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

The Agreement further provides that, immediately following the closing of the Transaction, Pacific Continental Bank, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Pacific, will merge with and into Columbia State Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia (“Columbia
Bank”), with Columbia Bank as the surviving entity, pursuant to a separate agreement of merger (such transaction, the “Bank Merger”).

KBW has acted as financial advisor to Columbia and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our investment
banking business, we are continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation
of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of our and their broker-dealer businesses, and further to certain existing sales and trading
relationships between Columbia and certain KBW affiliates, we and our affiliates may from time to time purchase securities from, and
sell securities to, Columbia and Pacific, and as a market maker in securities, we and our affiliates may from time to time have a long or
short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Columbia or Pacific for our and their own accounts and for the accounts of
our and their respective customers and clients. We have acted exclusively for the board of directors of Columbia (the “Board”) in
rendering this

opinion and will receive a fee from Columbia for our services. A portion of our fee is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a
significant portion is contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. In addition, Columbia has agreed to indemnify us
for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

In addition to this present engagement, in the past two years, KBW has from time to time provided other investment banking
assistance to Columbia, for which KBW did not enter into any engagement agreement or receive compensation. Prior to the past two
years, KBW acted as financial advisor to Columbia in connection with its November 2014 acquisition of Intermountain Community
Bancorp and received compensation for such services. In the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial
advisory services to Pacific. We may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Columbia or Pacific
and receive compensation for such services.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of Columbia and Pacific and bearing upon the Transaction, including among other things, the following: (i) a draft of the
Agreement dated January 4, 2017 (the most recent draft made available to us); (ii) the audited financial statements and the Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 of Columbia; (iii) the unaudited quarterly financial
statements and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016
of Columbia; (iv) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31,
2015 of Pacific; (v) the unaudited quarterly financial statements and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended
March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 of Pacific; (vi) certain regulatory filings of Columbia and Pacific and their
respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FRY-9C and quarterly call reports filed with respect to each quarter
during the three year period ended December 31, 2015 and the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016;
(vii) certain other interim reports and other communications of Columbia and Pacific to their respective stockholders; and (viii) other
financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Columbia and Pacific furnished to us by Columbia and
Pacific or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of our analysis. Our consideration of financial information and other
factors that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our analyses included, among others, the following: (i) the
historical and current financial position and results of operations of Columbia and Pacific; (ii) the assets and liabilities of Columbia and
Pacific; (iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry; (iv) a
comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Columbia and Pacific with similar information for certain other
companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; (v) publicly-available consensus “street estimates” of Pacific, as well as
assumed Pacific long term growth rates provided to us by Columbia management, all of which information was discussed with us by
such management and used and relied upon by us, based on such discussions, at the direction of Columbia management and with the
consent of the Board; (vi) publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Columbia, as well as assumed Columbia long-term growth
rates provided to us by Columbia management, all of which information was discussed with us by such management and used and
relied upon by us at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Board; and (vii) estimates regarding certain pro
forma financial effects of the Transaction on Columbia (including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the Transaction) that were prepared by Columbia management, provided to and discussed with us by such
management, and used and relied upon by us at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Board. We have also
performed such other studies and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into account our assessment of general
economic, market and financial conditions and our experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities valuation
and knowledge of the banking industry generally.

We have also participated in discussions that were held by managements of Columbia and Pacific regarding the past and current
business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of each of their respective companies and such other
matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.

In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial and other information provided to us or that was publicly available and we have not independently verified the accuracy
or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. We
have relied upon the management of Columbia as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street
estimates” of Columbia and Pacific (and the assumed long-term growth rates of Columbia and Pacific) referred to above that were
provided to or otherwise discussed with us by such management, and that in each case we were directed by such management to use.
We have further relied upon such management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the estimates regarding certain pro forma
financial effects of the Transaction on Columbia (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result
or be derived from the Transaction) referred to above. We have assumed, at the direction of Columbia, that all of the foregoing
information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting, or in the case of the Columbia and Pacific publicly available “street
estimates” referred to above that such estimates are consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Columbia
management, and that the forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information will be realized in the amounts and in the
time periods currently estimated. As you are aware, the financial and operating forecasts, projections and estimates of Pacific that we
were directed by Columbia management to use reflect differences from the forecasts, projections and estimates that were prepared by
Pacific and provided to Columbia. Accordingly, with the consent of Columbia, in rendering our opinion, our reliance upon Columbia
management as to the reasonableness and achievability of such information includes reliance upon the judgments and assessments of
Columbia and Columbia management with respect to such differences.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Columbia and Pacific that was provided to us was not
prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available
consensus “street estimates” of Columbia and Pacific referred to above that we were directed to use, is based on numerous variables
and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed,
based on discussions with the respective managements of Columbia and Pacific, and with the consent of the Board, that all such
information provides a reasonable basis upon which we could form our opinion and we express no view as to any such information or
the assumptions or bases therefor. We have relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in
any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

We also have assumed that there have been no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of either Columbia or Pacific since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made
available to us and that we were directed to use. We are not experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for
loan and lease losses and we have assumed, without independent verification and with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for
loan and lease losses for each of Columbia and Pacific are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering our opinion, we have not made
or obtained any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
Columbia or Pacific, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we
examined any individual loan or credit files, nor

did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Columbia or Pacific under any state or federal laws, including those
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or
necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to
uncertainty, we assume no responsibility or liability for their accuracy. With respect to any litigation to which Pacific is or has been a
party, we have relied upon the assessments of Columbia’s management and counsel as to all matters relating to such litigation and have
assumed, without verification, that there will be no developments that would be material to our analyses.

We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Transaction and any related transactions
(including the Bank Merger) will be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of
which we have assumed will not differ in any respect material to our analyses from the draft version reviewed) with no adjustments to
the Exchange Ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of the Pacific Common Stock; (ii) that the representations
and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the Agreement are true and
correct; (iii) that each party to the Agreement or any of the related documents will perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by such party under such documents; (iv) that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse
conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the Transaction or any related transaction (including the Bank
Merger) and that all conditions to the completion of the Transaction and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger) will be
satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and (v) that in the course of obtaining
the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Transaction and any related transactions (including the
Bank Merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications,
will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Columbia, Pacific
or the pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction, including the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the Transaction. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other
applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further been advised by representatives of Columbia that Columbia
has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax,
accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Columbia, Merger Sub, Pacific, the Transaction and any related transaction
(including the Bank Merger), and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to any such matters.

This opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio in the Initial
Merger to Columbia. We express no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the Transaction or any term or aspect of any
related transaction (including the Bank Merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any related
transaction, any consequences of the Transaction to Columbia, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or
implications of any employment, retention, consulting, voting, support, cooperation, stockholder or other agreements, arrangements or
understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Transaction, any related transaction, or otherwise. Our opinion is
necessarily based upon conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof and the information made available to us
through the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion reached in this opinion and that KBW
does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address, and we express no view or opinion
with respect to, (i) the underlying business decision of Columbia to engage in the Transaction or enter into the Agreement, (ii) the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been

officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Columbia Common Stock
or relative to the Exchange Ratio, (v) the effect of the Transaction or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger) on, or the
fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of Columbia, Pacific or any other party to any
transaction contemplated by the Agreement, (vi) any adjustment (as provided in the Agreement) to the Exchange Ratio assumed for
purposes of our opinion, (vii) any payment of cash consideration in respect of the Pacific Common Stock (as provided in the
Agreement) in the event certain conditions as further described in the Agreement are met, including without limitation, in the event the
respective conditions in connection therewith are so met, any election by Columbia to pay cash consideration in lieu of an adjustment
to the Exchange Ratio and any election by Pacific to receive cash consideration, (viii) whether Columbia has sufficient cash, available
lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay any cash consideration in respect of the Pacific Common Stock (if
applicable); (ix) the actual value of Columbia Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Initial Merger, (x) the prices, trading
range or volume at which Columbia Common Stock or Pacific Common Stock will trade following the public announcement of the
Transaction or the prices, trading range or volume at which Columbia Common Stock will trade following the consummation of the
Transaction, (xi) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the Transaction or any other transaction
contemplated by the Agreement, or (xii) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Columbia, Pacific, Merger
Sub, any of their respective stockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the Transaction or any other related
transaction (including the Bank Merger), including whether or not the Transaction will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United
States federal income tax purposes.

This opinion is for the information of, and is directed to, the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of
the financial terms of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to how it should vote on the
Transaction or to any holder of Columbia Common Stock or any stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with
the Transaction or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such stockholder should enter
into a voting, stockholders’, affiliates’ or other agreement with respect to the Transaction or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights
that may be available to such stockholder.

This opinion has been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures
established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio in the Initial Merger is
fair, from a financial point of view, to Columbia.

Board of Directors
Pacific Continental Corporation
111 West Seventh Avenue
Eugene, OR 97401

Members of the Board:

We understand that Pacific Continental Corporation (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “Agreement”) with Columbia Banking System, Inc. (“Parent”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will merge
with and into Parent (the “Transaction”) with Parent as the surviving entity, and each share of the common stock of the Company (the
“Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to 0.6430 (the “Exchange Ratio”). The Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustments
pursuant to the Agreement, as to which adjustments we express no opinion. The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully
set forth in the Agreement.

Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock
of the Exchange Ratio to be paid to such holders in the proposed Transaction.

In connection with preparing our opinion, we have reviewed, among other things:
 

 (i) a draft of the Agreement, dated January 4, 2017;
 

 
(ii) certain financial statements and other historical financial and business information about the Parent and the Company

made available to us from published sources and/or from the internal records of the Parent and the Company that we
deemed relevant;

 

 
(iii) certain publicly available analyst earnings estimates for Parent for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31,

2017 and December 31, 2018 and estimated long-term growth rate for the years thereafter, in each case as discussed with,
and confirmed by, senior management of the Company and Parent;

 

 
(iv) certain publicly available analyst earnings estimates for the Company for the years ending December 31,

2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and estimated long-term growth rate for the years thereafter, in each
case as discussed with, and confirmed by, senior management of the Company;

 

 (v) the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular;

 (vi) the financial terms of certain other transactions in the financial institutions industry, to the extent publicly available;
 

 (vii) the market and trading characteristics of public companies and public bank holding companies in particular;
 

 (viii) the relative contributions of the Parent and Company to the combined company;
 

 
(ix) the pro forma financial impact of the Transaction, taking into consideration the amounts and timing of the transaction

costs and cost savings;
 (x) the net present value of the Company with consideration of projected financial results;
 

 (xi) the net present value of Parent with consideration of projected financial results; and
 

 

(xii) such other financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria and other information
as we considered relevant including discussions with management and other representatives and advisors of the Parent
and the Company concerning the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Parent and the
Company.

In arriving at our opinion, we have, with your consent, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with or reviewed by or for us. We have not
independently verified (nor have we assumed responsibility for independently verifying) such information or its accuracy or
completeness. We have not undertaken or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company, and we did not make an independent appraisal or analysis of the Company with respect to
the Transaction. In addition, we have not assumed any obligation to conduct, nor have we conducted, any physical inspection of the
properties or facilities of the Company, and have not been provided with any reports of such physical inspections. We have assumed
that there has been no material change in the Company’s business, assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or
prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements provided to us, and that neither the Company nor Parent is party to any
material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off,
other than the Transaction.

With respect to the financial forecasts and other analyses (including information relating to certain pro forma financial effects of,
and strategic implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from, the Transaction) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or
for or discussed with us, we have been advised by management of the Company, and have assumed with your consent, that such
forecasts and other analyses were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the other matters covered
thereby, and that the financial results (including the potential strategic implications and operational benefits anticipated to result from
the Transaction) reflected in such forecasts and analyses will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected. We assume no
responsibility for and express no opinion as to these forecasts and analyses or the assumptions on which they were based. We have
relied on the assurances of management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of
such information, forecasts or analyses inaccurate or misleading.

We are not experts in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios, classified loans or other real estate owned or in assessing the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses with respect thereto, and we did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal thereof, or
of any other specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Parent or any of
their respective subsidiaries. We have not reviewed any individual loan or credit files relating to the Company or Parent. We have
assumed, with your consent, that the respective allowances for loan and lease losses for both the Company and Parent are adequate to
cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity. We did not make an independent evaluation of the
quality of the Company’s or Parent’s deposit base, nor have we independently evaluated potential deposit

concentrations or the deposit composition of the Company or Parent. We did not make an independent evaluation of the quality of the
Company’s or Parent’s investment securities portfolio, nor have we independently evaluated potential concentrations in the investment
securities portfolio of the Company or Parent.

We have assumed that all of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and all related agreements are true and
correct in all respects material to our analysis, and that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or covenant thereof the effect of which would be in any
respect material to our analysis. We also have assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals, and
waivers necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any material adverse effect on the Company or the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction. Further, we have assumed that the executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect
from the draft Agreement, dated January 4, 2017, reviewed by us.

We have assumed in all respects material to our analysis that the Company will remain as a going concern for all periods relevant
to our analysis. We express no opinion regarding the liquidation value of the Company or any other entity.

Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to be paid to the holders of the
Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other
term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction (including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction) or any term or
aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into in connection with the Transaction,
including the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the
Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, relative to the Exchange Ratio to be paid to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the Transaction, or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative
business transactions or strategies, or whether such alternative transactions or strategies could be achieved or are available. We note
that we were not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any
part of the Company or any other alternative transaction or strategy. In addition, our opinion does not address any legal, regulatory, tax
or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified
professionals.

We do not express any opinion as to the value of any asset of the Company whether at current market prices or in the future, or as
to the price at which the Company or its assets could be sold in the future. We also express no opinion as to the price at which the
Company Common Stock or Parent will trade following announcement of the Transaction or at any future time.

We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. This opinion is not a solvency opinion and does not in any way address the solvency or financial
condition of the Parent. We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the
Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.

We have acted as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a
portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of
the Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our reasonable expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities
arising out of our engagement.

During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we have provided investment banking and other financial services to the
Company for which we have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as the
Company’s financial advisor on its acquisition of Foundation Bancorp, Inc. in 2016 and on its acquisition of Capital Pacific Bancorp in
2015.

In the ordinary course of our business, D.A. Davidson & Co. and its affiliates may actively trade or hold securities of the
Company or Parent for our own accounts or for the accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short
positions in such securities. We may seek to provide investment banking or other financial services to the Company or Parent in the
future for which we would expect to receive compensation.

This fairness opinion was reviewed and approved by a D.A. Davidson & Co. Fairness Opinion Committee.

It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with and for the
purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. This opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation as to how
the shareholders of the Company should vote or act with respect to the Transaction or any matter relating thereto.

This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and shall not be disclosed, referred to, published or
otherwise used (in whole or in part), nor shall any public references to us be made, without our prior written consent, except that a copy
